TI  == microbial inhibition of oral epithelial wound recovery: potential role for quorum sensing molecules?
AB  == awareness of the impact of microbiota in both health and disease is growing. using a new in vitro oral mucosa co-culture model, we recently showed a clear inhibition of epithelial wound healing in the presence of an oral microbial community. in this paper, we have used the same model in combination with specific oral microbial species to obtain a better insight into the role of the oral microbiota in wound healing. monocultures of klebsiella oxytoca and lactobacillus salivarius significantly inhibited wound healing with ~20%, whereas streptococcus mitis and s. oralis enhanced the healing process with ~15% in 24 h. yet, neither s. oralis or s. mitis were able to counteract the inhibitory effects from k. oxytoca on wound healing. other tested microbial species had no effect on wound healing. apart from this species-dependency, the inhibitory effect on wound healing depended on a microbial threshold concentration. further mechanistic experiments with k. oxytoca excluded different microbial factors and hypothesized that quorum sensing molecules might play a role in the inter-kingdom signalling during wound healing. these results are important for the development of new strategies for the management of (infected) wounds and ulcerations.

TI  == effect of probiotic containing ice-cream on salivary mutans streptococci (sms) levels in children of 6-12 years of age: a randomized controlled double blind study with six-months follow up.
AB  == introduction: to evaluate the caries risk based on the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans in children of 6-12 years of age group before and after consuming probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5. materials and methods: a double blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out in 60 children aged between 6 to 12 years with zero decayed, missing, and filled teeth (dmft). they were randomly divided into two equal groups. saliva sample were collected before the consumption of ice-cream and streptococcus mutans count was calculated and recorded as baseline  data. for the next seven days both the groups were given ice creams marked as a and b. saliva samples were collected after ice-cream consumption at the end of study period and also after a washout period of 30 days and again after six months. samples were inoculated and colonies were counted. results: on statistical evaluation by students paired t-test, probiotic ice-cream brought significant reduction in the streptococcus mutans count after seven days of ice-cream ingestion (p<0.001) and also after 30 d of washout period (p<0.001). there was no significant reduction (p=0.076) by normal ice-cream consumption. after six months of the study period in both the groups the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was similar to the baseline. conclusion: probiotic ice-cream containing bifidobacterium lactis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 can cause reduction in caries causative organism. the dosage of the probiotic organisms for the long term or synergetic effect on the oral health are still needed to be explored.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == species-specific difference in antimicrobial susceptibility among viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == background: viridans group streptococci (vgs) are both commensal microbes and potential pathogens. increasing resistance to penicillin in vgs is an ongoing issue in the clinical environment. we investigated the difference in susceptibility and resistance to penicillin among various vgs species. methods: in total 1,448 vgs isolated from various clinical specimens were analyzed over a  two-yr period. identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed by the automated vitek 2 system (biomerieux, france) or the microscan microstrep  system (siemens, germany). results: among the 1,448 isolates, 412 were isolated from blood (28.4%). streptococcus mitis group was the most frequently isolated (589 isolates, 40.7%), followed by the s. anginosus group (290 isolates, 20.0%),  s. sanguinis group (179 isolates, 12.4%) and s. salivarius group (57 isolates, 3.9%). in total, 314 isolates could not be identified up to the species level. the overall non-susceptibility to penicillin was observed to be 40.0% (resistant, 11.2% and intermediately resistant, 28.8%) with uneven distribution among groups; 40.2% in s. sanguinis group (resistant, 5.0% and intermediately resistant, 35.2%), 60.3% in s. mitis group (resistant, 20.9% and intermediately resistant, 39.4%), 78.9% in s. salivarius group (resistant, 8.8% and intermediately resistant, 70.1%), and 6.2% in s. anginosus group (resistant, 1.7% and intermediately resistant, 4.5%). conclusions: antimicrobial resistance patterns towards penicillin show differences among various vgs; this should be considered  while devising an effective antimicrobial treatment against vgs.

TI  == recolonization of mutans streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. in this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine  gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. on each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (tm); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (ts) and on mitis  salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (ms). chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of ms and the proportion of ms with regard to total microorganisms (%ms/tm) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for ms and 21 days for  %ms/tm. the counts of tm and ts and the proportion of ms to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. the results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on  suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.

TI  == identification of non-streptococcal organisms from human dental plaque grown on the streptococcus-selective medium mitis-salivarius agar.
AB  == objective: mitis-salivarius (ms) agar has been used widely in microbial epidemiological studies because oral viridans streptococci can be selectively grown on this medium. even though the previous findings reported the limited selecting power of ms agar for streptococcus strains, the identities of non-streptococcal strains from human oral samples which can grow on this medium are not clear yet. in this study, we identified non-streptococcal organisms grown on ms agar plates by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. design: eighty bacterial colonies on ms plates were isolated from plaque samples, and bacterial identification was achieved with the rapid id 32 strep system and mini api reader. the bacterial colonies identified as non-streptococci by the api system were selected for further identification. the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr and verified using dna sequencing analysis for identification. sequences were compared with those of reference organisms in the genome database of the national center for biotechnology information using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). results: among the 11 isolated non-streptococcal strains on ms plates, 3 strains  were identified as actinomyces naeslundii, 7 strains were identified as actinomyces oris and 1 strain were identified as actinomyces sp. using blastn. conclusions: in this study, we showed that some oral actinomyces species can grow on streptococcus-selective ms agar plates.

TI  == cariogenic bacteria and dental health status in adolescents: the role of oral health behaviours.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the association between dental health status and levels of cariogenic bacteria in teenagers and the influence of behaviours and socio-demographic background on levels of bacteria. materials and methods: study  design: a cross-sectional population-based sample of 13-year-old adolescents (112 females and 78 males, total 190) was examined. the number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs), plaque and hygiene index were recorded according to the who criteria. the saliva samples were collected in a sterile container and then analysed by culture on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar for mutans streptococci and on man rogosa sharp (mrs) agar for lactobacilli. the levels of bacteria were expressed as the number of colonies forming units per millilitre of saliva (cfu/ml). associations between levels of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and dental health were estimated by odds ratio (or) and 95% confidence interval (95% ci) using unconditional logistic regression. results: no mutans streptococci were detected in 53.2% of the adolescents but 22.6% presented >/= 10(3) cfu/ml. for lactobacilli, these values were, respectively 43.7% and 34.7%. after adjustment for gender and social class, the or (95% ci) for dmfs >5  was 8.66 (3.57-21.02) if mutans streptococci >/= 10(3) cfu and 2.11 (0.96-4.64) if lactobacilli >/= 10(3) cfu. conclusion: this data allow us to conclude that hygiene habits and dental visits are not associated with high levels of cariogenic bacteria, but high scores of dmfs were found in adolescents with high  levels of mutans streptococci and lower parents' education.

TI  == the influence of antibacterial toothpastes on in vitro streptococcus mutans biofilm formation: a continuous culture study.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vitro effect of five toothpastes containing antimicrobial compounds including fluoride, triclosan or hydroxyapatite nano-particles on streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) biofilm formation. fluoride uptake by enamel after bacterial challenge was also evaluated. methods: human enamel disks (n= 192) were randomly divided into six groups and brushed with five different toothpastes while the control group was brushed with distilled water. each group was incubated for 24 and 72 hours with a s. mutans biofilm growing on  a modified drip-flow reactor (mdfr). biofilm formation was determined using a viable biomass assay based on a tetrazolium salt (mtt) and evaluated morphologically with confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) and scanning electron-microscopy (sem). fluoride uptake was evaluated using the enamel biopsy  technique. biofilm formation was also evaluated using 120 disks randomly divided  into the same six groups. the number of viable bacteria was determined through plate count on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb agar). results: data from plate count showed the same overall trend of mtt assay. the latter showed that after 24 hours the effect of the tested toothpastes was significantly higher in reducing biofilm formation than after 72 hours. the toothpaste containing a high  concentration of amine fluoride (amf) had the highest performance in reducing biofilm formation. fluoride uptake of enamel showed a positive trend related to the fluoride concentration in both incubation times.

TI  == the oral commensal streptococcus mitis shows a mixed memory th cell signature that is similar to and cross-reactive with streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == background: carriage of and infection with streptococcus pneumoniae is known to predominantly induce t helper 17 (th17) responses in humans, but the types of th  cells showing reactivity towards commensal streptococci with low pathogenic potential, such as the oral commensals s. mitis and s. salivarius, remain uncharacterized. methods: memory cd4(+) t helper (th) cell subsets were isolated  from healthy human blood donors according to differential expression of chemokine receptors, expanded in vitro using polyclonal stimuli and characterized for reactivity against different streptococcal strains. results: th cells responding  to s. mitis, s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were predominantly in a ccr6(+)cxcr3(+) subset and produced ifn-gamma, and in a ccr6(+)ccr4(+) subset and produced il-17 and il-22. frequencies of s. pneumoniae-reactive th cells were higher than frequencies of s. mitis- and s. salivarius-specific th cells. s. mitis and s. pneumoniae isogenic capsule knock-out mutants and a s. mitis mutant  expressing the serotype 4 capsule of s. pneumoniae showed no different th cell responses as compared to wild type strains. s. mitis-specific th17 cells showed cross-reactivity with s. pneumoniae. conclusions: as th17 cells partly control clearance of s. pneumoniae, cross-reactive th17 cells that may be induced by commensal bacterial species may influence the immune response, independent of capsule expression.

TI  == parallel evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mitis to pathogenic and mutualistic lifestyles.
AB  == the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans. intriguingly, phylogenetic analysis shows that the species constitutes one evolutionary lineage in a cluster of the otherwise commensal streptococcus mitis strains, with which humans live in harmony. in a comparative analysis of 35 genomes, including phylogenetic analyses of all predicted genes, we have shown that the pathogenic pneumococcus has evolved into  a master of genomic flexibility while lineages that evolved into the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with their host by stabilizing an approximately 15%-reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. our data further provide evidence that interspecies gene transfer between s. pneumoniae and s. mitis occurs in a unidirectional manner, i.e., from s. mitis to s. pneumoniae. import of genes from s. mitis and other mitis, anginosus, and salivarius group streptococci ensured allelic replacements and antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae. our study explains how the unique structural diversity of the pneumococcal capsule emerged and conceivably will continue to increase and reveals a striking example of the fragile border between the commensal and pathogenic lifestyles. while genomic plasticity enabling quick adaptation to environmental stress is a necessity for the pathogenic streptococci, the commensal lifestyle benefits from stability. importance: one of the leading causes of fatal infections affecting humans, streptococcus pneumoniae, and the commensal streptococcus mitis are closely related obligate symbionts associated with hominids. faced with a shortage of accessible hosts, the two opposing lifestyles evolved in parallel. we have shown  that the nonpathogenic s. mitis secured harmonious coexistence with its host by stabilizing a reduced genome devoid of many virulence genes. meanwhile, the pathogenic pneumococcus evolved into a master of genomic flexibility and imports  genes from s. mitis and other related streptococci. this process ensured antigenic diversification and has been driving the evolution of the remarkable structural diversity of capsular polysaccharides of s. pneumoniae, which conceivably will continue to increase and present a challenge to disease prevention.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

TI  == phylogenomics and the dynamic genome evolution of the genus streptococcus.
AB  == the genus streptococcus comprises important pathogens that have a severe impact on human health and are responsible for substantial economic losses to agriculture. here, we utilize 46 streptococcus genome sequences (44 species), including eight species sequenced here, to provide the first genomic level insight into the evolutionary history and genetic basis underlying the functional diversity of all major groups of this genus. gene gain/loss analysis revealed a dynamic pattern of genome evolution characterized by an initial period of gene gain followed by a period of loss, as the major groups within the genus diversified. this was followed by a period of genome expansion associated with the origins of the present extant species. the pattern is concordant with an emerging view that genomes evolve through a dynamic process of expansion and streamlining. a large proportion of the pan-genome has experienced lateral gene transfer (lgt) with causative factors, such as relatedness and shared environment, operating over different evolutionary scales. multiple gene ontology terms were significantly enriched for each group, and mapping terms onto the phylogeny showed that those corresponding to genes born on branches leading to the major groups represented approximately one-fifth of those enriched. furthermore, despite the extensive lgt, several biochemical characteristics have  been retained since group formation, suggesting genomic cohesiveness through time, and that these characteristics may be fundamental to each group. for example, proteolysis: mitis group; urea metabolism: salivarius group; carbohydrate metabolism: pyogenic group; and transcription regulation: bovis group.

TI  == effective oral health in infective endocarditis: efficacy of high-street mouthwashes against the viridans group streptococci.
AB  == aim: recent uk national institute for health and clinical excellence guidelines state that there is no longer a need for oral antibiotic prophylaxis in patients  undergoing dental procedures who are at risk of infective endocarditis (ie), and  advocate the importance of maintaining good oral health. as viridans group streptococci (vgs) are common etiological agents of ie and inhabitants of the mouth, the purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of common high-street mouthwashes against four classes of vgs organisms (salivarius, mitis, anginosus, and mutans groupings). methods: the survival of vgs, streptococcus gordonii (national collection of type cultures [nctc] 7865), streptococcus intermedius (nctc 11324), streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), streptococcus oralis (nctc 11427), streptococcus pneumoniae (nctc 7465, nctc 7978, & american type culture collection 49619) and streptococcus salivarius (nctc 8618) was assessed in vitro following treatment of approximately 10(7) c.f.u. in planktonic state with four mouthwashes. results: no organisms were culturable following 1-min exposure, and were not recovered following non-selective enrichment following incubation in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with 0.8% (w/v) yeast extract. conclusions: these data indicate that such mouthwashes are able to completely kill vgs organisms tested in planktonic solution, where their use would promote good oral hygiene in patients at risk of ie.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == caries experience, mutans streptococci and total protein concentrations in children with protein-energy undernutrition.
AB  == background: the highest prevalence of protein-energy undernutrition is observed during early childhood, being also a time in which the presence of dental caries  can be unusually aggressive. the present study aimed to verify if different levels of undernutrition could influence the risk of early childhood caries (ecc), in the presence of other predisposing factors. methods: one hundred and twenty undernourished 12-70 month old children, with or without ecc, were selected. undernourished children were classified as being mildly, moderately or  severely undernourished. all children were examined for determination of decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs). total protein concentration in saliva was analysed by the bradford method. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. a binary logistic regression model was applied to test the simultaneous influence of different variables over caries experience. results: the risk of ecc was significantly higher with an increase in age (p = 0.000) and mutans streptococci counts (p = 0.032). comparisons with the  normal-weight group showed that mildly (p = 0.004) and severely undernourished children (p = 0.037) had a higher risk of experiencing ecc, but this risk was not significantly elevated among moderately undernourished children (p = 0.158). conclusions: our results suggest that mildly and severely undernourished children have an increased risk of experiencing dental caries. age is highly associated with the disease in this population.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == comparative genomics analysis of streptococcus isolates from the human small intestine reveals their adaptation to a highly dynamic ecosystem.
AB  == the human small-intestinal microbiota is characterised by relatively large and dynamic streptococcus populations. in this study, genome sequences of small-intestinal streptococci from s. mitis, s. bovis, and s. salivarius species-groups were determined and compared with those from 58 streptococcus strains in public databases. the streptococcus pangenome consists of 12,403 orthologous groups of which 574 are shared among all sequenced streptococci and are defined as the streptococcus core genome. genome mining of the small-intestinal streptococci focused on functions playing an important role in the interaction of these streptococci in the small-intestinal ecosystem, including natural competence and nutrient-transport and metabolism. analysis of the small-intestinal streptococcus genomes predicts a high capacity to synthesize amino acids and various vitamins as well as substantial divergence in their carbohydrate transport and metabolic capacities, which is in agreement with observed physiological differences between these streptococcus strains. gene-specific pcr-strategies enabled evaluation of conservation of streptococcus  populations in intestinal samples from different human individuals, revealing that the s. salivarius strains were frequently detected in the small-intestine microbiota, supporting the representative value of the genomes provided in this study. finally, the streptococcus genomes allow prediction of the effect of dietary substances on streptococcus population dynamics in the human small-intestine.

TI  == revealing anti-cariogenic efficacy of smokeless tobacco: a pilot study.
AB  == background: the tobacco plant, nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. however, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-columbian era. used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as  an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature.  aims and objectives: (1) to elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) to study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. materials and methods: extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. the extracts were placed in wells prepared on mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at  37 degrees c for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. the inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. results: smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against s. mutans. however,  the mean zones of inhibition were greater for ringer's lactate and tobacco group  as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. conclusion: the anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.

TI  == multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase causing excessive acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == ethanol consumption and poor oral hygiene are risk factors for oral and oesophageal cancers. although oral streptococci have been found to produce excessive acetaldehyde from ethanol, little is known about the mechanism by which this carcinogen is produced. by screening 52 strains of diverse oral streptococcal species, we identified streptococcus gordonii v2016 that produced the most acetaldehyde from ethanol. we then constructed gene deletion mutants in  this strain and analysed them for alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases by zymograms. the results showed that s. gordonii v2016 expressed three primary alcohol dehydrogenases, adha, adhb and adhe, which all oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde, but their preferred substrates were 1-propanol, 1-butanol and ethanol, respectively. two additional dehydrogenases, s-adha and tdha, were identified with specificities to the secondary alcohol 2-propanol and threonine,  respectively, but not to ethanol. s. gordonii v2016 did not show a detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase even though its adhe gene encodes a putative bifunctional acetaldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. mutants with adhe deletion showed greater tolerance to ethanol in comparison with the wild-type and mutant with adha or adhb deletion, indicating that adhe is the major alcohol dehydrogenase in s. gordonii. analysis of 19 additional strains of s. gordonii, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis showed expressions of up to three alcohol dehydrogenases, but none showed detectable acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, except one strain that showed a novel aldh. therefore, expression  of multiple alcohol dehydrogenases but no functional acetaldehyde dehydrogenase may contribute to excessive production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by certain oral streptococci.

TI  == inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  == background: tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. findings: this study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and  chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175,  streptococcus mutans atcc 35668, streptococcus mitis atcc 49456, streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 51655) to the hgf-1 gingival cell line. extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the streptococcus strains by up to 4 log cfu/well but effects of other teas and components were small. conclusions: pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.

TI  == colonization of streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  == introduction: self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. it is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of streptococcus mutans. the aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of s mutans. methods: the sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups  and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (quicklear; forestadent, pforzheim, germany; and in-ovation c; dentsply gac, bohemia, ny); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (damon 3; ormco, glendora, calif). the 2 control groups were conventional brackets (mystique; dentsply gac; and clarity; 3m unitek, monrovia, calif). the brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants.  biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in petri dishes containing mitis salivarius agar. the brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the tukey correction  with a p value of 0.05 were used. results: the greatest numbers of colonies were  found in an active self-ligating bracket group (in-ovation c), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (clarity). the largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. in the slot, the greatest formation was  in a control group (mystique). conclusions: self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser s mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == enantiomeric hplc resolution and absolute stereochemistry assignment of a new poligamain derivative.
AB  == a new aryltetralin lignan derivative, 1, was obtained by reacting dimethyl succinate and piperonal, furnishing the lactone 4-(3',4'-methylenedioxybenzyl)-4,5-dihydro-2(3h)-furanone, which was reacted once again with piperonal and lda to give the dibenzylbutirolactone 7-hydroxyhinokinin. the cyclization of 7-hydroxyhinokinin into polygamain occurred in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. the reduction of the furanic ring of polygamain was done by its reaction with dibal in thf, furnishing the diol functionalized lignin derivative 1 as single diastereomer. the enantiomeric  fractions of 1 were obtained by preparative enantioselective hplc. the absolute stereochemistry was assigned by electronic circular dichroism (ecd) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. an all-trans relative configuration was determined by nmr on the bases of (1)h coupling constants and nuclear overhauser  effect (n.o.e.) experiments. the absolute configuration at c1 was assigned on the basis of the ecd sign at 296 nm by comparison to the ecd spectra of structural analogues with defined stereochemistry. the assignment of the absolute configuration was confirmed by applying the exciton chirality method to the well-defined ecd couplets at 285 and 200 nm allied to the two electronic transitions l(b) and b(b) of the aromatic moieties, respectively. rac-1 and its enantiomeric isomers were evaluated against important bacteria responsible for dental caries. the best results obtained for the (1r,2s,3s) isomer were against streptococcus mutans (250 mum), streptococcus salivarius (250 mum), streptococcus sobrinus (280 mum) and streptococcus mitis (280 mum). the (1s,2r,3r) isomer was active only against streptococcus sanguinis (280 mum). the enantiomeric mixture was less active than the (1r,2s,3s) isomer.

TI  == comparative study on the microbial adhesion to preveneered and stainless steel crowns.
AB  == context: the extensive plaque formation on dental restorations may contribute to  secondary caries or periodontal inflammation. therefore, it is important to know  how different types of dental restorations may prevent or promote the accumulation of microorganisms. aims: the aim of this in vivo study was to evaluate the adhesion of streptococcus mutans to preveneered and stainless steel  crowns (sscs) and to evaluate the effects of these restorations on the gingival health and oral hygiene. materials and methods: twenty patients (age 3-5 years) were selected from the outpatient clinic of the pedodontics department, faculty of oral and dental medicine, cairo university. the selected patients had (dmf) index for primary dentition </=4, including lower right and left first primary molars. each tooth was pulpotomy-treated and restored with either type of crowns  (split-mouth technique). then, ten swabs from the buccal mucosa, preveneered crown, and ssc surfaces were taken from each patient. also, the gingival index (gi) and oral hygiene index (ohi-s) were measured at different times during the study. mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba) was used as a selective medium for s. mutans growth. msba plates were taken in candle jar and incubated aerobically  in 37 degrees c for 48 h. finally, bacteria were counted and expressed in colony  forming unit (cfu). results: after 1, 2, and 4 weeks, mucosa and crown swabs of preveneered crown showed statistically significant higher mean cfu counts than ssc. through the whole study period, the two restorations revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean cfu counts. also, there was a statistically significant positive (direct) correlation between ohi-s, gi, and s. mutans counts on both restorations. conclusions: the adhesion of s. mutans to preveneered crowns was higher than to ssc. full mouth rehabilitation led to significant decrease in s. mutans count in the short term. an increase in s. mutans counts is associated with an increase in ohi-s and gi.

TI  == recovery of mutans streptococci on msb, sb-20 and sb-20m agar media.
AB  == objective: the recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. in this study, we compared  (i) the culture media sucrose-bacitracin agar (sb-20), modified sb-20 (sb-20m) and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. design:  samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on sb-20, sb-20m and msb, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees c for 72h. identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. the biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on sb-20 and sb-20m agar. comparing the media, sb-20 and sb-20m yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than msb in the identification of s. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of s. mutans (p>0.05). conclusion: there was no significant difference between sb-20 and sb-20m culture  media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of  sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. compared with msb, sb-20 and sb-20m allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of s. sobrinus.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with down syndrome.
AB  == objectives: although individuals with down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. the present study  aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). in both populations, the  number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated ph, flow rate and iga concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. method: saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6  and 18 years old. the salivary iga concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. results: down syndrome children  had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. similar numbers of lactobacilli and candida species were found in both groups. salivary flow rates were 36% lower in  down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). the salivary ph did not differ between down syndrome children and controls. the down syndrome children had an iga secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: in conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == a novel formulation effective in killing oral biofilm bacteria.
AB  == objective: to determine if a novel formulation is effective in killing oral biofilm streptococci in vitro and in vivo. methods: efficacy of 0.5% levulinic acid and 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) in killing streptococcus gordonii ch1, streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mitis nctc10712, streptococcus oralis ks32ar, streptococcus mutans bm71, and streptococcus mutans gs5 in their biofilm form was measured in vitro, using microtiter plates and subsequent counts on mitis-salivarius agar plates. the safety and efficacy in vivo were evaluated using a mouse model. results: our anti-microbial formulation completely eliminated all the biofilm streptococcal species tested within 30 seconds (a reduction of 10(7) cfu/ml), whereas the positive control listerine only demonstrated moderate reduction in vitro. application of the formulation twice a  day for 7 days in the murine oral cavity resulted in significantly more reduction of established s. gordonii dl1 oral biofilm bacteria than listerine. the formulation did not cause any adverse effect in the murine oral cavity within a 2-week period. conclusions: we have demonstrated that the novel mouth rinse exhibits high efficacy in killing oral bacteria in their biofilm forms, results in no adverse effect in vivo, and contains alcohol-free components.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov., from the chimpanzee oral cavity.
AB  == six strains, tku 25, tku 28, tku 30, tku 31(t), tku 33 and tku 34, were isolated  from the oral cavity of a chimpanzee (pan troglodytes). colonies of strains grown on mitis-salivarius agar were similar in morphology to that of streptococcus mutans. the novel strains were gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic cocci that lacked catalase activity. analysis of the partial 16s rrna gene sequences of these isolates showed that the most closely related strain was the type strain of s. mutans (96.4 %). the next closely related strains to the isolates were the type strains of streptococcus devriesei (94.5 %) and streptococcus downei (93.9 %). these isolates could be distinguished from s. mutans by inulin fermentation and alkaline phosphatase activity (api zym system). the peptidoglycan type of the novel isolates was glu-lys-ala(3). strains were not susceptible to bacitracin. on the basis of phenotypic characterization, partial 16s rrna gene and two housekeeping gene (groel and soda) sequence data, we propose a novel taxon, streptococcus troglodytae sp. nov.; the type strain is tku 31(t) ( = jcm 18038(t) = dsm 25324(t)).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride in different concentrations.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of silver diamine fluoride - sdf -(cariestop), at commercial concentrations of 12% and 30%, was evaluated against clinical and pattern strains (atcc 25175) of s. mutans. clinical isolates were obtained from the saliva of six children attending the pediatric dentistry clinic ufpb, being grouped as follows: gi- low risk and caries activity, gii- high risk and caries activity. once sown, the strains were isolated from mitis-salivarius agar and divided into seven groups - m1 (pattern strain) to m7. the antibacterial activity was determined by maximum inhibitory dilution (mid) by the agar diffusion method, using serial dilutions (1:1 to 1:32) and the pure formulations of sdf and chlorhexidine 0.12% (positive control). after incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. the bactericidal and bacteriostatic actions of pure substances and in their respective mids were evaluated by test of germicidal power using glass specimens, after inoculation by the strains and incubation for 24 hours in bhi broth. each specimen was exposed to chlorhexidine and to sdf for 30s, 3min, 30min and 1h, then incubated for 24 h in bhi broth. the samples were subcultured in mitis-salivarius agar to evaluate the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of  the substances. the data were analyzed in a comparative-descriptive method. the cariestop 30% was effective until the last dilution (1:32) on all strains. for cariestop 12%, the mids corresponded to last dilution (1:32) in almost all samples, except for m3 (1:8). chlorhexidine showed dim in the last concentrations (1:32) on five samples, and in the concentration 1:8 for m3 and m7. as evidence of the germicidal power the substances had bactericidal activity at all times analyzed. it was concluded that the cariostatic showed antibacterial activity when compared to chlorhexidine and these two substances presented bactericidal action against the strains at all contact times.

TI  == anticariogenic potentials of clove, tobacco and bitter kola.
AB  == objective: to investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [syzygium  aromaticum (s. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [garcinia kola (g. kola)] and tobacco leaves (nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for  the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). methods: thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. these samples were collected from two major dental clinics in nsukka, enugu state, nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and mueller hinton agar (mha) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as above. the isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. the plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum cidal concentration (mcc) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. antibiotic  sensitivity test was also carried out. the results were statistically analyzed. results: the extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. the microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of s. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be staphylococcus spp. the gram reaction confirmed 13 gram-negative and 18 gram-positive organisms. the n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. mic showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. the antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. conclusions: since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (s. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.

TI  == molecular characterisation of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr)  of the parc gene locus in viridans-group streptococci.
AB  == forty-eight isolates of viridans-group streptococci (vgs) from adults and children in the community are examined for their resistance to ciprofloxacin phenotypically by determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). in addition, the parc gene locus is amplified and sequenced in all isolates and mutations noted. overall, 44 vgs organisms were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin by the broth microdilution method, and the remaining four strains had intermediate susceptibility. reduced mics were observed with intermediate strains when reserpine was added to the broth, inhibiting any efflux activity. overall, the effect of adding reserpine to the broth medium was to add one doubling dilution to the mic in the case of streptococcus mitis, s. oralis and s. salivarius, as well as to increase the mic by two doubling dilutions in two of the three s. parasanguinis isolates. amino acid sequence analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining region (qrdr) of the parc gene locus showed good correlation to the phenotypic resistance to ciprofloxacin, where no confirmed mutation conferring quinolone resistance was found. eleven amino acid positions showed discordance with s. pneumoniae r6 and eight (s52, f55, s58, n91, e135, k137, f141 and s167) were common in the vgs species examined. in addition, minor  substitutions were found at three positions (d51, t54 and v86). in conclusion, this study demonstrates the low occurrence of ciprofloxacin resistance in a population of vgs isolated from the community. in addition, several silent mutations were noted in vgs organisms without any increase in mic against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == establishment of streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  == objective: for paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. conventionally, the number and/or proportions of streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with s. mutans. thus, we searched for  an indicator for the establishment of s. mutans. methods: to evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of s. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, mitis-salivarius agar, and mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. results: two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of s. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. this suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was  revealed that the establishment of 10(3) cfu/ml of mutans streptococci in saliva  might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. conclusion: decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of s. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with s. mutans.

TI  == skin prick test with self-saliva in patients with oral aphthoses: a diagnostic pathergy for behcet's disease and recurrent aphthosis.
AB  == there may be some difficulties to differentiate behcet's disease (bd), recurrent  aphthosis (ra), and herpetic aphthous ulceration, from other mimicking oral disorders. despite of unexpected sensitivity and responsiveness, the skin pathergy test regarding a non specific hypersensitivity has long been thought as  one of auxiliary diagnostic benefits for bd. to determine the potential usefulness and disease specificity of the prick reaction with saliva, a skin prick test with neat and filter-sterilized saliva was performed on the forearm skin of 26 individuals; 10 patients with bd (8 incomplete type without uveitis, 1 complete type, and 1 neurological type), 5 with ra, 3 with herpetic oral aphthosis, 2 with erythema nodosum alone, and 6 healthy controls. we assessed the skin reaction at 48 hours after pricking, and the pricked skin lesions were biopsied and analyzed immunohistologically. nine of 10 bd patients (90 %) exhibited an indurative erythema at the skin site pricked with self-saliva, whereas 3 of 5 ra patients (60%) were relatively weak reaction. pricking with filter-sterilized saliva failed to recapitulate any of positive skin reactions, albeit a faint erythematous dot appeared in a few bd patients, implicating the involvement of causative microorganism(s) in oral bacterial flora. culture of saliva from 3 randomly chosen bd patients revealed numerous streptococcal colonies on mitis-salivarius agar. histology of the pricked skin sites showed perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, composed of cd4+ t cells and cd68+ monocyte/macrophage lineage, a feature consistent with a delayed type hypersensitive reaction. our results suggested that skin prick test using self-saliva (a new diagnostic pathergy) can be a simple and valuable in vivo diagnostic approach for differentiating bd and ra from other mimicking mucocutaneous diseases. the positive skin prick may be triggered by resident intra-oral microflora, particularly streptococci, and may in part address the underlying immunopathology in bd.

TI  == antibacterial activity of 15-deoxygoyazensolide isolated from the stems of minasia alpestris (asteraceae) against oral pathogens.
AB  == this work reports the isolation of the sesquiterpene lactone 15-deoxygoyazensolide from the stems of minasia alpestris and the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity against the following oral pathogens: enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. despite the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of other sesquiterpene lactones of the furanoheliangolide-type, our results revealed that this compound exhibits low antibacterial activity against the evaluated oral pathogens; however, an interesting selectivity against e. faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]=40 microg ml(-1)) and s. sobrinus (mic=60 microg ml(-1)) was observed.

TI  == salivaricin 9, a new lantibiotic produced by streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == salivaricin 9 (sal9) is a 2560 da lantibiotic having just 46 % amino acid identity with its closest known homologue, the streptococcus pyogenes lantibiotic sa-ff22. the sal9 locus (designated siv) in streptococcus salivarius strain 9 was partially sequenced and localized to an approximately 170 kb megaplasmid, which also harbours the locus for the lantibiotic salivaricin a4. the entire locus was  fully characterized in the draft genome sequence of s. salivarius strain jim8780  and shown to consist of eight genes, having the following putative functions: sivk, sensor kinase; sivr, response regulator; siva, sal9 precursor peptide; sivm, lantibiotic modification enzyme; sivt, abc transporter involved in the export of sal9 and concomitant cleavage of its leader peptide; and sivfeg, encoding lantibiotic self-immunity. intriguingly, in contrast to strain 9, the siv locus was chromosomally located in strain jim8780--the first lantibiotic locus shown not to be exclusively plasmid-associated in s. salivarius. sal9-containing extracts specifically induced lantibiotic production in both strain 9 and strain jim8780, indicating that sal9 functions as a signal peptide for upregulation of its own biosynthesis. screening representative strains of three streptococcal species (s. salivarius, s. pyogenes and s. mitis) for siva indicated that it was present only in s. salivarius, with 12 of 28 tested s. salivarius positive. since sal9 was inhibitory to all tested s. pyogenes strains  it appears to have potential as an important component of the bacteriocin armoury of s. salivarius probiotics intended to control s. pyogenes infections of the human oral cavity.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria by 16s rrna gene analysis in elderly persons requiring nursing care.
AB  == after incubation of saliva from 58 semi-bedridden elderly persons, the cultures were identified based on the 16s rrna gene base sequence to compare the identification by the conventional culture method. as a result, the 16s rrna gene base sequence of 198 strains identified by the culture method showed 98.5% or more homology in some of the human oral microbiome database, and the identification of bacterial species and genus was possible. when an organism identified by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method was compared with that by the culture method, the concordance rates were 54.5% at the genus level and 35.9% at  the species level. streptococcus mitis strains most frequently isolated from saliva that were identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method (32/35), and all the 11 streptococcus salivarius strains identified by the culture method were identified as the same species by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. all the strains identified as streptococcus anginosus group by the culture method and 8 of the 9  strains identified as prevotella species by the culture method were identified as the same group and genus by the 16s rrna gene sequencing method. when an oral microbial flora test with saliva samples from elderly persons is performed, the 16s rrna gene sequence identification enables us to identify major indigenous bacteria and pathogenic bacteria and is considered useful as a means of supplementing the conventional culture method.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

AB  == three gram-positive, catalase-negative, coccus-shaped organisms were isolated from the oral cavities of bears. the isolates were tentatively identified as a streptococcal species based on the results of biochemical tests. comparative 16s  rrna gene sequencing studies confirmed that the organisms were members of the genus streptococcus, but they did not correspond to any recognized species of the genus. the nearest phylogenetic relative of the new isolates was streptococcus ratti atcc 19645(t) (98.6 %), however, dna-dna hybridization analysis showed that the isolates displayed less than 15 % dna-dna relatedness with the type strain of s. ratti. colonies of the novel strains grown on mitis salivarius agar showed an  extracellular polysaccharide-producing colony morphology. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the novel isolates are classified in the genus streptococcus as streptococcus ursoris sp. nov. the type strain of s. ursoris is num 1615(t) (=jcm 16316(t)=dsm 22768(t)).

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

TI  == the effect of the surface roughness of porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans.
AB  == aim: dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. when a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque  and its components. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of  surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans. methods and materials: a total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. surface roughness values (ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. s. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb). bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. results: there was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (cfu x 10(3)).  the glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial  adhesion. conclusion: a positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of s. mutans adhesion was observed. the glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing.  clinical significance: chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal  surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. it is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.

TI  == horizontal transmission of mutans streptococci in children.
AB  == it has not been established whether transmission of mutans streptococci occurs between unrelated children older than 4 years of age. the aim of the study was to investigate the possible transmission of mutans streptococci genotypes from child to child in kindergarten. we studied 96 children (ages 5-6 yrs) in three san francisco bay area public schools. mutans streptococci colonies from each child were isolated from selective culture on mitis salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. we used arbitrary primed polymerase chain reactions to determine the mutans streptococci genotypes. two children (not siblings) in each of the three schools  (6%) shared an identical amplitype of s. mutans, unique to each pair. the 19 s. sobrinus amplitypes were found in 12 children, and all were unique to each child. the presence of matching genotypes of s. mutans demonstrates horizontal transmission of this species between unrelated children aged 5-6 years.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == antagonistic action of indigenous streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  == dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. if  microorganisms with antagonistic action on s. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. within the framework of the oral microbial ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify s. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon s. mutans. saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. they were incubated at 37 degrees c in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with s. mutans. antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. in children without and with caries, the frequency of s. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. in the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. in the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic  action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable  inhibitory action. to conclude, 112 s. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == oral streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  == background: despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. aim: the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children,  and age-matched full-term controls. design: plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12,  18, and 24 months. a quantitative real-time pcr technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. results: all species of streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. the relative ratios of the bacteria remained  fairly constant at all ages studied (p > 0.1). there were no significant differences in numbers of all streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. conclusion: the results  show that the relative numbers of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and s. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.

AB  == introduction: microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly  be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. the aim of this study was  to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. methods: cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with streptococcus sanguinis kth-4, streptococcus cristatus cc5a, streptococcus salivarius tove and streptococcus mitis bms before  aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. experiments were performed in a modified robbins-device-type flow cell. bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. results: the streptococci were able to inhibit a. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by s. sanguinis. conclusion: these data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial  bacteria in periodontal treatment.

TI  == frequency and distribution of mutans streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children.
AB  == mutans streptococci, in particular s. mutans and s. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. the frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. the samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in mitis salivarius (ms) agar for total streptococci determination and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) for isolation of mutans streptococci. the bacterial identification procedure was done using the api rapid strep system. the criteria used to determine dmft and dmft was established by klein and palmer (1941). mean dmft and dmft were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored  mutans streptococci. the species most frequently found were s. mutans (20%), s. sobrinus (10%) and s. rattus (3.3%). meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically s. mutans and s. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups.  these results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

AB  == objective: to determine the proportion of subjects with oropharyngeal streptococci resistant to either levofloxacin or azithromycin prior to and during antibacterial exposure, and to follow temporal changes in the proportion of resistant and susceptible isolates through 6 weeks post-exposure. this randomized, open-label, single-center study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: nct00821782). research design and methods: a total of 143 healthy volunteers (levofloxacin, n = 71; azithromycin, n = 72) without antibacterial exposure in the previous 90 days received either levofloxacin 750 mg once daily for 5 days or azithromycin 500 mg once daily on day 1 and 250 mg once daily on days 2 through 5. oropharyngeal cultures were obtained pre-exposure, at day 5, and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-dosing. bacterial strains were identified and the minimum inhibitory concentrations for levofloxacin and azithromycin were determined. results: at study entry 117 streptococci were isolated from 72 subjects randomized to azithromycin and 53 (45.3%) were azithromycin-resistant. none of the 121 streptococci isolated from 71 subjects randomized to.levofloxacin were colonized by a levofloxacin-resistant microorganism prior to dosing. at the  end of dosing, the number of subjects with resistant streptococci (s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, or alpha streptococcus species [spp.]) increased in azithromycin-exposed subjects and resistant isolates remained through 6 weeks post-dosing. in contrast, a small number of levofloxacin-resistant streptococci were observed at the end of dosing but decreased by week 2 post-dosing and continued to decrease through the 6-week evaluation period (p < 0.001 azithromycin vs. levofloxacin for s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis and alpha streptococcus spp. at week 6). limitations of this study included the fact that,  since previous antibiotic use was self-reported, genetic typing was not done. the results of this study may not be completely generalizable, because subjects in this study received study drug under directly-observed conditions, thus ensuring  compliance. conclusions: both antibacterial agents were well tolerated. levofloxacin 750 mg administered for 5 days was associated with less microbial resistance than that observed with azithromycin in healthy subjects.

AB  == nonhemolytic streptococci (nhs) cause serious infections, such as endocarditis and septicemia. many conventional phenotypic methods are insufficient for the identification of bacteria in this group to the species level. genetic analysis has revealed that single-gene analysis is insufficient for the identification of  all species in this group of bacteria. the aim of the present study was to establish a method based on sequence analysis of the 16s-23s intergenic spacer (its) region and the partial gdh gene to identify clinical relevant nhs to the species level. sequence analysis of the its region was performed with 57 nhs reference or clinical strains. satisfactory identification to the species level was achieved for 14/19 nhs species included in this study on the basis of sequence analysis of the its region. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis obtained the expected taxon as the best taxon match, but there was a short maximum score distance to the next best match (distance, <10). streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus pneumoniae could not be unambiguously discriminated by sequence analysis of the its region, as was also proven by phylogenetic analysis. these five species could be identified to the group level only by its sequence analysis. partial gdh sequence analysis was  applied to the 11 s. oralis strains, the 11 s. mitis strains, and the 17 s. pneumoniae strains. all except one strain achieved a satisfactory identification  to the species level. a phylogenetic algorithm based on the analysis of partial gdh gene sequences revealed three distinct clusters. we suggest that sequence analysis of the combination of the its region and the partial gdh gene can be used in the reference laboratory for the species-level identification of nhs.

AB  == background: population analysis of viridans streptococci is important because these species are associated with dental caries, bacteremia, and subacute endocarditis, in addition to being important members of the human oral commensal  microbiota. design: in this study, we phylogenetically analyzed the rod shape-determining protein gene (roda), which is associated with cellular morphology, cell division, and sensitivity for antibiotics, and demonstrated that the diversity of the roda gene is sufficient to identify viridans streptococci at the species level. moreover, we developed a more convenient denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) method based on the diversity of the roda gene (roda-dgge) for detecting nine dominant streptococcal species in human saliva, namely, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus vestibularis,  streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. results: this roda-dgge method proved useful in detecting viridans streptococci without cultivation, isolation, and phenotypic characterization. conclusion: analysis of the oral microbiota by roda-dgge offers a higher resolution than the  conventional dgge using 16s rdna and may be an alternative in the microbial diagnosis of streptococcal infection.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory iga (siga), ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci (ms) and candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: group i, children with rampant caries, group ii, caries-free children. the average salivary flow rate was measured from  the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the ph was determined using a ph-electrode. measurement of siga was performed using an immunoassay kit. the levels of ms and candida were determined by culture on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. it was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary siga, ms and candida. however, the mean values for salivary flow rates and ph were similar between the groups. the results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of siga, ms and candida in their oral cavities. this  finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary siga may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.

TI  == sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine effect in the inhibition of mutans streptococci in children with dental caries: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
AB  == objective: we aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. methods: thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at  least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. a gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. salivary ms levels were measured at baseline (d1) and on the 6th (d6), 15th (d15), and 30th (d30) days. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. results: difference between treatments was only verified on d6. on the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (p = 0.0000). the use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary ms levels throughout the duration of the study. following treatment, a subsequent increase in ms counts between d6 and d15 (p = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. conclusion: a 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary ms; there was a significant ms increase once treatment was suspended. the use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen  was not able to reduce salivary ms levels. our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary ms levels in children with dental caries.

TI  == bacteriocins in s. mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental  caries: biotypes and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the production of bacteriocins in the streptococcus mutans strains isolated from children with and without dental caries. with this purpose the dmft index was determined and non-stimulated saliva was collected from 53 3- to 5-year-old children. the samples were cultured on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated anaerobically for two days at 37 degrees c. the isolates were biotyped using the api-zym enzymatic system (biomerieux; marcy-le'toile, france). bacteriocin was detected using the double layer onto brain heart infusion agar technique and the minimal inhibitory concentrations of the isolates were evaluated against penicillin, amoxycillin, cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, imipenem and vancomycin using an agar dilution method. the dental caries experience in these children was 66% (35/53) and dmft index average was 3.2 (range 2-6). s. mutans was found in the saliva of  33 children (62%). in the 33 strains of s. mutans, 10 biotypes were found. eight  (24%) of the 33 strains evaluated produced bacteriocins, 6 of these strains came  from patients with dental caries and the other two from patients without dental caries. all isolates were highly sensitive to the antibiotics tested.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine mouth rinse on streptococci counts of tooth-tissue-borne  palatal expander biofilm.
AB  == objectives: to assess total streptococci (ts) counts and biofilm mass over tooth-tissue-borne palatal expander (ttbpe), as well as the effect of chlorhexidine (chx) mouth rinse on these variables. design: a cross-sectional study design employed clinical procedures and laboratorial techniques. setting and sample population: patients who had ttbpe removal indicated were divided into two groups: a chx group (n = 26) in which three times a day of 0.2% chx digluconate mouth rinses were prescribed 7 days before ttbpe removal; and a control (con) group (n = 25) in which no antimicrobial treatment was applied. experimental variable: 'gender', 'age', and 'ttbpe wear time' were recorded. after ttbpe removal, biofilm mass was determined by the difference between (ttbpe + biofilm) and (ttbpe only) masses. ts counts were determined by biofilm suspension followed by progressive dilutions and culture on mitis salivarius agar with incubation at 37 degrees c for 72 h. outcome measure: biofilm mass (mg) and  colony forming units of ts / mg of biofilm (cfu-ts / mg) were calculated. results - total streptococci mean values in chx (6.77 x 10(6)cfu-ts / mg) were statistically lower (p < 0.01) than those in con (3.82 x 10(7)cfu-ts / mg), but there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between chx (168.88 mg) and con (182.04 mg) masses nor statistical correlation (p > 0.05) between biofilm mass and cfu-ts / mg in the two groups. conclusion: chlorhexidine reduces the ts counts in ttbpe, but has no effect on biofilm mass.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == colonization of mutans streptococci in costa rican children from a high-risk population.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the study was to determine the colonization of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental biofilm and saliva of children from a high-risk population with low socioeconomic status from san jose, costa rica. methods: a total of 68 healthy babies from 8 to 20 months of age (mean age=13 months), with  caries-free status and cariogenic feeding habits (eg, nursing bottle- or breast-feeding on demand) were examined. children divided in two groups (<13 months and 14-20 months). samples from dental biofilm and saliva from each subject were processed and plated in blood agar (ba) and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb) to determine ms percentage. statistical analysis included the analysis of variance test, and stratification by age of ms  levels. results: detectable ms levels in dental biofilm and saliva were found in  75% and 72% of children, respectively. counts higher than 20000 colony forming units (cfu) per ml were found in 4% of saliva and in 35% of biofilm samples. the  two groups showed significant differences in ms levels for dental biofilm (p=.036) and saliva (p=.009). children older than 17 months presented higher ms levels (p<.05). analysis by ms levels (<0.1%; 0.1-1.0%;>1.0% of ms) the two groups showed an insignificant association with increasing mean age. ms density was associated with mean number of erupted primary molars. conclusions: mutans streptococci colonization of dental biofilm and saliva from high caries risk infants is associated with age and dental development.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == new serotype of mutans streptococci isolated from pig oral cavity.
AB  == gram-positive streptococcal mutans-like strains, but with clearly different colony formation than s. orisuis on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from the pig oral cavity and identified by 16s rrna sequencing, g+c content, dna-dna homology and extensive biochemical and serological testing. the phenotypic data showed that the strains were similar to s. orisuis except for susceptibility to bacitracin. dna-dna homology between the isolates and s. orisuis was 72~81%. however, serological data showed that they have a different sero-specific antigen from s. orisuis and other mutans streptococci. a new serotype, designated p, strains are classified in a serovar of s. orisuis, one of mutans streptococci.

TI  == heritability of oral microbial species in caries-active and caries-free twins.
AB  == oral microbes that colonize in the mouths of humans contribute to disease susceptibility, but it is unclear if host genetic factors mediate colonization. we therefore tested the hypothesis that the levels at which oral microbes colonize in the mouth are heritable. dental plaque biofilms were sampled from intact tooth surfaces of 118 caries-free twins. an additional 86 caries-active twins were sampled for plaque from carious lesions and intact tooth surfaces. using a reverse capture checkerboard assay the relative abundance of 82 bacterial species was determined. an integrative computational predictive model determined  microbial abundance patterns of microbial species in caries-free twins as compared to caries-active twins. heritability estimates were calculated for the relative microbial abundance levels of the microbial species in both groups. the  levels of 10 species were significantly different in healthy individuals than in  caries-active individuals, including, a. defectiva, s. parasanguinis, s. mitis/oralis, s. sanguinis, s. cristatus, s. salivarius, streptococcus sp. clone  ch016, g. morbillorum and g. haemolysans. moderate to high heritability estimates were found for these species (h(2) = 56%-80%, p < .0001). similarity of the overall oral microbial flora was also evident in caries-free twins from multivariate distance matrix regression analysis. it appears that genetic and/or  familial factors significantly contribute to the colonization of oral beneficial  species in twins.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in koreans.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from koreans. the dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7  years). the samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x pbs and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the mutans streptococci grown on msb plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dextranase gene (dex). the mutans streptococci  were identified at the species level using a 16s rdna sequencing comparison method. the biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. the biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes i, ii, iv,  v and variant, respectively. of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype iv except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis  test. we considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype vii. in conclusion, s. mutans and its biotype i was most frequently isolated in korean dental plaque. the mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.

AB  == a total of 270 viridans group streptococci (vs) isolated from healthy children, identified to the species level, were tested for their susceptibilities to penicillin, imipenem, erythromycin, and vancomycin. a total of 270 isolates and 1,080 organism-antibiotic combinations were evaluated. the overall susceptibility rates of all isolates obtained by the etest (et) versus agar dilution (ad) were 60.4% versus 61.8% for penicillin, 63.8% versus 63.9% for erythromycin, 90.6% versus 96% for vancomycin, and 99.1% versus 96.0% for imipenem, respectively. major discrepancies occurred in the testing of the susceptibility of streptococcus mutans to vancomycin, with 59.5% (et) versus 100% (ad), followed by s. salivarius, with 84.1% versus 100%; s. oralis, with 82.1% versus 96.4%; and s. mitis, with 90% versus 100%, respectively. there were also differences in the rates of susceptibility of s. mutans, 66.5% (et) versus 85.1% (ad), and s. intermedius, 82.9% versus 72.1%, respectively, to penicillin. general agreement between the results of et and ad was obtained for 973 organism-antibiotic combinations out of 1,080 antibiotic combinations, i.e., 90.1%. very major errors were found for 6.8% of isolates, and major errors were found for 3.2% of isolates; the minor errors were negligible. agreement between the results of the  two methods was 98.7% for penicillin, 94.6% for vancomycin, 96.9% for imipenem, and 99.9% for erythromycin. the highest rate of very major errors was for vancomycin, at 5.4%. the et appears to be as efficient as ad for susceptibility testing of vs, except for vancomycin, where very major errors in the results were relatively high.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of garlic against oral streptococci.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of two garlic clones' (1: purple and 2: white) crude extracts against oral microbiota was evaluated in vitro (study 1) and in vivo (study 2). study 1 consisted of the evaluation of minimum inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentrations against nine streptococci strains. in study 2,  a 2.5% garlic (clone 2) solution was used as a mouthwash in a 5-week study by 30  subjects. blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar were inoculated with subjects' saliva to quantify oral microorganisms and mutans streptococci. study 1 showed mic ranging from 0.5 to 32.0 mg ml(-1) for clone 2 and from 8 to 64.0 mg ml(-1) for clone 1. mbc ranged from 1.0 to 128.0 mg ml(-1) and from 8.0 to 128.0  mg ml(-1) regarding clones 2 and 1 respectively. study 2 showed that 2.5% garlic  mouthwash solution had good antimicrobial activity against mutans streptococci and oral microorganisms. maintenance of reduced salivary levels of streptococci was observed after 2 weeks at the end of mouthwash use. unpleasant taste (100%),  halitosis (90%) and nausea (30%) were reported by subjects after the end of the study. it was concluded that the garlic clones have antimicrobial properties in vitro against streptococci and anticariogenic properties against oral microorganism in spite of its adverse effects.

TI  == evaluation of piper cubeba extract, (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == the activities of the crude ethanol extract from piper cubeba seeds, (-)-cubebin  and its semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated against oral pathogens. the crude ethanol extract was more active against streptococcus salivarius (mic value of 80 microg/ml). (-)-cubebin displayed mic values ranging from 0.20 mm for streptococcus mitis to 0.35 mm for enterococcus faecalis. the natural product (-)-cubebin and its semi-synthetic derivative (-)-hinokinin displayed bacteriostatic activity at all evaluated concentrations, as well as fungicidal activity against candida albicans at 0.28 mm. the o-benzyl cubebin derivative showed fungistatic and fungicidal effects against c. albicans at 0.28 mm and 0.35 mm, respectively. also, the other dibenzylbutyrolactone derivatives [(-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin and (-)-o-(n,n-dimethylaminoethyl)-cubebin] displayed  bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects at the evaluated concentrations. moreover, the semi-synthetic derivative (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin was the most active compound against all the evaluated microorganisms. therefore, it may be suggested that the presence of the carbonyl group at c-9 plus the introduction of polar groups in the aromatic rings improve the antimicrobial activity of dibenzylbutyrolactone compounds.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of resin and resin-modified dental cements.
AB  == objective: cements possessing antibacterial properties may reduce bacteria-induced fixed partial denture complications. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 dental cements using the direct contact test (dct) and the agar diffusion test (adt). method and materials: the adt was performed using mitis salivarius agar plates. each plate was evenly inoculated with freshly grown mutans streptococci. two samples of each test material-relyx arc, variolink ii, gc fujicem, and principle-were placed, and the  inhibition halo obtained was measured after 48 hours. for the dct, 8 samples were placed on the sidewalls of wells in a 96-well microtiter plate. after polymerization, freshly grown streptococcus mutans cells (1 x 10(6)) were placed  on the surface of each sample for 1 hour at 37 degrees c. fresh medium was then added to each well, and bacterial growth was followed for 16 hours in a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer. similarly prepared samples were aged in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 or 7 days and the dct was repeated. analysis of variance (anova) and tukey multiple comparisons were applied to the data. results: in the adt, gc fujicem showed an inhibition zone of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mm, and  principle showed an inhibition zone of 1.2 +/- 0.2 mm. in the dct, freshly polymerized samples of gc fujicem and principle exhibited potent antibacterial properties, while samples of variolink ii and relyx arc showed moderate antibacterial properties. principle showed some antibacterial properties even after 1 day (p < .001). conclusion: none of the tested cements in this study possesses long-term antibacterial properties.

TI  == identification of alpha-hemolytic streptococci by pyrosequencing the 16s rrna gene and by use of vitek 2.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci are very difficult to identify by phenotypic methods. in this study, a pyrosequencing method for the identification of streptococcal species based on two variable regions of the 16s rrna gene is described. almost all studied streptococcal species (n = 51) represented by their type strains could be differentiated except for some closely related species of the streptococcus bovis or s. salivarius group. the pyrosequencing results of alpha-hemolytic streptococci isolated from blood (n = 99) or from the normal pharyngeal microbiota (n = 25) were compared to the results obtained by the vitek 2 with gp card (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france). as expected, the results of  the two methods did not completely agree, but 93 (75.0%) of the isolates assigned to the same streptococcal group by both methods and 57 (46.0%) reached consistent results at the species level. however, 10 strains remained unidentified by vitek  2, and 4 isolates could not be assigned to any streptococcal group by pyrosequencing. identification of members of the s. mitis and s. sanguinis groups proved difficult for both methods. furthermore, the pyrosequencing analysis revealed great sequence variation, since only 43 (32.3%) of the 133 isolates analyzed by pyrosequencing had sequences identical to a type strain. the variation was greatest in the pharyngeal isolates, slightly lower in the blood culture isolates, and nonexistent in invasive pneumococcal isolates (n = 17) that all had the s. pneumoniae type strain sequence. the resolution of the results obtained by the two methods is impeded by the lack of a proper gold standard.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (ch) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (ipc). methods: twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. the treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a ch or gutta-percha (gp) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. after cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar and rogosa sl agar. results: 39 teeth (20 in the ch group and 19 in the gp group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. in the ch group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the gp group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (group ch) and 84.2% (group gp) were dark brown. the final consistency was either leathery or hard. three samples in the ch group and five in group gp changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (gp) remained leathery. 85% in the ch group and 68.4% in gp group turned hard after treatment.  all bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. in the ch group, the bacterial (log10 cfu + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. in gp group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.

TI  == comparative analysis of a monoclonal antibody-based streptococcus mutans detection method with selective culture assays using polymerase chain reaction as a gold standard.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mab)-based salivary streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as the gold standard. salivary s. mutans cells were enumerated with a mab-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (tycsb), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) agar. statistical analysis  showed no significant correlations between each method. with pcr as the standard, a mab-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. this study demonstrates that the  mab-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary s. mutans than selective media.

TI  == a modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  == this study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. one hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. dft (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. the group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower dft score (p < 0.001) than  the other group. using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying s. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was 16.5  (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. children carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. these results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == acetaldehyde production from ethanol by oral streptococci.
AB  == alcohol is a well documented risk factor for upper digestive tract cancers. it has been shown that acetaldehyde, the first metabolite of ethanol is carcinogenic. the role of microbes in the production of acetaldehyde to the oral  cavity has previously been described in several studies. in the present study, the aim was to investigate the capability of viridans group streptococci of normal oral flora to produce acetaldehyde in vitro during ethanol incubation. furthermore, the aim was to measure the alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) activity of the bacteria. eight clinical strains and eight american type culture collection (atcc) strains of viridans group streptococci were selected for the study. bacterial suspensions were incubated in two different ethanol concentrations, 11  mm and 1100 mm and the acetaldehyde was measured by gas chromatography. adh-activity was measured by using a sensitive spectroscopy. the results show significant differences between the bacterial strains regarding acetaldehyde production capability and the detected adh-activity. in particular, clinical strain of streptococcus salivarius, both clinical and culture collection strains  of streptococcus intermedius and culture collection strain of streptococcus mitis produced high amounts of acetaldehyde in 11 mm and 1100 mm ethanol incubation. all these four bacterial strains also showed significant adh-enzyme activity. twelve other strains were found to be low acetaldehyde producers. consequently, our study shows that viridans group streptococci may play a role in metabolizing  ethanol to carcinogenic acetaldehyde in the mouth. the observation supports the concept of a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of oral cancer.

TI  == unusual asymptomatic giant sialolith of the submandibular gland: a clinical report.
AB  == this report presents an unusual case of asymptomatic sialolith of the submandibular gland. a 61-year-old man was referred to our department for multiple extractions. an ortopantomographic exam revealed the existence of a large radiopacity in the right premolar mandibular region. the patient was completely asymptomatic and no episodes of pain and swelling had occurred in the  previous years. ultrasonography and clinical examination confirmed the diagnosis  of sialolithiasis of the submandibular duct. the calculus was removed trans-orally in local anaesthesia. the sialolith measured 22 mm and it was mainly constituted by phosphate, calcium and smaller amounts of magnesium. the bacteriological exam revealed the presence of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus  salivarius and non-pathogenic neisserie. postoperative course was uneventful. even a sialolith of significant dimensions may not be symptomatic. nevertheless,  the likelihood of future complications may constitute an indication for surgical  removal of abnormal asymptomatic sialoliths.

TI  == comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.
AB  == aim: this study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (ms) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. methods and results: when pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agar and the modified medium of ritz  (hlr-s). one species of ms, streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on msb medium. chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. on the glass adherence assay (mucount), s. ferus was not detected and streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (cariescreen sm) or on the plastic adherence assay (dentocult sm strip mutans). the frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than ms was common. from saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of ms on hlr-s and tycsb media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. the frequency of isolation on msb medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended  to be highest on the hlr-s medium and on the glass adherence assay. conclusions:  growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the ms varied according to different media. significance and impact of the study: caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for ms enumeration.

AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == early acquisition of streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  == existing evidence reveals that in early oral infection the main route of transmission of streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "window of infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life,  with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. the aim of the present study  was to analyze early oral infection. the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the university hospital of maternity and neonatology of cordoba participated in the study. samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective agar mitis salivarius bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c and in 5% co2 to allow for the growth of streptococcus mutans. the colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. at 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. at 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. the initial acquisition of streptococcus mutans would  have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.

TI  == viridans streptococci isolated by culture from blood of cancer patients: clinical and microbiologic analysis of 50 cases.
AB  == clinical and microbiologic studies of 50 cases of viridans streptococcal bacteremia in cancer patients were performed. the bacteria were identified to species level by sequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. at least nine streptococcus spp. were found, including s. mitis (25 strains, 50.0% of 50); currently unnamed streptococcus spp. (11 strains); s. parasanguis (five strains); s. anginosus (three strains); s. salivarius (two strains); and one strain each of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, and s. vestibularis. there were no s. oralis strains. among 11 antibiotics of nine classes tested, no resistance to vancomycin, linezolid, or quinupristin-dalfopristin was seen. resistance to penicillin (mic, 4 to 12 mug/ml) was noted only among s. mitis strains (28.0%, 7/25) and not non-s. mitis strains (0/25) (p = 0.004). significantly more s. mitis strains than non-s. mitis strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones and to > or =3 classes of antibiotics. isolation of quinolone-resistant organisms was associated with the prior usage of quinolones (p = 0.002). quantitative blood cultures showed that the strains resistant to levofloxacin or gatifloxacin were associated with higher colony counts than were their corresponding nonresistant strains. the young and elderly patients also had higher levels of bacteremia caused predominantly by s. mitis. septic shock was present in 17 (34.0% of 50) patients, and 13 of those cases were caused by s. mitis (p = 0.007). these results suggest that s. mitis is the most common cause of viridans streptococcal  bacteremia in cancer patients and is more resistant to antibiotics than other species.

AB  == background and objective: dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. mastic gum, from pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against s. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. setting: cukurova university, dental school, in 2002. materials  and methods: antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard s. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on hep-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan  blue exclusion method. clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. the inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. the samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees c. the total number of viable bacteria was then counted. results: among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. in the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of hep-2 cells. thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. in vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. in the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65  x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared  to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). conclusions: this preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against s. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.

TI  == identification of 43 streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpb gene.
AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == cross-contamination of the psp sensor in a preclinical setting.
AB  == purpose: this study tested an infection control protocol for photostimulable phosphor (psp) sensors while simulating multiple uses. methods: dental hygiene students (n=36) were randomly assigned to a control group (dry wipe) or test group (disinfectant wipe). a sterile, barriered sensor was placed in a peer patient's mouth to simulate an exposure. after simulation, the barriered sensors  were disinfected, placed into a new barrier, and inserted into the same peer patient's mouth. following the fourth placement and treatment, sensors were vortexed in specimen cups containing trypticase soy broth (tsb) and incubated at  37 degrees c to detect contamination by oral bacteria. results: bacterial growth  in tsb was monitored as a change in optical density and by quantitation of oral streptococci on mitis-salivarius agar. the barrier-protected sensors were minimally contaminated (<10(5) colony forming units/ml at baseline) regardless of treatment. after culture amplification, the control tsb had more samples that remained negative through 48 hours (5/18 vs. 0/18 for test group, p<0.05). conclusion: barrier envelopes used with the psp sensors appeared to be an effective way of reducing microbial contamination.

TI  == molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  == the complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. however, studies  on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. to clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16s rdna sequences from the dna isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16s rdna libraries were constructed with the amplicons of pcr conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. nine independent libraries were produced  by the application of three sets of primers (set a, set b, and set c) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. the library clone with set a universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. thus, set a primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. on the first day of the life of the infant, enterobacter, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, and streptococcus mitis were present. the largest taxonomic group was l. lactis. on the third day of the  life of the infant, enterobacter, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, s. mitis, and streptococcus salivarius were present. on the sixth day of the life of the infant, citrobacter, clostridium difficile, enterobacter sp., enterobacter cloacae, and e. coli were present. the largest taxonomic group was e. coli. these results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after  the third day.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == first isolation of streptococcus downei from human dental plaques.
AB  == in this study, we isolated four bacterial strains grown on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. the strains had similar biochemical characteristics to biotypes i or ii of mutans streptococci. the four isolates were identified as streptococcus downei by 16s rdna and dextranase gene (dex) sequencing as well as  polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dex. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and identification of s. downei from dental plaque in humans. the results suggest that s. downei can inhabit the human oral cavity.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

AB  == the objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-mso) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) plates. the dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on msb.  the bacteria growing on the msb plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16s rdna cloning and sequencing techniques. our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the msb plates. among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-mso. these 12 colonies were determined to be streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), s. sanguinis (1 colony), and pantoea  agglomerans (3 colonies). these results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.

TI  == study of viridans streptococci and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate patients before and after surgery.
AB  == objective: to determine the effect of surgery on types and colony count of streptococcus and staphylococcus species in cleft lip and palate (clp) patients.  design: saliva samples were collected after the morning meal by placing a sterile cotton swab in the vestibule of the oral cavity from cleft lip and palate patients immediately preoperative and 12 weeks postoperative. normal children were examined as a control group. samples were cultured; staphylococcus and streptococcus isolates were identified and quantified. patients: fifteen cleft lip and palate patients and 22 normal children, aged 3 to 39 months were examined. results: streptococcus mitis biovar 1, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus oralis of the viridans group of streptococci were the most commonly found in normal children, as well as in cleft lip and palate children. in the cleft lip and palate group, mean streptococcal count was 32.41 (29.80) and 46.46  (42.80) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in the normal group, the count was 20.93 (27.93) and 49.92 (34.72) at 0 week and 12 weeks, respectively. staphylococcus aureus was the most common staphylococcus species found in clp patients, representing 47.4% postoperatively. in the cleft lip and palate children, mean staphylococcal count was 5.34 (8.13) and 0.56 (0.92) in the pre- and postoperative periods, respectively; in normal children, the count was 0.82 (1.98) and 0.60 (2.55) at 0 and 12 weeks, respectively. the differences were statistically significant only for the staphylococcal count between pre- and postoperative periods in children with cleft lip and palate as tested by analysis of variance (p < .05). conclusions: cleft lip and palate patients had more colonization by s. aureus compared with normal children, and the colony count decreased significantly following surgical repair of the cleft lip and palate.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

TI  == expression of the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus in streptococcus anginosus using integration-mediated transformation system.
AB  == we have constructed a streptococcus anginosus transformant expressing the gtfi gene from streptococcus sobrinus, using a previously developed integration-mediated transformation system to introduce foreign genes onto the oral streptococcal chromosome, and attempted to evaluate the gene expression. in  this system, one cloning plasmid and three pacyc184 derivatives, anchor, heterodimer, and integration plasmids were used for the construction of a series  of integrants via homologous recombination. a portion of s. sobrinus gtfi gene devoid of approximately 1 kb of the 5'-region derived from pmd39 was cloned into  the integration plasmid and introduced onto the s. anginosus chromosome. next, the polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to 2.0 kb of the 5'-region of the gtfi gene from s. sobrinus chromosome was further cloned into the cloning plasmid, and the intact gtfi gene was reconstructed following integration. the final s. anginosus integrant successfully secreted the enzymatically active gtfi  gene products and extracellular enzyme was characterized. this enzyme produced water-insoluble glucans and glucan-forming activity was stimulated by the addition of dextrant10. when this integrant was grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, the integrant adhered to the glass surface in vitro and this integrant exhibited the different colony morphology on mitis-salivarius  agar plates compared to s. sobrinus and s. anginosus. these observations strongly suggest that the construction of s. anginosus integrant expressing s. sobrinus gtfi gene using this transformation system may be an effective means of analysis  of cariogenic biofilm formation.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effect of antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions.
AB  == background: an antibacterial self-etching primer has been developed to inhibit bacterial attachment and plaque accumulation on the tooth surfaces. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth-inhibitory effect of an antibacterial self-etching primer on mutans streptococci obtained from arrested carious lesions. materials and methods: softened dentin specimens were obtained from arrested carious lesions with an excavator or a round steel bur. the effect of a  commercial antibacterial self-etching primer and a commercial self-etching primer on the total streptococci on mitis-salivarius (ms) agar plates and on streptococcus mutans on ms agar plates containing 0.02 m bacitracin (msb) was evaluated. specimens with no primer were used as controls. the number of colonies of both total streptococci and s. mutans were compared statistically with two-way analysis of variance and fisher's protected least squares differences (plsd) test (p < .05). results: the number of colonies of total streptococci (cfu/ml) for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 5.0 x 10(6); for the self-etching primer, 1.0 x 10(5) and 1.0 x 10(5); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. the number of colonies of s. mutans for the two methods (excavator and round steel bur) were as follows: for the control, 5.0 x 10(6) and 1.8 x 10(5); for the self-etching primer, 3.5 x 10(4) and 5.0 x 10(3); and for the antibacterial self-etching primer, 0 and 0. regardless of the method of softened dentin removal, the antibacterial effect was significantly higher for the group that had antibacterial self-etching primer compared with that of the control group and the group that had commercial self-etching primer (p < .05). clinical significance: the antibacterial self-etching primer showed a high level of antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci obtained from the arrested carious lesions.

TI  == [streptococcus salivarius meningitis after spinal anesthesia].
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is a usual commensal of skin, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, oral cavity and paranasal sinuses. although it is usually considered to have low virulence, s. salivarius may cause life-threatening infections, particularly endocarditis. on the other hand, bacterial meningitis after spinal anesthesia is very rare, there being some reported cases caused by s. salivarius, s. mitis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. we report a 57 year old man who developed meningitis symptoms within 10 h of an uncomplicated inguinal herniorrhaphy performed during spinal anesthesia. cerebrospinal cultures grew s. salivarius sensitive to penicillin. the patient was successfully treated with penicillin g and left the hospital without sequelae. in the literature, bacterial meningitis due to s. salivarius is rarely  reported. of the 28 cases, 18 occurred after lumbar puncture for diagnostic or for spinal anesthesia, 5 occurred following a bacteriemia for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy or intestinal neoplasia, and the other 5 in patients who had dural defects. we discuss the possible etiological causes of the meningitis due to s. salivarius cases reports. the early recognition of this entity and the aseptic precautions likely to reduce the incidence of infectious complications after lumbar puncture are stressed.

AB  == the feasibility of sequence analysis of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna (rdna) intergenic spacer (its) for the identification of clinically relevant viridans group streptococci (vs) was evaluated. the its regions of 29 reference strains (11 species) of vs were amplified by pcr and sequenced. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis,  s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the its lengths (246 to 391 bp) and sequences were highly conserved among strains within a species. the intraspecies similarity scores for the its sequences ranged from 0.98 to 1.0, except for the score for s. gordonii strains.  the interspecies similarity scores for the its sequences varied from 0.31 to 0.93. phylogenetic analysis of the its regions revealed that evolution of the regions of some species of vs is not parallel to that of the 16s rrna genes. one  hundred six clinical isolates of vs were identified by the rapid id 32 strep system (biomerieux vitek, marcy l'etoile, france) and by its sequencing, and the  level of disagreement between the two methods was 18% (19 isolates). most isolates producing discrepant results could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species by their its sequences. the accuracy of using its sequencing for identification of vs was verified by 16s rdna sequencing for all strains except strains of s. oralis and s. mitis, which were difficult to differentiate by their 16s rdna sequences. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by its sequencing is reliable and could be used as an alternative accurate method for identification of vs.

AB  == the presence of erm genes conferring constitutive and inducible resistance, as well as that of the mefa gene conferring only constitutive resistance, was investigated using pcr in 70 erythromycin resistant (mic>or=1 mg/l) strains of viridans group streptococci (vgs) (18 streptococcus mitis biotype 1, 16 s. mitis  biotype 2, 15 s. oralis, 12 s. salivarius and nine s. sanguis) isolated from the  oropharynx of healthy greek children. all of the 56 isolates belonging to resistance phenotype m harbored the mefa gene. all of the 14 isolates constitutively resistant to macrolides and lincosamides (phenotype cr) harbored the ermb gene. co-presence of both genes was not observed, whereas class a erm gene (previously known as ermtr) was not detected. our results are consistent with a possible role of vgs as a reservoir of resistance genes now prevalent in pathogenic species of streptococci.

TI  == viridans streptococcus bacteremia in children on chemotherapy for cancer: an underestimated problem.
AB  == the authors discuss the morbidity associated with viridans streptococcus bacteremia, and its implications on the choice of antibiotics used as prophylaxis and treatment. they retrospectively studied the case notes of 38 children who were being treated for various malignant conditions in their unit and developed 40 episodes of bacteremia with viridans streptococci between october 1995 and january 1999. viridans streptococci were the third commonest blood culture isolate during this period, after coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. the majority of the isolates were streptococcus mitis (55%). others were s. sanguis (25%), s. oralis (12.5%), s. salivarius (5%), and s. acidominimus (2.5%). twenty-five percent of the patients had been treated with regimens that included cytosine arabinoside, 60% were receiving prophylactic co-trimoxazole, and 87.5% were neutropenic. thirty percent of patients had abnormal chest x-rays, and 15% were hypotensive; 2 patients required admission to the intensive care unit. initial antibiotic therapy was changed because of failure of clinical response in 60% of cases, despite the infecting organism being sensitive in vitro. this study confirms the importance of viridans streptococci as a cause of bacteremia in pediatric hematology and oncology patients, leading to significant morbidity. further work is required to establish the optimal treatment for viridans streptococcus bacteremia.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == [effects of topical application of immunoglobulin yolk on mutans streptococci in  dental plaque].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the inhibitory effects of topical application of specific  immunoglobulin yolk antibodies (igy) to mutans streptococci on composition of human dental plaque. methods: a total of 24 healthy adult volunteers were selected and randomly distributed into three experimental groups. after a supragingival scaling, the subjects were treated with an application of igy containing spray (test group, n = 9), a 0.15% chlorhexidine(ch) spray(positive control group, n = 9) or a placebo phosphate buffered saline(pbs) spray without any active ingredients(negative control group, n = 6) three times daily for three weeks. pooled plaque samples from the smooth surfaces of teeth were collected for microbiologic analysis before administration (baseline, day 0), during treatment(days 7, 14 and 21) and after withdrawal of the agents(days 28, 42 and 56) and plaque index were recorded. microbial cultivation were performed by serially diluting the samples with pbs solution an cultivating the aliquots on mitis salivarius agar(ms) and ms supplemented with bacitracin (msb) for oral streptococci and mutans streptococci respectively. the number of colony-forming unit (cfu) per plate was counted and the percentage of mutans streptococci per oral streptococci in dental plaque were determined. the effect of igy on colonization of mutans streptococci were analyzed by an analysis of variance (anova). results: the plaque indexes remained unchanged, but mutans streptococci  in dental plaque was suppressed significantly following a short term(three weeks) application of igy, and low level of mutans streptococci persisted for at least 5 weeks after withdrawal of igy. conclusion: the results suggest that the immunization with specific immunoglobulin yolk against mutans streptococci could  be useful for long term suppression of mutans streptococci colonization in human  dental plaque.

TI  == identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes.
AB  == mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. these bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been reported to rapidly identify streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. however, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of  mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific pcr seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes (16s rrna genes pcr-rflp) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. we amplified 16s rrna gene sequences from genomic dna samples by pcr using universal primers and digested the pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. hpaii produced six rflp patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for s. sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus ferus were similar. rflp patterns produced with haeiii could separate these three species. furthermore, the rflp patterns predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank database agreed with the actual rflp patterns produced in the present study. the 16s rrna sequence comparisons can be  used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. therefore, 16s rrna genes pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.

TI  == non-mutans streptococci in patients receiving radiotherapy in the head and neck area.
AB  == objective: to study mutans and non-mutans streptococci in patients after radiotherapy of the head and neck. methods: oral rinse samples collected from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients before and after radiotherapy were diluted and  cultured on nonselective and selective media for enumeration of total cultivable  plaque flora, mutans and non-mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. non-mutans streptococci were identified biochemically and by 16s rdna sequence homology analysis. results: after irradiation, mutans streptococci were not isolated; the  levels of streptococcus mitis and lactobacilli increased significantly. the level of streptococcus salivarius increased, but the significance was the borderline. the level of streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly after irradiation. the abundance of other oral streptococci species showed no significant changes. conclusions: s. mitis and s. salivarius are the predominant non-mutans streptococci in the high-caries-risk oral flora following radiotherapy.

TI  == evaluation of clinical and microbiological features of deep carious lesions in primary molars.
AB  == purpose: concern about the survival of microorganisms in deep carious lesions may often lead to unnecessary exposure of the pulp during excavation. this study evaluated the relationship between microbiological and clinical results of deep carious lesions in primary molars. methods: clinical evaluation was performed on  72 deep carious lesions considered to have pulp perforation after traditional excavation. the dentin color and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales using the technique of bjorndal et al before restoration. for microbiological examination, dentin samples were taken by a sterile bur and transferred to transport fluid, then plated on tryptic soy agar for growth of total colony forming units. samples werethen transferred on rogosa sl agar for growth of oral lactobacilli and on mitis salivarius agar for growth of mutans streptococci. results: the proportion of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and total colony forming units increased when the dentin color and consistency increased. however, the proportion of lactobacilli was smaller than that of mutans streptococci in carious dentin samples. conclusions: contrary to expectations, the findings showed that the number of bacteria in carious dentin of primary molars was not significantly excessive.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

TI  == longitudinal study of the influence of removable partial denture and chemical control on the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva.
AB  == some studies have evaluated the salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms) in removable partial denture (rpd) users. saliva samples (2.0 ml) were obtained from 31 patients in six periods: (t0): immediately before installation of rpd; (t8): 8 days after t0; (t48): 48 days after t0; (t92): 92 days after t0; (t140): 140 days after t0 and (t189): 189 days after t0. the samples were vortexed and serially diluted from 10(-1) to 10(-6) in 0.05 m phosphate buffer (ph 7.4). from each dilution, 0.025 ml was plated on mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb). the plates were incubated in 5% co2 at 37 degrees c for 72 h. there was an increase (t-test, p < 0.05) in the number of ms between periods t0 and t48 (mean/s.d., cfu ml(-1) of saliva): t0: 2.26/4.43 x 10(6) and t48: 0.47/1.48 x 10(8). after this, intensive treatment with chx was accomplished in 29 patients. saliva samples were obtained after treatment in four periods: (t24 h): 24 h after t0; (t14): 14 days  after t24 h; (t28): 28 days after t24 h, and (t63): 63 days after t24 h. the number of ms in saliva did not decrease (t-test, p > 0.05). a new chx formulation was applied in 15 patients. saliva samples were obtained in periods: (t0): before new chx application; (t24 h): 24 h after t0 and (t82): 82 days after t0. the new  chx reduced ms levels in saliva: (mean/s.d., cfu ml(-1) of saliva): t0: 6.64/8.47 x 10(6) and t24 h: 3.2/4.27 x 10(5) (sign rank, p < 0.05). in conclusion, there was a significant increase in the number of ms in saliva after the installation of rpd. the intensive treatment with a properly formulated chx was effective in the reduction of ms, between 24 h and 82 days after its application.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == as part of a series of longitudinal studies on the development of the indigenous  microflora of the upper respiratory tract, the establishment of streptococci in the oral cavity and nasopharynx and iga1 protease production by the early streptococcal flora was examined in 50 healthy caucasian infants at the ages of 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. in the oral cavity, streptococci were found in all infants on every sampling occasion, streptococcus mitis biovar 1 being the main finding in each age group. s. salivarius and s. mitis biovar 2 reached their highest prevalence during the first year of life, whereas the prevalence of s. oralis and s. sanguis showed no significant increase before 12 months of age. salivary streptococci mainly consisted of the above-mentioned species during the  follow-up period. in contrast to the oral cavity, no stable colonisation pattern  was observed for viridans streptococci in the nasopharynx. s. mitis biovar 1 and  s. pneumoniae, a traditional respiratory pathogen, were the principal streptococcal species among nasopharyngeal isolates. iga1 protease production by  early streptococci was common in infancy. among the oral streptococcal microflora, s. mitis biovar 1 (especially during the first year of life) and s. oralis and s. sanguis constituted the main species responsible for this enzyme activity. in the nasopharynx, iga1 protease was produced by s. mitis biovar 1, s. oralis and s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, streptococcal colonisation differs in these two close habitats in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == comparison of five selective media for the growth and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. this study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of s. mutans  (nctc 10449), and for enumerating s. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. methods: the media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (msb), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (mskb), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (gstb), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (tys20b) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agars. these were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. results: the results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/ml, the recovery of the laboratory s. mutans strain was highest in tycsb agar, followed by in descending order by tys20b, msb, gstb, and mskb (p<0.01). similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a  group of children. in the clinical samples, tycsb again showed the highest recovery rates of s. mutans compared to the other four media. results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and s. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 log 10 cfu/ml. in addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in tycsb compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. conclusion:  the results of our study suggest that tycsb is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of s. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == comparison of the activity of four chitosan derivatives in reducing initial adherence of oral bacteria onto tooth surfaces.
AB  == we examined the effects of four kinds of chitosan derivatives on initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human anterior teeth surfaces. the buccal surfaces of anterior teeth were used as the experimental surfaces. they were divided into five rectangle areas with outer dimensions of about 2 mm x 4 mm. after applying two ml of a sample solution onto the tooth surfaces, an examiner wiped each rectangle area with a sterilized plastic swab one, three and six hours later. then we measured bacterial counts in sterilized swabs with mitis salivarius agar. we found that the order of magnitude of the inhibitory effect on the adherence of oral bacteria was low molecular chitosan > phosphorylated chitosan > amorphous chitosan > carboxymethyl chitosan. the solution containing 0.5% low molecular chitosan depressed the bacterial adherence to the same extent  as a 50 ppm chlorhexidine digluconate solution for three hours, and 0.1% phosphorylated chitosan also exhibited an inhibitory effect in bacterial adherence for one hour. amorphous chitosan had a moderate inhibitory effect, but  no clear inhibitory activity was found with 0.1% carboxymethyl chitosan. these results suggest that low molecular chitosan and phosphorylated chitosan have the  potential to effectively inhibit the initial adherence of oral bacteria onto human tooth surfaces.

TI  == a clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == [susceptibility to penicillin and 13 antimicrobial agents in erythromycin-resistant viridans group streptococci isolated from blood cultures].
AB  == from march 1998 to june 1999, we studied 63 sequential blood culture isolates of  viridans group streptococci which showed a 49% resistance to erythromycin. a high level of resistance to penicillin (46%) was also found. a statistically significant correlation was detected between the two types of resistance. the erythromycin-resistant strains were phenotypically and genotypically characterized, and no differences were found between the resistance to penicillin and the m or mls(b) phenotypes. the penicillin-erythromycin-resistant strains included: 16 s. mitis, five s. sanguis and one s. salivarius. the rank order of activity (% of susceptibility) for all 14 agents against 31 erythromycin- resistant isolates was the following: vancomycin = rifampicin (100) > chloramphenicol (98) > meropenem (65) > cefotaxime (61) > amoxicillin- clavulanic acid (42) > cefepime = ciprofloxacin (39) > tetracycline = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36) > cefuroxime (32) > penicillin = ampicillin =  cefaclor (29). the species s. milleri and s. bovis were the most susceptible. the most resistant strains were two s. mitis and one s. sanguis and showed multiresistance to six different groups of antimicrobial agents. the frequent association between macrolide resistance and resistance to other antimicrobial agents suggests that the susceptibility of all clinically significant isolates needs to be evaluated and alternative agents for the prevention and treatment of  viridans group streptococci infections should be identified.

TI  == vaccination with fima from streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.
AB  == the fima protein of streptococcus parasanguis is a virulence factor in the rat model of endocarditis, and immunization with fima protects rats against homologous bacterial challenge. because fima-like proteins are widespread among the oral streptococci, the leading cause of native valve endocarditis, we evaluated the ability of this vaccinogen to protect rats when challenged by other streptococcal species. here we report that fima vaccination produced antibodies that cross-reacted with and protected against challenge by the oral streptococci  s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius. fima thus has promise as a vaccinogen to  control infective endocarditis caused by oral streptococci.

TI  == [typing of streptococcus mutans (serotype c) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: to study the relationship between genetic diversity within streptococcus mutans (c), and dental caries. methods: one reference strain (gs5)  was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial ap-pcr conditions. isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as streptococcus mutans (c). chromosomal dna was extracted from those isolates by chelex. one random primer, opa-05 was used as a  template in pcr reaction. all amplification reactions were conducted in a volume  of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/l each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. we varied  the concentrations of mgcl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/l), template dna (2-40 ng), and primer  (0.3-0.5 mumol/l) to determine the optical conditions for ap-pcr. the temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees c for 1 min, at 36 degrees c for 2 min, at 72 degrees c for 2 min. the initial denaturation was at 94 degrees c for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees c for 5 min. results: the mgcl2 concentration in 4 mmol/l and the primer concentration in 0.5  mumol/l produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. we found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. in high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were colonized. conclusions: isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) exist apparent genetic diversity. the genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.

TI  == retention of oral microorganisms on conventional and resin-modified glass-ionomer cements.
AB  == secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. the placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. the aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (chelon-fil and vidrion r) and resin-modified (vitremer and fuji ii lc) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a  hybrid composite resin (z100) as a control. twelve volunteers wore hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. the specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ringer-pras. microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% n2, 10% co2), at 37 degrees c, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. the resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. the conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. we have earlier shown that habitual xylitol  consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction  in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at 2 years of age. the aim of the present study was to assess the children's ms counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. at baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of ms. the mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (f) and chlorhexidine (chx) groups. in the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received chx or f varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. at the 2-year  examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. at the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. for children's ms analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age  of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. the persons involved in the  collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. both the plaque and salivary ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. in all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. at the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having ms colonization was 2.3-fold in the f group (95% ci 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. this difference was statistically significant. even at 6 years of age, the salivary ms levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (anova, p<0.001). in conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms was still found in the children's  ms counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius fimbriae are composed of a glycoprotein containing a repeated motif assembled into a filamentous nondissociable structure.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius, a gram-positive bacterium found in the human oral cavity, expresses flexible peritrichous fimbriae. in this paper, we report purification and partial characterization of s. salivarius fimbriae. fimbriae were extracted by shearing the cell surface of hyperfimbriated mutant a37 (a spontaneous mutant of s. salivarius atcc 25975) with glass beads. preliminary experiments showed that s. salivarius fimbriae did not dissociate when they were  incubated at 100 degrees c in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. this characteristic was used to separate them from other cell surface components by successive gel filtration chromatography procedures. fimbriae with molecular masses ranging from 20 x 10(6) to 40 x 10(6) da were purified. examination of purified fimbriae by electron microscopy revealed the presence of filamentous structures up to 1 microm long and 3 to 4 nm in diameter. biochemical studies of  purified fimbriae and an amino acid sequence analysis of a fimbrial internal peptide revealed that s. salivarius fimbriae were composed of a glycoprotein assembled into a filamentous structure resistant to dissociation. the internal amino acid sequence was composed of a repeated motif of two amino acids alternating with two modified residues: a/x/t-e-q-m/phi, where x represents a modified amino acid residue and phi represents a blank cycle. immunolocalization  experiments also revealed that the fimbriae were associated with a wheat germ agglutinin-reactive carbohydrate. immunolabeling experiments with antifimbria polyclonal antibodies showed that antigenically related fimbria-like structures were expressed in two other human oral streptococcal species, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus constellatus.

TI  == oral colonization and cariogenicity of streptococcus gordonii in specific pathogen-free tan:spfom(om)br rats consuming starch or sucrose diets.
AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == automated fluorescent in situ hybridization for the specific detection and quantification of oral streptococci in dental plaque.
AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

TI  == caries risk assessment from dental plaque and salivary streptococcus mutans counts on two culture media.
AB  == this study attempted to determine which combination of plaque or saliva, and tryptic soy agar, bacitracin (tsy20b) or mitis salivarius, bacitracin media, yielded the highest caries-predictive values for mutans counts in children with different caries prevalence. sixty children were divided into three equally sized groups: caries free, low caries and high caries. eighteen months later, their caries incidence and initial mutans count were compared. fissure plaque on tsy20b yielded a high correlation between mutans counts and caries prevalence (p<0.009,  r=3346) and incidence (p<0.003, r=4521). the caries-predictive values obtained demonstrate that the coefficient of variation of mutans counts from lower first-molar fissure plaque on tsy20b accounts for 20.4% of the variation in final caries index. this strong correlation provides a valuable tool for the identification of caries-prone individuals.

TI  == abiotrophia species in early dental plaque.
AB  == the most characteristic traits that distinguish abiotrophia strains from other streptococci are nutrient requirements, satellitism and pyrrolidonyl arylamidase  activity. the presence of abiotrophia strains was studied in early dental plaque  formed on sucrose-containing and sucrose-free (glucose-containing) diets. the isolates were from 0- to 3-day dental plaque formed on the buccal surface of a lower premolar in six subjects. identification of abiotrophia strains was based on their pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity. they were among the predominant cultivable microorganisms isolated from diluted suspensions of early dental plaque formed on both diets. using biochemical tests without testing for pyrrolidonyl arylamidase activity, the abiotrophia strains would be biochemically identified as streptococcus mitis or unidentified streptococci, and many isolates first classified as unidentified streptococci were abiotrophia strains. generally, identifications using partial 16s rrna sequences confirmed the identifications obtained biochemically. however, abiotrophia elegans and gemella  strains were biochemically identified as abiotrophia adiacens. abiotrophia strains produce hydrogen sulfide, which may influence the metabolism and ecology  of dental plaque and act as a virulence factor in periodontal disease. they are not able to grow on tryptic soy agar. in the present study, some s. mitis strains were not able to grow on mitis salivarius agar, and some abiotrophia strains were able to grow on this medium. these observations indicate that the use of these media for estimation of total viable counts and number of streptococci introduces systematic error in studies of microorganisms in dental plaque.

TI  == the galu gene of streptococcus pneumoniae that codes for a udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase is highly polymorphic and suitable for molecular typing and phylogenetic studies.
AB  == the enzyme utp-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (udp-glucose pyrophosphorylase, udpg:pp) is synthesized by practically all organisms, although prokaryotic udpg:pps are evolutionarily unrelated to the eukaryotic counterparts. the primary structure of prokaryotic udpg:pps is well conserved, although little  information exists on the polymorphism of the genes coding for these enzymes. it  has been reported that the galu gene encoding the streptococcus pneumoniae udpg:pp is absolutely required for the synthesis of the capsular polysaccharide,  a sine qua non prerequisite for virulence. a 594 bp fragment covering 66% of the  galu gene from 37 pneumococcal isolates and the type strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sobrinus has been amplified by pcr and sequenced. up to 21 different alleles were found in s. pneumoniae. they possess a mosaic-like structure and belong to, at least, two evolutionarily distinct families that show a sequence divergence of 15-20%. in spite of its marked polymorphism, phylogenetic relationships among pneumococcal strains deduced from the galu gene matched those previously established by using alternative approaches. comparison of the pneumococcal galu alleles with those from other streptococci indicated the existence of a complex network of genetic interchange. the galu gene represents an informative marker to be used alone or in conjunction with other molecular typing methods.

TI  == mutans streptococci prevalence in puerto rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  == purpose: previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. this communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. methods: the study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (nb+). pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in reduced transparent fluid (rtf); they were serially diluted and plated onto mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin (msb) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37  c and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative  ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. results: fifty one of the  60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). the density of  infection did not vary by age for plaque (p = 0.32) or saliva (p = 0.64). conclusion: these findings support the concept that nb+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in puerto rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with  age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

AB  == macrolide resistance has been widely studied in streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae although not in viridans group streptococci (vgs). we studied 30 blood culture isolates of viridans group streptococci (25 resistant to erythromycin: 10 s. mitis, 8 s. milleri, 6 s. sanguis and 1 s. salivarius; and 5  susceptible: 2 s. mitis, 2 s. milleri and 1 s. sanguis). we carried out a double-disk test and determined mics. the susceptibility testing was carried out  by agar dilution for 14-, 15- and 16-member lactone ring macrolides, as well as for clindamycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin. fifty-six percent of the erithromycin-resistant strains (6 s. mitis, 6 s. milleri and 2 s. sanguis) showed an mls(b) phenotype, with a high level of intrinsic resistance to all the macrolides studied and clindomycin; 28&#37; were of the m phenotype (4 s. sanguis, 2 s. mitis and 1 s. salivarius). we found a third resistance phenotype,  which was present in 4 strains with mics of 2-8 microg/ml, with resistance to macrolides and different degrees of resistance to clindamycin. all isolates were  fully susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. the mls(b) and m phenotypes initially described in s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae are also observed in vgs.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == the effect of nicotine on growth of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == there is little information available concerning the effects of nicotine on oral  bacteria; and in particular, streptococcus mutans, an important microbe in the etiology of dental caries. to test the effects of nicotine, streptococcus mutans  were incubated in either 0 or 10(-1)-10(-7) m concentrations of nicotine and then plated onto mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. colonies were counted and treatment groups compared. both 10(-1) and 10(-2) m nicotine caused total inhibition of bacterial growth, while 10(-3) and 10(-4) m produced significantly more colonies  than control. also, 10(-6) and 10(-7) m nicotine produced a significant reduction in the mean number of colonies. these results suggest a biphasic, dosage-dependent effect of nicotine on the growth of streptococcus mutans. since  10(-3) m nicotine has been reported within the saliva of smokeless tobacco users, use of these products could stimulate growth of streptococcus mutans and possibly place the user at increased risk for dental caries.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. one hundred sixty-nine  mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. all mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. the mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. the children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. ms were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. the ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. the salivary ms levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. at two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of ms. in conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at two years of age. the effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.

TI  == relationship among mutans streptococci, "low-ph" bacteria, and lodophilic polysaccharide-producing bacteria in dental plaque and early enamel caries in humans.
AB  == multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. we have studied the bacterial flora and ph-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. the findings on the plaque flora are reported here. the buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. a low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area;  a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. the latter group was divided  into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (ms) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum ph in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-ms flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. plaques  covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of ms. the  plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. over half  of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-ph"-type organisms (minimum ph < 4.4). many of these were neither ms nor "low-ph" non-ms. the numerical emergence of ms in plaque appeared to be preceded  often by other types of "low-ph" bacteria, including the non-ms. caries development in the absence or presence of ms as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.

TI  == variables affecting salivary streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  == background: several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) counts. in the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. methods: forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (gc, al). the number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. the presumptive sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. one sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum ph value recorded, during 5 hrs of  incubation in 5% sucrose solution. the children's parents or guardians completed  a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. the effect of the explanatory variables on sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. results: the regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, r2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, r2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, r2 increment  = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). conclusions: on the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism.
AB  == the utility of pcr analysis of transfer dna intergenic spacer length polymorphism (tdna-ilp) for the identification to the species level of clinically relevant viridans streptococci was evaluated with a collection of reference strains of 15  species of the salivarius, anginosus, mitis and mutans rrna homology groups. pcr  products generated by using fluorescent, outwardly directed, consensus tdna primers were analysed by electrophoresis on denaturating polyacrylamide gels and  by laser fluorescence scanning. eleven species showed specific and distinct tdna  patterns: streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis,  streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus criceti and streptococcus ratti. indistinguishable patterns were obtained among two groups of species: streptococcus vestibularis and streptococcus salivarius on the one hand and streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedius on the other. s. mitis strains produced heterogeneous patterns that could be separated into three groups: a group containing s. mitis biovar 1 and two s. mitis biovar 2 groups, one of which clustered with s. parasanguinis strains while the other showed patterns unrelated to other species. these results agree in part with protein electrophoretic analysis showing that s. mitis biovar 2 strains belong to several streptococcal taxa. in conclusion, pcr analysis of tdna-ilp holds promise for rapid identification of viridans streptococci that are difficult to identify by phenotypic tests.

TI  == isolation of bacteria from cervical lymph nodes in patients with oral cancer.
AB  == thirty patients with oral mucosal cancer were studied in relation to oral mucosal damage and bacterial translocation to the regional lymph nodes in the neck. all 30 patients (gingiva 11, tongue 13, cheek mucosa four, oral floor two) underwent  extensive, clean-contaminated, head-and-neck surgery (including neck dissection)  with free flap reconstruction. a total of 153 lymph nodes was harvested for microbial and histological examination. viable bacteria were isolated from 70 lymph nodes (45.8%) from 25 patients (83.3%). bacterial cells in the nodes were detected by scanning electron microscopy. bacterial translocation was found more  often in metastatic nodes (75.0%) than in uninvolved nodes (40.3%) (p = 0.015; chi2 test). gingival carcinoma yielded 56.4% of bacterial growth in the regional  lymph nodes compared to tongue (40.3%), oral floor (40.0%) and cheek mucosa (37.5%). as the gingival carcinoma group includes more t4 cases (11/11; 100%) than the other three groups (7/19; 36.8%), bacterial translocation in uninvolved  nodes could be caused by the size and invasion of the primary oral tumor. oral streptococci (streptococcus intermedius, strep. constellatus, strep. oralis, strep. mitis, strep. sanguis, strep. salivarius) were the most common isolates. aerobic enteric bacteria (enterococcus, escherichia, klebsiella etc.) were also found in the lymph nodes. among the anaerobic bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. were isolated from 12 patients. damaged oral mucosa in patients with oral cancer  might allow the new bacterial colonization on the surface and subsequently drain  the bacteria into the regional lymph nodes as well as the general circulation.

AB  == purpose: to establish a method to measure microbial kill caused by ultrasonic cleaning. secondarily, to estimate the escape of bacteria from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions during operation of the unit. materials and methods: three commercial enzymatic detergents and saline were used as cleaners. depending on detergent, initial operational temperature was 21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c. streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 (s. mutans suspensions) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cells/ml in saline. suspensions (2000 ml) at the desired temperatures were added to the cleaner. aliquots were removed, serially diluted in letheen broth and spread plated over mitis salivarius agar. appropriate amounts of detergent solutions were added to s. mutans suspensions and the cleaner operated for 20 minutes. aliquots were then removed and plated. the process was repeated twice. plates were aerobically incubated at 37 degrees c for 7 days and the colonies counted. the procedure was repeated using three temperatures of s. mutans suspensions (21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c), but without detergent or ultrasound. also, detergents were added to 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions and allowed to sit for 20 minutes without ultrasonic cleaning. microbial sampling was done as previously described. results: results when ultrasound was used indicated that little kill (5-15%) occurred in 21 degrees c or 37 degrees c detergent solutions. greater kill (25-35%) was noted with 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline. complete kill was accomplished with 60 degrees c saline or the 60 degrees c detergent solution. when ultrasound and detergent were not used, there was no kill in 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline, but complete kill in 60 degrees c saline. in the absence of ultrasound no kill was noted in 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions to which detergent had been added. total kill of s. mutans was observed in 60 degrees c saline or 60 degrees c detergent with ultrasound or after a 20-minute exposure in 60 degrees c saline without ultrasonic cleaning. very few bacteria escaped from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions into the air during the cleaning process. placement of the unit lid effectively reduced emissions to zero.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == molecular relationships and antimicrobial susceptibilities of viridans group streptococci isolated from blood of neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  == from january 1995 to may 1998, 57 episodes of bacteremia due to viridans group streptococci were identified in 50 febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic  malignancies. four patients experienced two separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia, and one patient had four separate episodes of streptococcal bacteremia. strains were identified to species level as streptococcus mitis (n =  37), streptococcus oralis (n = 19), and streptococcus salivarius (n = 1). epidemiologic relatedness of these strains was studied by using pcr-based fingerprinting with m13 and eric-2 primers and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzyme smai. all strains that were isolated from different patients exhibited unique fingerprint patterns, thus suggesting that viridans group streptococcal bacteremia usually derives from an endogenous source. cross-transmission of strains between patients could not be established. four s.  mitis isolates recovered during four separate bacteremic episodes in a single patient had identical fingerprint patterns. susceptibility testing was carried out by broth microdilution technique according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards guidelines. the mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited were (in milligrams per liter) as follows: 0. 5 (penicillin), 0.5 (amoxicillin), 0.25 (cefotaxime), 2 (chloramphenicol), 4 (erythromycin), 0.5 (clindamycin), >/=32 (tetracycline), >/=32 (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 4 (ciprofloxacin), 0.5 (sparfloxacin), 0.5 (vancomycin), 0.25 (teicoplanin), and 1  (quinupristin-dalfopristin). high-level penicillin resistance (mic, >/=4 mg/liter) was found in one isolate only, but intermediate penicillin resistance was noted in 11 isolates (19%). resistance rates to other drugs were as follows:  7% (amoxicillin), 4% (cefotaxime), 4% (chloramphenicol), 32% (erythromycin), 9% (clindamycin), 39% (tetracycline), 68% (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), 23% (ciprofloxacin), 0% (sparfloxacin), 0% (vancomycin), 0% (teicoplanin), and 0% (quinupristin-dalfopristin).

AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

AB  == the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of daily supervised rinsing with a specially formulated, alum-containing mouthrinse on plaque and salivary levels of s. mutans, s. mitis and s. salivarius in caries susceptible children (12-14 years old) and to monitor the effect on the oral tissues and acceptability to subjects. forty-five subjects were divided into 3 groups (n = 15). group i received an experimental group with a mouthrinse containing hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate (alum). group 2 received a vehicle control group containing the same mouthrinse, but without alum and group 3 had a treatment control with distilled water. all subjects continued normal oral hygiene habits during the study. salivary and plaque levels were obtained at base line, 2 weeks and 4 weeks and evaluated for microbiologic procedures. also, potential adverse effects on oral tissues were performed during every visit. the mean plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus (s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius) for the experimental group were significantly reduced after 2 weeks and 4 weeks compared  with baseline. the plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus of experimental and vehicle control group differed statistically from each other after 4 weeks, with the strongest reduction in the experimental group and there was statistically difference between treatment control and vehicle control or experimental groups at each time interval. no evidence of deleterious effects to  the oral tissues was observed. daily use of an alum-containing mouthrinse was safe and produced significant reduction effect on plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus and can be used in children for the preventive dentistry.

TI  == speciation of presumptive viridans streptococci from early onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  == twenty isolates resembling viridans streptococci, 16 from blood and four from gastric aspirates, from 17 cases of early onset neonatal sepsis were identified by the api20 strep, rapid id 32 strep and conventional tests plus hydrolysis of methylumbelliferyl glycoside substrates. nineteen of the isolates were identified as species of viridans streptococci and one as a leuconostoc sp. ten of the isolates were streptococcus oralis, three s. mitis biotype 1, two s. mitis biotype 2 and one each of s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius and s. intermedius. the rapid id 32 strep and conventional plus methylumbelliferyl tests gave the same species identity for 17 of the isolates. s. intermedius was identified by the rapid id 32 strep as s. constellatus and s. salivarius as s. equinus, with s. salivarius at lower probability. the api20 strep failed to identify s. vestibularis and identified s. salivarius as s. defectivus. the absence of certain critical tests, including urea hydrolysis, does not allow the  api20 strep to identify all the currently recognised species of viridans steptococci. the species distribution was unexpected and the incidence of s. oralis and other viridans streptococci in vaginal swabs from prenatal patients is being investigated further.

TI  == antibacterial temporary filling materials: the effect of adding various ratios of ag-zn-zeolite.
AB  == the effect of a new type of antibacterial temporary filling material was evaluated. ag-zn-zeolite (bactekiller, kanebo, japan) and sio2 filler were incorporated into urethane acrylate monomer paste in amounts of 5/55, 10/50, 20/40 and 30/30 wt%, respectively. the present study was designed to use a dye penetration test to measure direct inhibition of bacterial growth of four oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis). the amounts of silver and zinc ions released from these materials were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. the results indicated that the occurrence of marginal leakage was low in all of these materials. these materials exhibited prominent in-vitro antibacterial activity against s. mutans and s. mitis. the ag-zn-zeolite in these materials was able to  release very small but detectable amounts of ag and zn even 4 weeks after the immersion started. the larger the amounts of ag-zn-zeolite that were incorporated, the greater the release of silver and zinc. however, it appears that increasing antibacterial activity is not promoted by the higher ratio of ag-zn-zeolite.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == effect of radiotherapy on the levels of secretory immunoglobulin a against indigenous and virulent streptococci.
AB  == it is well known that the frequency of upper respiratory infection is clinically  increased after radiotherapy of the head and neck region. this study found higher antibacterial secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) activity against three indigenous streptococci (streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis i) and s. pneumoniae in patients who had undergone radiation therapy of the head and neck region than in control subjects. this showed no relation to the extent of the radiation field. compared with before radiotherapy, the s-iga titer against s. pneumoniae and its ratio to the activities against the indigenous streptococci were significantly higher in patients with fully irradiated major salivary glands. these results indicated that the radiotherapy promoted the antigen-specific s-iga production of virulent streptococci in most patients with  head and neck cancer, even more than 6 months after radiotherapy. the resulting altered balance in the s-iga system of normal indigenous streptococci may also impair the ability to maintain the stable bacterial interference between normal indigenous and virulent streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavity.

AB  == the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were investigated. s. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized  human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose. this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph 5.0 or 6.5. at ph 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was generated. after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. identical experiments were made with f- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mm). both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at ph 6.5. when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm hoscn/oscn-, 0.5 mm f- or both. f-, hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on s. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

TI  == mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  == the msb agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and streptococcus mutans. although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, s.  mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this mitis salivarius agar (msa). because the number of s. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the msb 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. this would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. the results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and s. mutans is obtained in the msb 10% sacarose medium, 2) s. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle  jar (10% co2). msb 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.

TI  == effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  == ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. however, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. no viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. however, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. this data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.

TI  == differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  == different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (ms) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. to quantitate the variations of  ms estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. detection of ms in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement  with the presence of ms in pooled plaque samples. ms detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled  plaque or oral swab samples. when caries status was used as the criterion of validity of ms estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). as a result, the measure of association between ms and caries was biased (towards null) when ms status was based on stimulated saliva samples. interestingly though, in enumerating ms, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of ms (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. the use of different culture media for detection of ms gave different results as  well. ms detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and ms levels were lower (p = 0.0001)  when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. together with the relative ease of  sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of ms and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of ms, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.

TI  == adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of oral streptococcal cells.
AB  == oral tissues, especially tooth surfaces, are covered with a layer of salivary proteins. oral bacterial cells that adsorb to salivary components accumulated on  the tooth surface are, as a rule, covered with the same components, especially proteins. thus, it is possible that the salivary proteins covering the bacterial  cells are related to the adhesion of bacteria to oral tissues. the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanisms of adsorption of salivary proteins to the surface of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis and s. salivarius using an adsorption  assay with salivary proteins labeled with tritiated formaldehyde. the results showed that salivary proteins adsorbed more to s. salivarius than to s. mitis, and least to s. sanguis. it was evident that hydrophobic bonding was involved in  the adsorption of salivary proteins to the bacterial cells tested. the amount of  salivary proteins adsorbed to s. mitis and s. salivarius was decreased by the presence of phosphate, that to s. sanguis was increased by the presence of a divalent cation such as ca2+, and that to all bacteria tested was inhibited in different ways by the presence of sugars. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed to s. sanguis and s. salivarius was reduced effectively by pretreatment  of the cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin and papain. in the case of s. mitis, the  amount of adsorbed salivary proteins was decreased by pretreatment of the cells with chymotrypsin only, and was increased by pretreatment with lipase. these results indicate that there are different mechanisms of adsorption of salivary protein to the cell surfaces of oral streptococci.

AB  == scanning electron (sem) microscopy of epoxy replicas made from dental impressions has shown that in buccal gingival recession the root surfaces are devoid of cementum, leaving the dentin exposed. in this study replication techniques were applied to correlate the micromorphology of the buccocervical region with early streptococcal attachment. the subjects were 27 healthy young adults. the buccocervical surfaces of all the premolars were meticulously cleaned. the subjects fasted for 2 h before impression-taking. replicas were made from impressions in hydrophilic a-silicone, and streptococcal attachment was visualized by light microscopy of mitis-salivarius agar replicas incubated anaerobically for 48 h. the surface micromorphology was documented by sem of corresponding epoxy replicas. colonization only 2 h after cleaning was very sparse. sites with healthy or inflamed gingivae had markedly different colonization patterns in the sulcular region. in 4 subjects with a total of 12 sites where gingival recession, undetected clinically, was disclosed by sem, representative colonies were retrieved and identified microbiologically to species level. two healthy sites per subject were also sampled. streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus were identified from eight sites with exposed root dentin. s. oralis predominated on the enamel surfaces. the method offers a valuable complement to in situ and in vitro microbiologic studies of exposed dentin and a  novel technique for sampling clinical isolates of streptococci.

TI  == emergence in human dental plaque and host distribution of amylase-binding streptococci.
AB  == salivary amylase is known to bind specifically to several species of oral streptococci. to assess the importance of this interaction in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity, we determined the proportion and identity of amylase-binding bacteria (abb) in dental plaque of humans and various salivary amylase-secreting and non-secreting mammalian species. the numbers of abb in undisturbed plaque collected over time from tooth surfaces of six human volunteers or from 14 other mammalian species were determined by means of a replicating assay. the mean proportion of abb cultured aerobically from human teeth at 2 h was 10.5% (sd 10), at 8 h 7.9% (8), at 24 h 13% (11), and at 48 h 12% (9). the mean proportion of anaerobically cultured abb found at 2 h was 3% (sd 4), at 8 h 5% (5), at 24 h 12% (9), and at 48 h 16% (12). amylase-binding bacteria cultured from these samples resembled streptococcus mitis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus crista, or unidentified streptococci. in addition, only animals exhibiting salivary amylase activity in their saliva harbored abb (ranging from 2 to 31% of the total flora), with the exception of the pig, where no abb were found to colonize, despite considerable amylase activity in saliva. only strains resembling s. mitis and s. salivarius and unspeciated strains were isolated from these mammals. these results suggest that amylase-binding streptococci are the predominant abb in human plaque, and their numbers generally increase as plaque develops. since abb colonized only the oral cavities of hosts demonstrating salivary amylase activity, the ability to bind amylase may play an important role in oral colonization by these bacteria.

TI  == microorganisms on toothbrushes at day-care centers.
AB  == the microflora on 44 toothbrushes at 4 day-care centers in the city of goteborg have been investigated as a presumptive risk factor for transmission of microorganisms by children. non-supervised toothbrushing without the use of toothpaste was performed at the day-care centers twice a day. streptococci, predominantly s. salivarius, s. sanguis, and s. mitis, were the most frequently recorded group of microorganisms and generally constituted the greatest part of the flora (on average, 50%). beta-hemolytic streptococci were not found in any sample. haemophilus species were noted in 82% of the samples. h. parainfluenzae being the most frequent, and h. influenzae being identified in only one sample. anaerobes constituted on average a third of the microflora. staphylococci were identified in 86% of the samples, s. epidermidis dominating. fungi including molds were found in 50% of the samples, and from one day-care center large numbers of enteric organisms were identified. thus this study shows that unsupervised toothbrushing at day-care centers can be questioned, more from a general hygienic point of view than from the risk of transmitting serious pathogens.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the susceptibility of five bacterial species to seven dentinal bonding agents was examined in vitro. agar diffusion tests using filterpaper disks containing 10 microl each of conditioner, primer, or resin were performed on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. of  all the compounds tested, gluma cleanser and gluma etchant showed the strongest growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for prisma universal bond 2 and superlux universal bond 2 systems. the primers of gluma, denthesive, and scotchbond 2 displayed antibacterial activity that, in some cases, was comparable to that of 0.2% chlorhexidine. zones of inhibition were seen for the resin materials of scotchbond 2 and tripton with streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. no inhibition was seen after these resins were cured, whereas the antibacterial effect of xr-bond on s sanguis and a viscosus was not affected by light curing.

TI  == inhibition of platelet binding and aggregation by streptococcal exopolysaccharide.
AB  == streptococcal exopolysaccharides are major virulence factors in the pathogenesis  of endocarditis. they promote bacterial adherence to valves and subsequent vegetation formation. since platelet binding and aggregation by streptococci are  postulated mechanisms for endocardial colonization and vegetation production, the effect of exopolysaccharide on binding and aggregation was evaluated by flow cytometry and aggregometry. streptococcus salivarius d1, a minimal exopolysaccharide producer, bound human platelets extensively (86.8% of bacteria  bound by 1 min). s. salivarius m13 and m15 and streptococcus mitis m4 produced larger amounts of exopolysaccharide and bound platelets significantly less (52.6%, 51.2%, 52.8%, respectively). exopolysaccharide also inhibited platelet aggregation: strains with minimal exopolysaccharide aggregated platelets maximally, while strains with extensive exopolysaccharide failed to induce aggregation. removal of exopolysaccharide by shearing restored aggregation by these latter strains. thus, exopolysaccharides can inhibit the binding and aggregation of platelets by streptococci. the virulence associated with exopolysaccharide may result from the inhibition of platelet-mediated interactions that limit disease progression.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

TI  == oral streptococcal colonization of infants.

AB  == both intra- and inter-individual variation in salivary flow rate, buffer effect,  and the levels of salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli were analyzed in  128 11-year-old children. the follow-up period was 9 months, with six saliva samplings done at regular intervals. inter-individual variation was relatively large in paraffin-stimulated salivary flow rate: low (< 1.0 ml/min) and high (> or = 2.0 ml/min) flow rates were measured in 18% and 13% of the children, respectively. intraindividual variation during the follow-up period was found in  63% of the boys and in 73% of the girls. the buffer effect stayed stable in all samplings in 59% of the boys and in 42% of the girls. buffer effect was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in girls than in boys. mutans streptococci were analyzed by a chair-side method (strip mutans test) and by cultivation on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the results of the two methods correlated highly significantly (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). with the strip mutans test no variation in test scores occurred in 49% of all subjects in all six samplings, whereas the respective percentage for msb scores was only 19%. no variation in salivary lactobacilli occurred in only 18% of the subjects, and in 13% the intraindividual variation was as high as > or = 3 logs. these results show that in young teenagers with a developing dentition, simultaneous changes in behavioral, hormonal, and dietary factors make single-point measurements of salivary factors too unreliable for caries-diagnostic or predictive purposes.

AB  == the isolation frequency and distribution of eight recently defined streptococcal  species have been investigated in the saliva of adults and that of both predentate and dentate children. the effects of frequency of sugar intake and tooth presence on the distribution of streptococcal species were also analyzed. saliva samples were collected from 121 subjects divided into three study groups:  (a) 56 predentate children (predentate group), (b) 37 dentate children (dentate group), and (c) 28 adults (adult group). up to 17 biochemical and enzymatic tests were used to categorize streptococcal isolates into s. mitis, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. mutans, and s. gordonii. the mean total and streptococcal salivary colony-forming units (cfu) were lowest in the predentate group and highest in the adult group. streptococci  were found in all the study subjects, and there was no obvious relationship between the total or streptococcal cfu and the number of teeth or the frequency of sugar intake. there was a wide variation in the isolation frequency of streptococcal species in the three study groups. s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. salivarius were the most frequent species isolated, and together they comprised 83% of the total streptococcal isolates. in contrast to studies using older classifications, s. sanguis was a minor species in the saliva though found more often in adults than in children (p < 0.04). s. anginosus was a minor species found in about 10% of adults and children. s. gordonii was detected rarely and only in dentate subjects. s. mutans was detected only in dentate subjects, significantly greater in adults (57.1%) than in children (5.4%, p < 0.001).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a comparison between commercial kits and conventional methods for enumeration of  salivary mutans streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli levels were determined by conventional  and commercial dip-slide methods in three groups of young subjects, aged 5-6 years (93 subjects), 12-13 years (78 subjects) and 18-20 years (81 subjects). using the same paraffin-stimulated saliva samples, ms and lactobacilli were estimated by conventional viable counts on modified mitis-salivarius agar (msb) and rogosa agar plates, and by inoculation of dentocult sm and dentocult lb dip-slides (orion diagnostica, finland). the salivary ms and lactobacilli counts  obtained from conventional agar plates were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the dip-slide estimates of these organisms (kendal tau = 0.56, 0.71 respectively). subjects in group 2 showed the highest proportion (77 per cent) of individuals with salivary ms levels above 2.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml saliva; 99 per cent  of that group had detectable levels of lactobacilli. significantly different median salivary ms and lactobacilli levels were demonstrated between all groups except for lactobacilli levels between groups 2 and 3. these dip-slide tests provided suitable and simple methods for screening salivary lactobacilli and ms levels which may have a useful role in the assessment of caries risk.

TI  == streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in patients with cancer.
AB  == eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at institut jules bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. the incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by streptococcus angionosus, streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (a, b, c, and g). twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. one-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microl). only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal  adult respiratory distress syndrome. the source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. no unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one s. mitis and one e. faecium. no relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.

TI  == expression of streptococcus mutans gtf genes in streptococcus milleri.
AB  == the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes gtfb and gtfc were ligated into escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into  streptococcus milleri. gtfb transformant ksb8 formed an s. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular gtf-i, of 158 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-is, of 158 and 135 kda. gtfc transformant ksc43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular gtf-si, of 146 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-sis, of 146 and 152 kda. the extracellular gtfs from ksb8 and ksc43 were purified and characterized. the two types of gtf also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well  as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three-  to sixfold) by the addition of dextran t10 and were inhibited in the presence of  1.5 m ammonium sulfate. the km(s) for sucrose and the optimal phs were also similar for both enzymes. however, when the transformants were grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, ksc43 cells, expressing gtf-si activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while ksb8 cells, expressing gtf-i  activity, did not. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of  the gtfb and gftc genes in s. mutans cariogenicity.

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

AB  == a replica-plate assay was used to screen for the interaction of salivary molecules with dental plaque bacteria. bacterial colonies cultured from supragingival plaque on sheep-blood (sb) agar were replica-plated onto nitrocellulose membranes overlaying sb or mitis-salivarius agar. membranes with attached colonies were removed and incubated with 125i-amylase or 125i-proline-rich glycoprotein (prg). positive interactions were detected by autoradiography. only strains of streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus  bound amylase, and strains of a. viscosus bound prg. the results suggest that amylase and prg bind to selected species of aerobic dental plaque bacteria.

TI  == enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  == laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (msa) in the presence of increasing concentrations  of either na+ or k+ up to 500 mmol/l. strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of na+ than k+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. two strains of streptococcus mutans, ingbritt 162 and ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l, whereas there was a decrease with strain ingbritt 162. strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults  and children were isolated on modified msa containing known concentrations of na+ and k+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. the number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of na+ or k+ was increased  from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/l. greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to na+ than to k+. half of the isolates were members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg), either streptococcus mitis or s. sanguis ii, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of na+ or k+ than other isolates that were identified as streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus acidominimus, and streptococcus milleri.

TI  == human leukocyte antigens in relation to colonization by mutans streptococci in the oral cavity.
AB  == mutans streptococci are well established as caries-inducing microorganisms in man. most humans carry the bacteria, but in highly different numbers. this cannot be explained by environmental factors only. the aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between levels of colonization by mutans streptococci and the presence of certain b and dr human leukocyte antigens (hla). altogether, 170 subjects who had their hla antigens determined (76 renal transplant patients and 94 healthy blood donors) were selected for the investigation. paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were taken using the wooden spatula method with subsequent cultivation of mutans streptococci on mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates. an association between the absence of hla-dr 4 antigens and low, or undetectable, levels of mutans streptococci was found. this  was statistically significant for the immunosuppressed renal transplant subjects. the same trend was observed among the healthy blood donors.

TI  == a modified mitis salivarius medium for a caries diagnostic test.
AB  == a new medium, mskb, composed of mitis salivarius agar base, sorbitol, kanamycin sulfate and bacitracin, has been developed that is more selective for recovery of mutans streptococci (mutans) than the so called mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) medium. msb and mskb were compared for recovery and selectivity of mutans by plating saliva samples as well as pure cultures on both media. sixty saliva samples were plated and counted for mutans and non-mutans colonies. thirty-six samples had greater numbers of non-mutans on msb than on mskb, and 14 of the 36 had non-mutans colonies that could be visually confused with mutants. the recovery of mutans on mskb was approximately 13% less than on msb. the selectivity and recovery of msb and mskb were evaluated over 1-5 months of storage at 4 degrees c. streptococcus anginosus grew on msb after 1 month, but not on mskb. streptococcus milleri type 2 grew on both media after 4 months.

TI  == caries experience, periodontal treatment needs, salivary ph, and streptococcus mutans counts in a preadolescent down syndrome population.
AB  == the prevalence of dental caries and periodontal treatment needs in an institutionalized population with down syndrome was examined and the relationship between caries prevalence, salivary ph, and salivary levels of streptococcus mutans was studied. thirty-two children with down syndrome, aged 8 to 13, were compared with two control groups of similar age ranges: healthy children and non-down mentally retarded (mr) children living in the same institution as the down syndrome population. the gender ratio mixtures in each group also matched the study sample. caries experience as indicated by decayed, missing, and filled  surfaces (dmf-s) showed significantly lower mean scores for the down syndrome group compared with both control groups. a similar pattern was found when evaluating the mean numbers of decayed surfaces. streptococcus mutans counts, expressed as number of colony-forming units on mitis salivarius agar plates among the down syndrome group, were the lowest, although not statistically significant  compared with the counts of the healthy children. both groups had bacterial counts which were significantly lower than those of the mr group. significant differences between the two institutionalized groups and the healthy group were recorded for the salivary ph levels. the periodontal treatment needs as evaluated by the community periodontal index of treatment needs showed significant difference between the mr group versus both the healthy population and the down syndrome group. on the whole, 84% of the down syndrome children were cariesfree.

TI  == ecology of viridans streptococci in the oral cavity and pharynx.
AB  == recently published taxonomic studies of viridans streptococci have resulted in several changes in the nomenclature and definition of oral streptococcal species. with this background, the ecology of streptococci in the oropharyngeal cavities was reinvestigated. the results based on the examination of 1426 streptococcal isolates confirmed and extended earlier findings. apart from mature supragingival plaque, which contained a mixture of all orally encountered streptococci, each site showed a characteristic streptococcal flora. initial dental plaque formation is primarily associated with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1  and streptococcus oralis. our investigation showed that s. sanguis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most prominent streptococci, also on buccal mucosa. in contrast, s. oralis was almost exclusively found in initial dental plaque. streptococcus gordonii, formerly part of s. sanguis, was found in small numbers on the oropharyngeal mucosa and in mature supragingival plaque. the dorsum of the tongue was dominated by s. mitis biovar 2 and streptococcus salivarius, the latter of which was predominant also on the pharyngeal mucosa. streptococcus anginosus was by far the most predominant streptococcus in subgingival plaque. immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) protease-producing streptococci were primarily isolated  from initial dental plaque and from the buccal mucosa. this lends further support to the concept of iga1 proteases being important for the ability of streptococci  to evade the local immune defence during their initial colonization of certain oral surfaces.

AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == streptococcus mutans, not detected?
AB  == the growth of streptococcus mutans was followed for three years in 24 healthy 12-17 year-old children, who were selected for the study on the basis of undetectable levels of salivary s. mutans. the saliva samples were cultured by a  dip-slide method based on mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with sucrose and bacitracin. at the final occasion, additional examination of plaque and saliva of 10 children using tsy20b agar was performed. during the 3-year study period, s. mutans was found in saliva samples from 15 children on one or more of the 4 test  occasions, suggesting that most 's. mutans negative individuals' were those in whom s. mutans could not be temporarily detected. the additional examination of plaque did not increase the number of 's. mutans-positive individuals'.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

TI  == association of viridans group streptococci from pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis and upper genital tract infection.
AB  == the prevalence and role of viridans group streptococci in the female genital tract have not been well described. in this study of 482 pregnant women, 147 (30%) were culture positive for viridans group streptococci. of 392 women with predominant lactobacillus morphotypes by gram stain (normal), 110 (28%) were colonized with viridans group streptococci, compared with 37 (41%) of 90 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) (p = 0.02). to determine whether any species were associated with bv, 177 consecutively isolated viridans group streptococci from the vagina were identified to the species level by using the facklam scheme. the  most frequently isolated species from the vagina was streptococcus intermedius (13%), followed by streptococcus acidominimus (6%), streptococcus constellatus (5%), streptococcus sanguis ii (4%), streptococcus mitis (2%), streptococcus salivarius (2%), streptococcus morbillorum (2%), streptococcus sanguis i (1%), streptococcus mutans (0.2%), and streptococcus uberis (0.2%) with an average of 1.2 species per woman. the distribution of the species among women with bv compared with normal women was not significantly different, with the exception of two species which were associated with bv: s. acidominimus (18% versus 3%, p less than 0.001) and s. morbillorum (6% versus 0.7%, p = 0.005). amniotic fluid and placenta cultures yielded 54 isolates: s. sanguis ii (13 isolates), s. acidominimus (9 isolates), s. intermedius (10 isolates), s. constellatus (3 isolates), s. mitis (4 isolates), s. sanguis i (4 isolates), s. morbillorum (5 isolates), s. mutans (2 isolates), s. uberis (1 isolate), mannitol-positive s. intermedius (1 isolate), and 2 isolates which were not classified. the distribution of species isolated from the upper genital tract was not a reflection of the distribution in the lower genital tract. dextran-producing species of viridans group streptococci may have a greater pathogenic potential in the placenta than the non-dextran-producing species.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == in-vitro adherence of oral streptococci in the presence of sucrose and its relationship to cariogenicity in the rat.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis i gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did strep. sanguis ii (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. there was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between streptococcus rattus/streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and strep. rattus/streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of streptococcus cricetus or strep. sobrinus and strep. mutans. the rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than streptococcus salivarius greater than streptococcus milleri greater than strep. sanguis greater than streptococcus faecalis greater than streptococcus mitis greater than streptococcus lactis. there was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of strep. mitis and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). on comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased  the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).

TI  == microbiology of the early colonization of human enamel and root surfaces in vivo.
AB  == this study describes the predominant early microflora on human teeth on the basis of microbiologic identification of 1742 fresh isolates. the isolates were obtained from four dental students who carried test pieces of enamel and root surface in the oral cavity for 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. during the experimental periods oral hygiene was discontinued. under equal conditions root surfaces were  more heavily colonized than were enamel surfaces. however, the composition of the microbiota was the same. within the first 24 h the microflora was dominated by streptococci and gram-positive pleomorphic rods. s. sanguis contributed only 6-18% of the early colonizers whereas s. mitis and s. oralis varied between 24-42% and 1-27% (mean values), respectively. the relative proportion of s. oralis increased significantly within the observation period while the proportion of s. salivarius and arginine-positive s. mitis showed a declining tendency. actinomyces species adsorbed to the tooth surfaces within the first 4 h but did not increase their relative proportions until after 8-12 h, possibly due to a long doubling time. in one individual, encapsulated bacteria resembling stomatococcus mucilaginosus were observed among the early colonizers. the time-dependent shifts in the bacterial populations within 24 h corroborate parallel ultrastructural findings.

TI  == differential medium for mixed cultures of alpha-hemolytic streptococci from blood.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic streptococci (ahs) were isolated from blood cultures from 100 patients, and species were identified by the ruoff and kunz scheme. when isolates were inoculated onto sheep blood agar, all 100 cultures appeared to be pure, with identifications based on colonial morphology and gram stain. when isolates were subcultured onto mitis salivarius agar (msa), mixtures of two species of ahs were detected in 10 cultures from patients (10%). these mixed cultures would have been reported as pure cultures of streptococcus milleri (six cultures), streptococcus  salivarius (three cultures), streptococcus sanguis i (one culture), with identifications based on biochemical profiles. cultures on msa demonstrated s. milleri (six cultures), streptococcus mitis (five cultures), s. salivarius (three cultures), s. sanguis i (one culture), and s. sanguis ii (five cultures). the inability to separate ahs species by colony morphology on sheep blood agar demands that a differential medium such as msa be routinely used for subculture.  failure to use such a medium may account for some of the confusing biochemical profiles associated with ahs species identification.

TI  == a simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

TI  == comparative recovery of streptococcus mutans on five isolation media, including a new simple selective medium.
AB  == for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, several selective media have been developed, of which mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) is the most widely used (gold et al., 1973). recently, the trypticase yeast-extract cystine agar medium (tyc, de stoppelaar et al., 1967) was modified into a selective medium for s. mutans, called trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin  (tycsb, van palenstein helderman et al., 1983). the aim of this study was to compare the recovery of s. mutans from clinical samples on mitis-salivarius agar  (ms), msb, tyc, and tycsb. further, a new simple selective medium for s. mutans was introduced. this medium, called tsy20b, was supposed to have the same qualities as tycsb, but its preparation is less laborious. one hundred eighty-five plaque and saliva samples from 37 subjects were plated on ms, msb, tyc, and tycsb, and 285 samples from 23 subjects were plated on tycsb and tsy20b. all plates were incubated at 37 degrees c in a 91% n2, 5% co2, 4% h2 atmosphere for five days. the s. mutans counts on tyc and tycsb were significantly higher than on ms or msb by almost a factor of 10. seventy-seven percent of the samples  gave higher s. mutans counts on tycsb than on msb. especially, samples with high  s. mutans d/g numbers gave lower s. mutans counts on msb. these data clearly indicate that msb agar is inhibitory for s. mutans and should not be used. an additional advantage of tycsb over msb agar is the possibility of distinguishing  s. mutans serotypes d/g from other serotypes.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  == forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. we calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective rogosa sl agar and s. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those  remaining caries-free. isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. the presence or absence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only s. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. however, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were  to become carious. analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.

AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == viridans streptococci in infective endocarditis: species distribution and susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (non-groupable) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reactions to a series of biochemical tests, including acid production in lactose, inulin, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 450  strains was isolated from blood cultures, 183 of which were from confirmed cases  of subacute endocarditis. the latter were identified as follows (%): streptococcus sanguis i (25.7), s. mitis (19.7), s. sanguis ii (19.7), s. mutans  (17.5), s. milleri (12), s. morbillorium (3.2) and s. salivarius (2.2). susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 129 of these strains: 68% were susceptible to all drugs tested, 20% were resistant only to tetracycline, 4% only to penicillin (mic = 0.5-4 micrograms ml-1) and 8% were multiply resistant (tetracycline, macrolides and related drugs, chloramphenicol, penicillin, high-level resistance to kanamycin and/or streptomycin [mic = 1000-80.00 micrograms ml-1].

TI  == glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar. combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of s. mutans colonies. candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish s. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic s. mutans serotype representatives and fresh  clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) formulations and mitis salivarius, msb, and blood agars. mitis salivarius  counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on msb were distinctly lower. a formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 u of bacitracin per ml (hence gstb), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on msb. the medium yielded readily recognized s. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with i2 reagent. freshly isolated serotype c, e, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. a study of 300 salivary samples revealed gstb to give significantly higher recoveries than msb. about 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for s. mutans with msb, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for s. mutans with msb. recovery of background flora on gstb was as low or lower than on msb, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. thus, gstb agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated s. mutans on msb agar.

AB  == whole cells of representative strains of oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) were radiolabeled by the lactoperoxidase method of radioiodination. the labeled polypeptides obtained by extraction of whole cells with boiling sodium dodecyl sulfate were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. of the total radioactivity, ca. 70% was  released by treating whole cells with trypsin, suggesting that the labeling was confined to proteins located on the cell surface. most s. sanguis strains studied gave a characteristic banding pattern consisting of a high-molecular-weight (120,000 [120k] to 63k) group of six proteins. three low-molecular-weight (12k, 16k, and 18k) proteins were also detected in many strains.

TI  == comparison of two screening tests for streptococcus mutans and evaluation of their suitability for mass screenings and private practice.
AB  == two simple microbiological tests for quantitating salivary streptococcus mutans levels were compared with each other and evaluated for suitability for mass screenings and private practice. both tests use mitis salivarius medium with bacitracin (msb) and are selective for s. mutans. one test estimates colonies grown on agar (msba) and the other estimates colonies grown in broth that adhere  to glass (msbb). both are scored from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). children (293) in grades 5 and 6 in tallahassee, florida (nonfluoridated) were tested for s. mutans levels. scores of children by both tests were significantly similar (chi 2, regression and kappa statistical analysis). correlation coefficients (regression) between scores and dmfs increments of the previous 4 yr were 0.35 (msba) and 0.26 (msbb). both tests were very good in identifying children with low caries increments, but positive scores did not correlate well with high caries increments. sampling and interpreting took 2 min (msba) and 1 min (msbb).  cost of msba/child was $1.15, and msbb/child $1.25. these tests are economical and suitable for mass screenings to identify low risk populations who do not require preventive treatment.

TI  == exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  == colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin a (iga) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. surprisingly, colostral iga agglutinated our control organism, brucella abortus.  low levels of colostral or milk igm and igg antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. fractionation on sepharose 4b indicated that 11s secretory iga is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including b. abortus. no evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.

AB  == streptococcus mutans mt6801 , mt6861 , and mt6879 , which form large mucoid colonies on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from a mother and her two daughters. these isolates were identified as serotype c by immunodiffusion with serotype-specific antisera. the large colonies formed on sucrose-containing agar  were found to contain water-soluble fructan . the cell-free fructosyltransferase  ( ftase ) activity of the strains which formed large colonies was five to eight times higher than that of serotype c s. mutans which produced small, rough colonies typical of this serotype. furthermore, greater quantities of fructan were synthesized from sucrose by growing cells of mt6801 when compared with mt8148 , a typical serotype c s. mutans. glucosyltransferase and ftase could be isolated by chromatofocusing from culture supernatants of mt6801 and mt8148 . the ftase activity of both strains was eluted at ph 4.5, and glucosyltransferase was  released by elution with an nacl linear gradient. the eluted ftase activity of mt6801 was significantly higher than that of mt8148 . strains mt6861 and mt6879 were also found to possess a similar property in terms of ftase activity. these results suggest that formation of large mucoid colonies by these strains is a consequence of high ftase activity.

TI  == slide-scoring method for estimation of streptococcus mutans levels in saliva.
AB  == a method was developed to facilitate the estimation of s. mutans levels in saliva. paraffin-stimulated saliva was poured on a special slide coated with mitis-salivarius-sucrose agar. two discs containing bacitracin (5 micrograms) were placed on the inoculated slide and the growth density of s. mutans around the bacitracin discs was scored after incubation in candle jars at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the obtained score values correlated well with the numbers of cfu of s. mutans per 1 ml of saliva estimated by a conventional method using mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. the experimental method was further tested by incubating the slides in an atmosphere created by co2-generating tables that were placed into the cover tubes of the slides. these score values were similar to those after conventional incubation. the method is suggested for epidemiologic studies and in selecting persons at high risk for caries and in controlling the effectiveness of prophylactic measures of these patients.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == fluorogenic selective and differential medium for isolation of fecal streptococci.
AB  == of 44 fluorogenic substrates tested for their ability to differentiate species of fecal streptococci, four yielded species-differentiating reactions. the remaining substrates either yielded uniformly positive, negative, or variable strain-dependent reactions. one substrate, 4-methylumbelliferone-alpha-d-galactoside, was hydrolyzed by streptococcus bovis  and s. faecium and its biotypes. 4-methylumbelliferone-alpha-d-galactoside and a  colorimetric starch substrate were incorporated into the fecal streptococcal selective medium of donnelly and hartman (appl. environ. microbiol. 35:576-581, 1978). three phenotypic groups were identifiable on the new fluorescent gentamicin-thallous-carbonate agar: (i) starch hydrolysis and fluorescence (s. bovis), (ii) no starch hydrolysis but fluorescence (s. faecium and its biotypes), and (iii) no starch hydrolysis or fluorescence (s. faecalis, s. avium, s. equinus, s. mitis, and s. salivarius). of the presumptive identifications from sewage, swine, and bovine samples, 86% were confirmed as being correct. the new medium has potential application in water, food, environmental, and possibly clinical microbiology.

TI  == the clinical significance of streptococcal species isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == alpha-hemolytic (viridans) streptococci are often isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (csf); however, the significance of such isolates is poorly understood. in  order to clarify the clinical significance of isolating these organisms from csf, we did a retrospective analysis of 43 patients, from whom eight different species of alpha-hemolytic streptococci were recovered. eight patients (19%) had significant infections based on bacteriologic, laboratory, and clinical findings. significant infections were associated with s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. intermedius, s. faecalis, and s. bovis. thirty-five patient isolates (81%) from csf were considered as contaminants, with s. mitis being the most frequently isolated organism (49%). direct gram stain of csf sediment, csf glucose concentration, and csf cell differential were clearly abnormal in most patients with significant infections, in contrast to patients with streptococci isolated as contaminants. cultures of the lumbar puncture skin site yielded streptococci and other bacteria, suggesting a possible reservoir for contaminants.

TI  == prevalence of streptococcus mutans with different colonial morphologies in human  plaque and saliva.
AB  == plaque and saliva samples were obtained twice from 58 children at an interval of  1 year and examined for the prevalence of streptococcus mutans on mitis salivarius (ms) and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar. two types of s. mutans colonies with different colonial morphologies were seen on both media. they were serologically identified as serotypes c/e/f and d/g respectively. the first type, morphogroup c/e/f, had the typical "frosted-glass" appearance. it was the most prevalent and was found in 97% of the children. the second type, morphogroup d/g, had a creamy marzipan consistency with a dull, granular surface, gray to brown in color and often with some liquid around or on top of the colony. group d/g was detected in 21 children (36%) and then together with colonies of group c/e/f. children infected with single or multiple morphogroups of s. mutans  generally harbored the same groups 1 year later. there was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of s. mutans in plaque and their numbers in saliva.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

AB  == a method for the speciation of viridans streptococci (devoided of group antigens) is described. the major identification criteria are based on the reaction of a series of biochemical tests such as acid production in lactose, inuline, raffinose, mannitol and sorbitol, hydrolysis of arginine, esculin and na hippurate, and production of polysaccharides in 5% sucrose media. a total of 460  strains were isolated from human specimens and identified as follows: 118 streptococcus mitis, 102 s. sanguis ii, 75 s. sanguis i, 87 s. milleri (streptococcus mg-intermedius), 28 s. mutans, 25 s. salivarius, 14 s. morbillorium, 2 s. uberis and 9 unspeciated. susceptibility to antibiotics was studied for 318 strains: 63% of them were susceptible to all drugs tested; 37% of the strains were resistant to one or several antibiotics as follows: 34% to tetracycline, 8.5% to macrolides and related drugs, 5.3% to streptomycin and/or kanamycin (mic greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml), 5% to penicillin (mic = 1-4 micrograms/ml) and 4% to chloramphenicol.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

AB  == bacteria in culture medium at 37 degrees c were subjected to eight puffs of smoke from one cigarette, and viable cell counts were done at intervals ranging from 0  min to 3 h after exposure to smoke. the cigarette contained 23.0 mg of tar and 1.4 mg of nicotine. each 25.0 ml puff of smoke from a mechanical smoking apparatus was passed over a 1.0 ml suspension of bacteria dispersed over a 25 cm2 surface in a sterile flask. filtered air was in contact with the suspension between puffs, and during the intervals between smoke treatment and viable cell counts being done. there was a marked decrease in numbers of viable branhamella catarrhalis at 15 min after exposure to smoke, and by 1 h there were no viable cells in suspensions which originally contained 10(7) bacteria. no reduction in the number of viable branhamella catarrhalis occurred in an untreated suspension  of the micro-organism. there was a marked decrease in viable neisseria perflava at 30 min, and by 3 h there were no viable cells. there was a 4 to 5 log10 reduction of viable neisseria sicca compared with untreated bacteria at 3 h after exposure to smoke. streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis were less susceptible to the harmful action of cigarette smoke, and by 3 h there were 1 to 2 log10 differences in viable cell counts between smoke-treated and untreated bacteria. non-filter cigarette smoke had a greater detrimental effect on all species of bacteria studied than smoke from filter-tipped cigarettes.

TI  == studies on streptococci. i. distribution of fecal streptococci in man.
AB  == to understand the significance to the host of streptococci as part of the intestinal microflora, we first tried to investigate the distribution of human fecal streptococci on the species level. of the selective media compared, kmn agar was more effective than the other media for the isolation of streptococci from human feces. we made an effort to improve streptococcal classification. especially we used utilization of 1% pyruvate, 1% arginine, and 1% citrate for differentiation between streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium. in a tellurite tolerance test, s. faecalis was distinguished more clearly from s. faecium in the medium containing 0.16 or 0.32% tellurite. we devised methods of presumptive identification of fecal streptococci from the results of the characteristics of 1,442 isolates. these methods enabled us to identify many strains rapidly. different results in the distribution of species of streptococci between children and adults were observed. s. faecalis and s. faecium were isolated constantly from both groups. s. bovis and s. avium were isolated frequently from the feces of children. on the other hand, "viridans" streptococci, e.g. s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. mg-intermedius were present at a high frequency in, and no s. avium  could be isolated from, the feces of adults.

TI  == virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if populations of streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. s. mutans strain jbp (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for  antibody analyses. isolates derived from stock cultures of strain jbp proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. however, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and  the terminal ph attained in glucose broth. some isolates obtained 12 weeks after  infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin a (iga) antibodies reactive with whole jbp cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced  to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. significantly higher levels of  iga antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain jbp for 3 weeks or longer. thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of s. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary iga antibodies. the reactivity of salivary igg with jbp cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. no antibodies of the igm class were  detected. when tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain jbp in inducing carious lesions. prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum iga antibodies reactive with strain jbp, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats.  it is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == extractability of cell wall polysaccharide from lactobacilli and streptococci by  autoclaving and by dilue acid.
AB  == autoclaving cell wall of streptococcus mutans ingbritt for 15 min under the rantz and randall conditions released one-tenth of the total cell wall carbohydrate, whereas two-thirds was extracted after autoclaving for 180 min. the extract contained the serotype c-specific antigen but lacked the lipoteichoic acid component extracted when whole cells were autoclaved. autoclaving cell wall preparations from other strains of s. mutans and also streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis in 0.85% nacl for 180 min released the major proportion of the wall polysaccharide fraction. approximately 50 to 90% of wall carbohydrate of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus casei was released when cell wall preparations were autoclaved in 0.85% nacl for 180 min. for wall preparations from several strains of s. mutans, autoclaving for 60 min at ph 3.75 released only 39 to 62% of wall carbohydrate, whereas almost total release could be achieved with the lactobacilli. heating s. mutans ingbritt cell wall for 24 h at  60 degrees c in 0.1 n h(2)so(4) released only two-thirds of the wall carbohydrate; by comparison nearly all of the wall carbohydrate was released in 3 h from l. casei and l. fermentum. autoclaving l. casei cell wall and purified soluble wall fractions hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond between the polysaccharide and peptidoglycan. this was shown by the release of reactive n-acetylhexosamine in both cases and the presence of a phosphomonoester in the autoclaved soluble wall fractions. the results indicate that autoclaving can hydrolyze covalent linkages, and this must be considered when the rantz and randall procedure is used to obtain antigen preparations.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

TI  == comparative recovery of streptococcus mutans on ten isolation media.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus mutans (bratthall serotypes a through e) to grow on  10 isolation media was examined. the number and morphology of the colonies were observed to vary on different media. the use of blood-sucrose media consistently  produced the highest recoveries. mitis salivarius agar (ms) and higher recovery values than modified medium 10 (mm10sb), trypticase-yeast extract-cystine medium  (tyc), or ms with 1% tellurite (mst). mst with 40% sucrose (ms40s), mst with 20%  sucrose and 0.2 u of bacitracin per ml (msb), and carlsson medium with 1% sulfasoxazole (mc), media formulated for the selection of s. mutans, were the most inhibitory for all serotypes. the morphology of several s. mutans strains was atypical on mc and ms40s, making positive identification difficult. absence of growth of serotype a strains on msb and serotype d strains on mc were the two  major differences observed among the serotypes. results are discussed in terms of the difficulties in making quantitative determinations from cultural data.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == determinants of the developing oral flora in normal newborns.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus species to selectively adhere to the oral epithelial cells of newborns was studied in vitro. on day 1 of life, mucosal cells from normal infants demonstrated selective attraction for the natural distribution of  streptococci that would soon colonize these surfaces. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis adhered well in vitro to scraped cells from cheek and tongue surfaces. streptococcus mutans, on the other hand, exhibited feeble or no  adherence to cheek or tongue cells. adherence of escherichia coli to oral epithelial cells was also studied. the ability of strains of e. coli to adhere to cheek and tongue cells correlated solely with the presence of cell surface substances, probably pili. these observations, made on infants at the critical moment of their developing flora, strengthen the hypothesis that the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is an important determinant of their ecological place in the oral microflora.

TI  == properties of a mutant of streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == a mutant of streptococcus mutans gs-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. this mutant, designated sng-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose.  however, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. the inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. in addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the  parental activity. the reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of  the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. however, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in  terms of ph and temperature optima and km values for sucrose. the mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. these results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by s. mutans.

"mitis" after subculture on ms-agar as soon as visible growth had appeared in the broth media and again after a further 2 days. the following observations were made: 1. strep. salivarius was almost regularly found in either or both of tas- and blh-medium at primary culture of the samples contaminated with saliva. the result was the same whether these broth media were inoculated directly or via vmg iii. 2. strep. salivarius was always found in mixed cultures  and was nearly always accompanied by strep. sanguis and/or strep. "mitis". 3. strep. salivarius as well as strep. sanguis survived two days after visible growth significantly more oftern in blh-medium than in tas-medium. the findings lend support to the hypothesis based on clinical studies that when present in root canal cultures strep. salivarius is ascribable to contamination with saliva.

AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.

TI  == laboratory studies with a selective enterococcus medium.
AB  == lancefield group d streptococci are involved with appreciable frequency in a variety of infectious processes. the presumptive recognition of these bacteria on initial culturing of clinical specimens is an objective not attained readily by selective media available in the clinical laboratory. selective enterococcus agar was evaluated with emphasis on its ability to sequester enterococci from specimens with many microbial components. in addition, the sensitivity of this new agar was compared with trypticase soy agar containing sheep blood and mitis salivarius agar. all enterococci isolated from clinical material were classified  in accordance with accepted biochemical and immunochemical criteria. the enterococci grew on the new medium as distinctive colonies surrounded by a black  zone. only listeria monocytogenes presented similar colonial morphology after 48  hr. most other bacteria did not grow at all or appeared markedly different. the sensitivity of the new agar was of the same order of magnitude as on blood or mitis-salivarius agars, but its selectivity was superior.

TI  == use of a methylene blue azide medium for isolation of enterococci.
AB  == a methylene blue azide medium (mba), developed by schaedler, dubos, and costello  to isolate enterococci from the gastrointestinal tract of animals, was evaluated. this was done by comparing the isolation of enterococci from feces and saliva on  the medium. fifty-two catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci from human feces isolated from mba were classified as enterococci. all strains grew in s f, 6.5% nacl, and streptomycin broths, and all fermented mannitol. the isolates were provisionally subdivided into streptococcus faecalis and s. faecium groups. s. faecalis-like strains fermented glycerol and pyruvate aerobically and produced acid in snyder's medium (initial ph, 4.8). the s. faecium group fermented raffinose. among all strains, several tests were variable. these included growth  at 45 c, in 0.1% tellurite and in methylene blue milk. three methods were employed to isolate and identify enterococci from the oral cavity. direct streaking of mba with saliva failed to produce any growth on the medium. two other methods, with the use of various selective broths to promote the recovery of oral enterococci, failed to produce any bacteria capable of growing on mba. the mba-isolated fecal strains and oral viridans streptococci were generally indistinguishable on mitis-salivarius and k f agars. in experiments with fecal material, no gram-negative bacilli were found among the isolates selected. the mba medium was judged as a high selectivity-low yield medium, and may provide a means of separating fecal and nonfecal enterococci.
