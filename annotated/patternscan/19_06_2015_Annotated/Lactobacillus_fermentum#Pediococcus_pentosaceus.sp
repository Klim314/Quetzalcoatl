TI  == flavour formation from hydrolysis of pork sarcoplasmic protein extract by a unique lab culture isolated from harbin dry sausage.
AB  == the lactic acid bacteria pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus curvatus, and lactobacillus fermentum isolated from harbin dry sausage were assessed for their protein hydrolysis and flavour development in pork muscle sarcoplasmic protein extracts. gel electrophoresis indicated that sarcoplasmic proteins were degraded by all of the strains, especially by p. pentosaceus and l. curvatus. trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides increased in all of the samples (p < 0.05), especially samples inoculated with p. pentosaceus. samples inoculated with p. pentosaceus and l. curvatus had higher free amino acid contents than did the other two strains(p < 0.05), and glutamic acid and alanine  appeared to be the predominant free amino acids. the volatile compound analysis indicated that the highest aldehydes, alcohols and acid contents were found in the sample with p. pentosaceus followed by l. curvatus. the results revealed that p. pentosaceus could be appropriate for use as a meat starter culture.

TI  == assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  == probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (lab). in this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., and oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. the assays included two probiotic reference strains (lactobacillus  plantarum clc 17 and lactobacillus fermentum cect5716). the lactobacillus and pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/l of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and  were capable of surviving at low ph values (ph 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. the ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. adhesion levels of enological lab to caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. in particular, pediococcus pentosaceus cial-86 showed a  high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against e. coli cial-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine lab strain as a potential probiotic.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic characterization of some lactic acid bacteria isolated from bee pollen: a preliminary study.
AB  == in the present work, five hundred and sixty-seven isolates of lactic acid bacteria were recovered from raw bee pollen grains. all isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. neutralized supernatants of 54 lactic acid bacteria (lab) cultures from 216 active isolates inhibited the growth of indicator bacteria. they were phenotypically characterized, based on the fermentation of 39 carbohydrates. using the simple matching coefficient and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages (upgma), seven clusters with other two members were defined at the 79% similarity level. the following species were characterized: lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus, and unidentified lactobacilli. phenotypic characteristics of major and minor clusters were also identified. partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene of representative isolates from each cluster was performed, and ten strains were assigned to seven species:  lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus ingluviei, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus acidipiscis and weissella cibaria. the molecular method used failed to determine the exact taxonomic status of bh0900 and ah3133.

TI  == a description of the lactic acid bacteria microbiota associated with the production of traditional fermented vegetables in vietnam.
AB  == an important part of the daily nourishment in vietnam constitutes of fermented vegetables. bacteria and especially lactic acid bacteria play a central role in the production of many fermented vegetables. the current study was conducted to investigate the diversity of native lactic acid bacteria (lab) populations in 'dua muoi' (mustard and beet fermentation) and 'ca muoi' (eggplant fermentation), three types of popular traditional fermented vegetables of vietnamese origin. to  this end a polyphasic approach combining matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and phes gene sequence analysis was used. in addition, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed as a culture-independent method to complement the observed culturable diversity data. a total of 881 lab isolates were recovered from 21 different samples. predominant lab associated with 'dua muoi' and 'ca muoi' were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (56.6%), lactobacillus pentosus  (24.4%) and lactobacillus plantarum (17.1%). less abundant species were pediococcus pentosaceus (1.0%) and lactobacillus brevis (0.5%). species present less than 0.1% included lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus pantheris and pediococcus acidilactici. in contrast to fermented mustard and beet with the highest prevalence of l. fermentum, the species most recovered from fermented eggplant samples was l. pentosus. in addition, an important degree of genetic variability within the different predominant species was observed and strain dependency correlating with the type of fermented vegetable or location of production could be demonstrated using multivariate statistics. this research gives an extensive and detailed inventory of the lab diversity associated with the production of diverse vietnamese fermented vegetables and demonstrates the influence of type of raw material and/or production location and conditions on this diversity.

TI  == the dominant microbial community associated with fermentation of obushera (sorghum and millet beverages) determined by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  == obushera includes four fermented cereal beverages from uganda namely: obutoko, enturire, ekitiribita and obuteire, whose microbial diversity has not hitherto been fully investigated. knowledge of the microbial diversity and dynamics in these products is crucial for understanding their safety and development of appropriate starter cultures for controlled industrial processing. culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques including denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and mixed dna sequencing of polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplified ribosomal rna genes were used to study the bacteria and  yeast diversity of obushera. the ph dropped from 6.0-4.6 to 3.5-4.0 within 1-2 days for obutoko, enturire and obuteire whereas that of ekitiribita decreased to  4.4 after 4 days. counts of lactic acid bacteria (lab) increased from 5.0 to 11.0 log cfug(-1) and yeasts increased from 3.4 to 7.1 log cfug(-1) while coliform counts decreased from 2.0 to <1 log cfug(-1) during four days of fermentation. lab and yeast isolates were identified by rrna gene sequence analysis. lab isolates included: enterococcus spp., lactobacillus (lb.) plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus (s.) infantarius subsp. infantarius, pediococcus pentosaceus and weisella (w.) confusa. dgge indicated predominance of s. gallolyticus, s. infantarius subsp. infantarius, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, w. confusa, lb. reuteri, fructobacillus spp., l. lactis and l. lactis. yeast isolates included clavispora  lusitaniae, cyberlindnera fabianii, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyces cerevisiae. dgge indicated predominance of s. cerevisiae in obutoko, enturire and obuteire and also detected pichia spp. and i. orientalis in obutoko. obushera produced in the laboratory was initially dominated by enterobacteriaceae and later by lactococcus spp. enterobacteriaceae and bacillus spp. were also detected in ekitiribita. development of starters for obushera may require combinations of  lab and s. cerevisiae for obutoko, enturire and obuteire and lab for ekitiribita.

TI  == presence of erythromycin and tetracycline resistance genes in lactic acid bacteria from fermented foods of indian origin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) resistant to erythromycin were isolated from different food samples on selective media. the isolates were identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus lactis, enterococcus casseliflavus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and leuconostoc mesenteroides. of the total 60 isolates, 88 % harbored the ermb gene. the efflux gene msra was identified in e. faecium, e. durans, e. lactis, e. casseliflavus, p. pentosaceus  and l. fermentum. further analysis of the msra gene by sequencing suggested its homology to msrc. resistance to tetracycline due to the genes tetm, tetw, teto, tetk and tetl, alone or in combination, were identified in lactobacillus species. the tetracycline efflux genes tetk and tetl occurred in p. pentosaceus and enterococcus species. since it appeared that lab had acquired these genes, fermented foods may be a source of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and in situ amylase expression during traditional fermentation of cereal foods.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria play an important role in traditional fermented foods consumed in different countries. study of their taxonomic structure and diversity is necessary for starter culture selection, improved safety and nutritional enhancement. to achieve these objectives, microbial genomic typing methods were used to study genetic differences of autochthonous bacteria and their distribution in two traditional african fermented cereal foods. a total of 85 predominant bacterial species were isolated from ogi and kunu-zaki obtained from  northern and southern geographical region of nigeria. they were identified using  combination of 16s rrna gene sequencing, multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) based on rpoa, phes and atpa genes as well as m13-pcr gel fingerprints. the results showed that lactobacillus fermentum was the most frequently isolated species in ogi (71.4%) and kunu-zaki (84.5%). other species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) identified were lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. non lactic acid bacteria isolated from these foods were species belonging to the bacillus and staphylococcus. non-metric multidimensional scaling (nmds) analysis of the m13-pcr fingerprints for lab strains showed clonal diversity among strains of the same species. in vitro and in situ expression of amylase gene during fermentation by amylolytic l. plantarum ulag11 was detected, indicating the potential usefulness of such species for development of starter cultures and for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == genotypic characterization and safety assessment of lactic acid bacteria from indigenous african fermented food products.
AB  == background: indigenous fermented food products play an essential role in the diet of millions of africans. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are among the predominant microbial species in african indigenous fermented food products and are used for  different applications in the food and biotechnology industries. numerous studies have described antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of lab from different parts  of the world. however, there is limited information on antimicrobial resistance profiles of lab from africa. the aim of this study was to characterize 33 lab previously isolated from three different african indigenous fermented food products using (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, sequencing of the 16s rrna gene and species-specific pcr techniques for differentiation of closely related species and further evaluate their antibiotic resistance profiles by the broth microdilution method and their haemolytic activity on sheep blood agar plates as  indicators of safety traits among these bacteria. results: using molecular biology based methods and selected phenotypic tests such as catalase reaction, co2 production from glucose, colonies and cells morphology, the isolates were identified as lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus ghanensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella confusa. the bacteria were susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol,  clindamycin and erythromycin but resistant to vancomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin. variable sensitivity profiles to tetracycline and gentamicin was observed among the isolates with lb. plantarum, lb. salivarius, w. confusa (except strain sk9-5) and lb. fermentum strains being susceptible to tetracycline whereas pediococcus strains and lb. ghanensis strains were resistant. for gentamicin, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lb. ghanensis and ped. acidilactici strains were resistant to 64 mg/l whereas some w. confusa and lb. plantarum strains had a mic value of 16 mg/l and 32 mg/l respectively. no beta-haemolytic activity was observed, however, alpha-haemolytic activity was observed in 27% (9) of the strains comprising lb. salivarius (6), w. confusa (2) and lb. delbrueckii  (1) isolates. conclusions: the resistance to kanamycin and vancomycin is probably an intrinsic feature since similar observations were reported in the literature for lab. low prevalence of pathogenicity indicator traits were observed among the isolates especially with the presence of poor haemolytic activities and they could therefore be considered as interesting candidates for selection of starter  cultures or probiotics for different applications.

TI  == biodiversity of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria in the fermentation of "shanxi aged vinegar", a traditional chinese vinegar.
AB  == shanxi aged vinegar is a famous traditional chinese vinegar made from several kinds of cereal by spontaneous solid-state fermentation techniques. in order to get a comprehensive understanding of culturable microorganism's diversity present in its fermentation, the indigenous microorganisms including 47 yeast isolates, 28 lactic acid bacteria isolates and 58 acetic acid bacteria isolates were recovered in different fermenting time and characterized based on a combination of phenotypic and genotypic approaches including inter-delta/pcr, pcr-rflp, eric/pcr analysis, as well as 16s rrna and 26s rrna partial gene sequencing. in the alcoholic fermentation, the dominant yeast species saccharomyces (s.) cerevisiae (96%) exhibited low phenotypic and genotypic diversity among the isolates, while lactobacillus (lb.) fermentum together with lb. plantarum, lb. buchneri, lb. casei, pediococcus (p.) acidilactici, p. pentosaceus and weissella  confusa were predominated in the bacterial population at the same stage. acetobacter (a.) pasteurianus showing great variety both in genotypic and phenotypic tests was the dominant species (76%) in the acetic acid fermentation stage, while the other acetic acid bacteria species including a. senegalensis, a. indonesiensis, a. malorum and a. orientalis, as well as gluconobacter (g.) oxydans were detected at initial point of alcoholic and acetic acid fermentation  stage respectively.

TI  == antifungal activity of lactobacillus fermentum te007, pediococcus pentosaceus te010, lactobacillus pentosus g004, and l. paracasi d5 on selected foods.
AB  == in the search for new preservatives from natural resources to replace or to reduce the use of chemical preservatives 4 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab)  were selected to be evaluated for their antifungal activity on selected foods. the supernatants of the selected strains delayed the growth of fungi for 23 to 40 d at 4 degrees c and 5 to 6 d at 20 and 30 degrees c in tomato puree, 19 to 29 d  at 4 degrees c and 6 to 12 d at 20 and 30 degrees c in processed cheese, and 27 to 30 d at 4 degrees c and 12 to 24 d at 20 and 30 degrees c in commercial bread. the shelf life of bread with added lab cells or their supernatants were longer than normal bread. this study demonstrates that lactobacillus fermentum te007, pediococcus pentosaceus te010, l. pentosus g004, and l. paracasi d5 either the cells or their supernatants could be used as biopreservative in bakery products and other processed foods. practical application: the heat stability nature of the antifungal compounds produced by the lab isolates offers a promising application of l. fermentum te007, p. pentosaceus te010, l. pentosus g004, and l. paracasi d5 as biopreservative in bakery products or other processed foods to replace or reduce the use of chemical preservatives.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. while the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping  the intestinal microbiota is limited. in this study, lab were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in syria. a total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with  random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by comparative 16s rdna sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) analyses. thirty six different species of lactobacillus, enterococcus, streptococcus, weissella and pediococcus were identified. rapd and maldi-tof-ms patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. whereas some species were unique for one  source, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus fermentum, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. interestingly, identical rapd genotypes of l. plantarum, l. fermentum, l. brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis and p. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. diversity of rapd types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical  transfer of intestinal lab from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria from hussuwa, a traditional african fermented sorghum food.
AB  == the diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with hussuwa fermentation, a sudanese fermented sorghum food, was studied using a polyphasic taxonomical approach. predominant strains could be well characterised based on a combination  of phenotypic tests and genotypic methods such as ardra, rep-pcr and rapd-pcr, as well as 16s rrna gene sequencing of representative strains. thus, the majority (128 of 220, 58.3%) of strains exhibited phenotypic properties typical of heterofermentative lactobacilli and of these, 100 strains were characterised more closely using the genotyping methods. the majority (97/100) strains could be characterised as lactobacillus fermentum strains. seventy-two of 220 strains (32.7%) showed phenotypic properties that are characteristic of pediococci. of 41 selected strains investigated by genotyping techniques, 38 (92.7%) could be characterised as pediococcus acidilactici strains, while three (7.3%) could be characterised as pediococcus pentosaceus strains. the hussuwa fermentation thus appears to be dominated by l. fermentum strains and p. acidilactici strains. for  this reason, we selected representative and predominant strains as potential starter cultures for hussuwa fermentation. these strains, l. fermentum strains bfe 2442 and bfe 2282 and p. acidilactici strain bfe 2300, were shown on the basis of rapd-pcr fingerprinting to predominate in a model fermentation when used as starter cultures inoculated at 1 x 10(6) cfu/g and to lower the ph of the fermentation to below ph 4.0 within 48 h. these cultures should be studied for further development as starter preparations in pilot scale studies in actual field fermentations.

TI  == community dynamics of bacteria in sourdough fermentations as revealed by their metatranscriptome.
AB  == the lactic acid bacterial (lab) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related rna samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an lab functional gene microarray. to indicate the species  present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. the overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough lab species, including enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating lab species. compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides l. plantarum and l. fermentum. consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an lab functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems.

TI  == purification of bacterial genomic dna in less than 20 min using chelex-100 microwave: examples from strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from soil samples.
AB  == we established a chelex 100-microwave method for the purification of bacterial genomic dna (gdna) in less than 20 min with high yield and good quality, useful for multiple purposes. it combines chelex 100, proteinase k, rnase a and heating  in a microwave oven. the resulting gdna was used directly to identify bacterial species of the order lactobacillales by means of pcr amplification of their 16s rdna gene, isolated from sediments on the yucatan peninsula, mexico. this method  produced gdna free of phenolic and protein residual contaminants from 100 of these isolated bacteria. 16s rdna amplification and sequencing showed pediococcus acidilactici to prevail in inland lagoons, and pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sp., and lactobacillus fermentum to be most abundant in the soils of livestock farms. the combination of chelex 100, enzymes and microwave heating used in the chelex 100-microwave method produced large amounts of highly pure gdna from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria,  in less than 20 min.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria as reducing and capping agent for the fast and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.
AB  == there is a growing demand for silver-based biocides, including both ionic silver  forms and metallic nanosilver. the use of metallic nanosilver, typically chemically produced, faces challenges including particle agglomeration, high costs, and upscaling difficulties . additionally, there exists a need for the development of a more eco-friendly production of nanosilver. in this study, gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were utilized in the non-enzymatic production of silver nanoparticles via the interaction of silver ions and organic compounds present on the bacterial cell. only lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus spp., pediococcus pentosaceus, enterococcus faecium, and lactococcus garvieae, were able to reduce silver. the nanoparticles of the five best producing lactobacillus spp. were examined more into detail with transmission electron microscopy. particle localization inside the cell, the mean particle size, and size distribution were species dependent, with lactobacillus fermentum having the smallest mean particle size of 11.2 nm, the most narrow size distribution, and most nanoparticles associated with the outside of the cells. furthermore, influence of ph on the reduction process was investigated. with increasing ph, silver recovery increased as well as the reduction rate as indicated by uv-vis analyses. this study demonstrated that lactobacillus spp. can be used for a rapid and efficient production of silver nanoparticles.

TI  == selection and use of autochthonous mixed starter for lactic acid fermentation of  carrots, french beans or marrows.
AB  == strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, weissella soli/weissella koreensis, enterococcus faecalis, pediococcus pentosaceus and lactobacillus fermentum were identified from raw carrots, french beans and marrows by partial 16s rrna gene sequence. l. plantarum m1, leuc. mesenteroides c1 and p. pentosaceus f4 were selected based on the rates of growth and acidification in vegetable juice media, and used as the autochthonous mixed starter for the fermentation of carrots, french beans or marrows. an allochthonous starter, consisting of the same species, was also used for fermentation. a two-step fermentation process (1 day at 25 degrees c and 7 days at 15 degrees c) in brine (1% w/v) followed by storage at room temperature in olive oil until 40 days was set up. unstarted vegetables subjected to the same treatments were used as the controls. cell numbers of lactic acid bacteria in the started vegetables were ca. 10,000 (autochthonous starter) and 1000 (allochthonous starter) times higher than unstarted samples throughout the process. when fermented with the autochthonous starter, carrots, french beans or  marrows were characterized by the rapid decrease of ph (<4.5), marked consumption of fermentable carbohydrates, and inhibition of enterobacteriaceae and yeasts. fermentation with the allochthonous starter did not acidify and inhibit bacteria  and yeasts so rapidly. after 40 days, carrots, french beans and marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter had significantly (p<0.05) higher total concentration of vitamin c (ascorbate+dehydroascorbate) with respect to those fermented with the allochthonous starter and, especially unstarted vegetables. the same was found for the indexes of color. firmness of both started vegetables  was higher than unstarted vegetables. sensory analysis differentiated started vegetables. carrots and french beans fermented with the autochthonous starter were, especially, appreciated for fragrance. appearance was the sensory attribute that mainly distinguished marrows fermented with the autochthonous starter.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with gowe production from sorghum in benin.
AB  == aims: to identify the dominant micro-organisms involved in the production of gowe, a fermented beverage, and to select the most appropriate species for starter culture development. methods and results: samples of sorghum gowe produced twice at three different production sites were taken at different fermentation times. dna amplification by internal transcribed spacer-polymerase chain reaction of 288 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates and 16s rrna gene sequencing of selected strains revealed that the dominant lab responsible for gowe fermentation were lactobacillus fermentum, weissella confusa, lactobacillus  mucosae, pediococcus acidilactici, pediococcus pentosaceus and weissella kimchii. dna from 200 strains of yeasts was amplified and the d1/d2 domain of the 26s rrna gene was sequenced for selected isolates, revealing that the yeasts species were  kluyveromyces marxianus, pichia anomala, candida krusei and candida tropicalis. conclusions: gowe processing is characterized by a mixed fermentation dominated by lact. fermentum, w. confusa and ped. acidilactici for the lab and by k. marxianus, p. anomala and c. krusei for the yeasts. significance and impact of the study: the diversity of the lab and yeasts identified offers new opportunities for technology upgrading and products development in gowe production. the identified species can be used as possible starter for a controlled fermentation of gowe.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of non-enterococcal intrinsic glycopeptide-resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  == non-enterococcal gram-positive bacteria that are intrinsically vancomycin-resistant have been infrequently isolated in association with serious  infections. however, well-documented infections have lately been reported with increasing frequency. because these organisms may be pathogens, we tested the mics of 19 antimicrobial agents by the agar dilution method for predicting susceptibility. the activity of these antimicrobial agents was assessed against 28 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 6; lactobacillus acidophilus, 1; lactobacillus casei, 1; lactobacillus fermentum, 2; lactobacillus brevis, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1; weissella confusa, 2; leuconostoc mesenteroides, 7; leuconostoc lactis, 4; pediococcus acidilactici, 2; pediococcus pentosaceus, 1),  isolated from clinical specimens in an argentinian university hospital from 1997  to 2003. the mics of penicillin for 67% of the lactobacillus strains and 100% of  the leuconostoc spp. and pediococcus spp. strains tested were in the 0.25-2 microg/ml range. erythromycin was the most active antimicrobial overall. multiresistance was observed in 2 strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus, 1; lactobacillus plantarum, 1).

TI  == microbiological study of lactic acid fermentation of caper berries by molecular and culture-dependent methods.
AB  == fermentation of capers (the fruits of capparis sp.) was studied by molecular and  culture-independent methods. a lactic acid fermentation occurred following immersion of caper berries in water, resulting in fast acidification and development of the organoleptic properties typical of this fermented food. a collection of 133 isolates obtained at different times of fermentation was reduced to 75 after randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis. isolates were identified by pcr or 16s rrna gene sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (37 isolates), lactobacillus paraplantarum (1 isolate), lactobacillus pentosus (5 isolates), lactobacillus brevis (9 isolates), lactobacillus fermentum (6 isolates), pediococcus pentosaceus (14 isolates), pediococcus acidilactici (1  isolate), and enterococcus faecium (2 isolates). cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among lactobacilli (with four major  groups and five subgroups), while pediococci clustered in two closely related groups. a culture-independent analysis of fermentation samples by temporal temperature gradient electrophoresis (ttge) also indicated that l. plantarum is the predominant species in this fermentation, in agreement with culture-dependent results. the distribution of l. brevis and l. fermentum in samples was also determined by ttge, but identification of pediococcus at the species level was not possible. ttge also allowed a more precise estimation of the distribution of  e. faecium, and the detection of enterococcus casseliflavus (which was not revealed by the culture-dependent analysis). results from this study indicate that complementary data from molecular and culture-dependent analysis provide a more accurate determination of the microbial community dynamics during caper fermentation.

TI  == biodiversity of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains isolated from five sourdoughs.
AB  == aims: five different sourdoughs were investigated for the composition of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the biodiversity of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis strains. methods and results: a total of 57 strains were isolated from five sourdoughs. isolated strains were all identified by the 16s rdna sequence and species-specific primers for l. sanfranciscensis. results of identification showed that lab strains were l. sanfranciscensis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paralimentarius, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus pontis, lactobacillus casei, weisella confusa and pediococcus pentosaceus. a total of 21  strains were identified as l. sanfranciscensis and these isolates were detected in all five sourdoughs. ribotyping was applied to investigate the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis and sourdough. a total of 22 strains of l. sanfranciscensis including l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t were compared by ribotyping. the dendrogram of 21 ribotyping patterns showed four clusters, and l. sanfranciscensis jcm 5668t was independent of the others. the different biotypes of l. sanfranciscensis were present in two sourdoughs compared with other three sourdoughs. conclusions: the lab compositions of five sourdoughs were different and the relationship between intraspecies diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains and five sourdoughs was shown by ribotyping. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that ribotyping was useful for distinguishing l. sanfranciscensis strains. a further important result is that the intra-species diversity of l. sanfranciscensis strains seems to be related to the sourdough preparation.

TI  == microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour water, african spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
AB  == aims: to identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in koko and koko sour water (ksw) from different ghanaian production sites  with regard to pattern of fermentation (api 50 chl), genotype, antimicrobial activity, and resistance to low ph and bile salts. methods and results: in total  215 lab were isolated from koko and ksw. the isolates were identified using intergenic transcribed spacers (its)-pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), api 50 chl, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (rea-pfge) and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the dominating micro-organisms in koko was found to be weisella confusa and lactobacillus fermentum, followed by lact. salivarius and pediococcus spp. chemometric data analysis were used to link the lab species to the different production stages and production sites. at intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great  diversity. the isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. most isolates showed low levels of antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain listeria innocua, but not towards the bacteriocin-sensitive lact. sakei. growth of all lab isolates was unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. the isolates were able to survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to ph 2.5. conclusions: the dominating lab of koko and ksw were w. confusa and lact. fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level between stages within the production as well as between production sites. other species observed in ksw were lact. salivarius, ped. pentosaceus, ped. acidilactici and lact. paraplantarum. they occurred in levels of 108 cfu ml-1 in  fresh ksw and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance. significance and impact of the study: the present study gives a detailed picture  of the taxonomy and diversity of lab in an african-fermented millet product that  may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. the chemometric tools principal component analysis and anova partial least squares regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and ksw.

TI  == proteolytic activities in togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == proteolytic activities were investigated in sorghum-based togwa prepared by natural fermentation and using starter cultures previously isolated from the native product, i.e., lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, and issatchenkia orientalis in coculture with either l. brevis or l. plantarum. both  proteinase and aminopeptidase activities were substantially higher in naturally fermented togwa than in those with starters (14-30%, 12-70%, respectively). a variable but substantial part of the proteinase activity followed the particulate fraction of togwa; aminopeptidase activity was mainly in that fraction. the breakdown of relatively high molecular mass protein (64 kda) in togwa was detected by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page); the products were mainly in the 14-30 kda range. reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography (rp-fplc)-protein/peptide patterns changed during fermentation with some variation between togwa of different cultures. supplementation of gruel with malt increased the concentration of total protein [from 9.5% to 11.0% (w/w) on dry weight basis)] and of most of the free amino acids. fermentation had no effect on total protein content; however, the concentration of most of the amino acids was reduced, except for the proline content that increased. natural fermentation also increased the concentration of  glutamic acid and ornithine. fermentation by p. pentosaceus increased aspartic acid, while l. cellobiosus, l. fermentum, and l. brevis in coculture with i. orientalis increased the concentration of citrulline.

TI  == use of starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in the preparation of  togwa, a tanzanian fermented food.
AB  == starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum and pediococcus pentosaceus) and yeasts (candida pelliculosa, candida tropicalis, issatchenkia orientalis and saccharomyes cerevisiae) isolated from native togwa were tested singly or in combination for their ability to ferment maize-sorghum gruel to produce togwa. all species of bacteria showed an ability to ferment the gruel as  judged by lowering the ph from 5.87 to 3.24-3.49 and increasing the titratable acidity from 0.08% to 0.30-0.44% (w/w, lactic acid) in 24 h. yeasts used singly showed little activity within 12 h, but lowered the ph to 3.57-4.81 and increased the acidity to 0.11-0.21% in 24 h. yeasts in co-culture with lactic acid bacteria (lab) had a modest effect on the final acidity (p<0.05). the number of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts increased while the enterobacteriaceae decreased with fermentation time. the ph was lowered and lactic acid produced significantly (p<0.05) fastest in natural togwa fermentation and in samples fermented by l. plantarum or l. plantarum in co-culture with i. orientalis. the content of fermentable sugars was reduced during fermentation. most volatile flavour compounds were produced in samples from fermentation by p. pentosaceus and i. orientalis in co-culture with either l. plantarum or l. brevis.

TI  == microbiological and fermentation characteristics of togwa, a tanzanian fermented  food.
AB  == selected microbiological and metabolic characteristics of sorghum, maize, millet  and maize-sorghum togwa were investigated during natural fermentation for 24 h. the process was predominated by lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts. the mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts increased and the enterobacteriaceae decreased to undetectable levels within 24 h. the isolated microorganisms were tentatively identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus cellobiosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella confusa, issatchenkia orientalis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, candida pelliculosa and candida tropicalis. the ph decreased from 5.24-5.52 to 3.10-3.34. maltose increased initially and then decreased, fructose decreased and glucose levels increased during the first 12 h of fermentation. the organic acids detected during fermentation included dl-lactic, succinic, formic, pyruvic, citric, pyroglutamic and uric acid. lactate was the predominant acid and increased significantly with time. the volatile organic compounds (voc) detected  included acetaldehyde, 2-methyl-propanal, 2-methyl-butanal, 3-methyl-butanal, ethanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, diacetyl and acetoin. ethanol was the predominant voc and it increased significantly with  time.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria from fermented maize (kenkey)  and their interactions during fermentation.
AB  == a total of 241 lactic acid bacteria belonging to lactobacillus plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus fermentum/reuteri and lactobacillus brevis from various processing stages of maize dough fermentation were investigated. results indicated that each processing stage has its own microenvironment with strong antimicrobial activity. about half of the lact. plantarum and practically  all of the lact. fermentum/reuteri investigated were shown to inhibit other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, explaining the elimination of these organisms during the initial processing stages. further, widespread microbial interactions amounting to 85% to 18% of all combinations tested were demonstrated amongst lactic acid bacteria within the various processing stages, i.e. raw material, steeping, 0 h and 48 h of fermentation, explaining the microbial succession taking place amongst lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. the antimicrobial effect was explained by the combined effect of acids, compounds sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and other compounds with antimicrobial activity  with the acid production being the most important factor. the pattern of antimicrobial factors was not species-specific and the safety and storage stability of fermented maize seem to depend on a mixed population of lactic acid  bacteria with different types of antimicrobial characteristics. this means that introduction of pure cultures as starters may impose a risk to the product.

TI  == characterization and frequency distribution of species of lactic acid bacteria involved in the processing of mawe, a fermented maize dough from benin.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria involved in the natural fermentation of both home-produced and commercial mawe were investigated during a 72 h fermentation period. lactobacillus spp. constitute the majority (94%) of the strains of the lactic acid bacteria isolated, among which 89% represent the betabacterium group. they include l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) (41%), l. fermentum or l. reuteri (19%), l. brevis (26%), l. confusus (less than 2%), l. curvatus (less than 1%) and l. buchneri (less than 1%). other isolated lactic acid bacteria were l. salivarius, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici and leuconostoc mesenteroides. several species were detected at the early stage of fermentation, but the final stage was dominated by l. fermentum (biotype cellobiosus) and l. fermentum or l. reuteri totalling 90% of the isolated strains. the trend was the same for both home-produced and commercial mawe. no strains of l. plantarum, generally reported as dominating lactic acid bacteria at the final stage of fermentation of most plant foods, were isolated.
