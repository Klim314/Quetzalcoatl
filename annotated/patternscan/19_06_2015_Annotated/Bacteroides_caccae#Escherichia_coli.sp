TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of polyphenols on human gut microbiota.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota (im) is responsible for metabolism of many compounds provided in the diet, such as polyphenols, increasing their bioavailability. however, there are remarkably few studies investigating the influence of polyphenols on the composition and activity of the gut microbial community. this  study evaluated the influence of the polyphenols naringenin (n), naringin (nr), hesperetin (h), hesperidin (hr), quercetin (q), rutin (qr), and catechin (cat) on the growth of human im representatives (bacteroides galacturonicus, lactobacillus sp., enterococcus caccae, bifidobacterium catenulatum, ruminococcus gauvreauii, escherichia coli). polyphenols were added to liquid medium at a final concentration of 20, 100 or 250 mug/ml (for q concentrations were 4, 20 or 50 mug/ml) and their impact on the im was assessed by measurement of the turbidity after 24-h culture. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) for polyphenols that inhibited bacteria was estimated. cat had no impact on the tested im. q had  the strongest impact on r. gauvreauii, b. galacturonicus and lactobacillus sp. (mic 20-50 mug/ml) growth, whilst its rutinoside had no impact. nr and hr had no  impact, but their aglycones n and h inhibited growth of almost all analyzed bacteria (mic >/=250 mug/ml). we conclude that flavonoid aglycones, but not their glycosides, may inhibit growth of some intestinal bacteria. this means that polyphenols probably can modulate the im and indirectly interfere with their own  bioavailability.

TI  == mucosa-associated bacteria in two middle-aged women diagnosed with collagenous colitis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the colon microbiota in two women histologically diagnosed with collagenous colitis using a culture-independent method. methods: biopsies were taken from the ascending colon and the total dna was extracted. universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the bacterial 16s rrna genes. the amplicons were then cloned into competent escherichia coli cells. the clones were sequenced and identified by comparison to known sequences. results: the clones could be divided into 44 different phylotypes. the microbiota was dominated by firmicutes and bacteroidetes. seven phylotypes were found in both patients and constituted 47.5% of the total number of clones. of these, the most dominating were clones similar to bacteroides cellulosilyticus, bacteroides caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides dorei within  bacteroidetes. sequences similar to faecalibacterium prausnitzii and clostridium  citroniae were also found in both patients. conclusion: a predominance of potentially pathogenic bacteroides spp., and the presence of clones showing similarity to clostridium clostridioforme were found but the overall colon microbiota showed similarities to a healthy one. etiologies for collagenous colitis other than an adverse bacterial flora must also be considered.

TI  == human intestinal microbiota: characterization of a simplified and stable gnotobiotic rat model.
AB  == the study of host microbe interactions is hampered by the complexity and inter-individual variability of the human gut microbiota. therefore, a simplified human intestinal microbiota (sihumi) consisting of seven bacterial species was introduced into germfree rats. species selection was based on numerical importance and fermentative abilities in the human gut. association of the rats with the sihumi (anaerostipes caccae, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bifidobacterium longum, blautia producta, clostridium ramosum, escherichia coli and lactobacillus plantarum) resulted in increased faecal concentrations of short chain fatty acids compared to germfree animals. since the faecal butyrate concentration was low (0.9 +/- 0.5 micromol/g dry matter) the sihumi was complemented with clostridium butyricum. this extended bacterial community (sihumix) led to an increased faecal butyrate concentration of 1.5 +/- 0.7 micromol/g dry matter. besides forming scfa, the sihumix was capable of degrading mucins, beta-aspartylglycine and bilirubin. these features are characteristic of  conventional animals but not observed in germfree animals. dietary interventions  with modifications in fibre and fat content led to changes in the proportion of community members. the relative increase of one member of this community in response to a high-fat diet reflects the situation reported for obese mice and human subjects. the strength of the model communities is their remarkable stability over time and their easy transfer to the offspring.

TI  == advances in clinical laboratory tests for inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a generic term that refers to crohn's disease and chronic ulcerative colitis (uc). the cd and uc are considered to be distinct  forms of ibd; but there is a subgroup of cd with a uc-like presentation. the genetic factors play a significant role in ibd. ibd is associated with a strong familial pattern. recent studies support the hypothesis that ibd patients have a  dysregulated immune response to endogenous bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract. the serologic responses seen in crohn's disease include antibodies to saccharomyces cerevisiae, mycobacteria, bacteroides and e. coli. the panca antibody seen in uc and cd has been demonstrated to react with epitopes of h1 histone, bacteroides caccae (ton-b linked outer membrane protein), pseudomonas fluorescens-associated bacterial protein i-2, mycobacterial histone 1 homologue called hup b. in recent years, several serologic markers have been found to be useful for the diagnosis and differentiation of cd and uc. these markers include  the following antibodies: (a) panca, (b) asca, (c) anti-pancreatic antibody, (d)  ompc antibody and (e) i-2 antibody and antibodies to anaerobic coccoid rods. the  application of a panel of markers with the use of an algorithm (i.e. ibd first step) can identify specific subtypes of ibd that have different clinical courses  and progression of the diseases. the serologic markers are useful for the diagnosis and management of cd and uc patients.

TI  == colonic bacteria express an ulcerative colitis panca-related protein epitope.
AB  == bacteria are a suspected pathogenic factor in inflammatory bowel disease, but the identity of the relevant microbial species remains unresolved. the panca autoantibody is associated with most cases of ulcerative colitis (uc) and hence reflects an immune response associated with the disease process. this study addresses the hypothesis that panca identifies an antigen(s) expressed by bacteria resident in the human colonic mucosa. libraries of colonic bacteria were generated using aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic culture conditions, and bacterial pools and clonal isolates were evaluated for cross-reactive antigens by immunoblot analysis using the panca monoclonal antibody fab 5-3. two major species of proteins immunoreactive to panca monoclonal antibodies were detected in bacteria from the anaerobic libraries. colony isolates of the expressing bacteria were identified as bacteroides caccae and escherichia coli. isolation and partial sequencing of the b. caccae antigen identified a 100-kda protein without database homologous sequences. the e. coli protein was biochemically and  genetically identified as the outer membrane porin ompc. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with human sera demonstrated elevated immunoglobulin g anti-ompc in uc patients compared to healthy controls. these findings demonstrate that a panca monoclonal antibody detects a recurrent protein epitope expressed by colonic bacteria and implicates colonic bacterial proteins as a target of the disease-associated immune response.

TI  == a re-appraisal of the biological activity of bacteroides lps.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides (lps) were extracted from seven bacteroides strains by three  different techniques: the phenol-water (pw), phenol-chloroform-petroleum (pcp) and triton-mg2+ methods. the strains selected included two different b. fragilis  strains, one of which was grown in two different media. yields varied between the strains, growth media and extraction technique, but generally the highest yield by weight was from the pcp method and the lowest from the pw method. the pw method was selected for the greatest amounts of carbohydrate and kdo, and the pcp method for the least. phosphorus levels were more uniform among all extraction methods. protein contamination was found in all bacteroides lps extracts, with extremely low levels in pw-lps and the highest levels in material extracted by the pcp and triton-mg2+ techniques. no protein contamination could be detected after proteinase k treatment. after silver staining lps page profiles showed ladder patterns characteristics of smooth lps for b. vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and the control escherichia coli o18:k- strains, whereas the other bacteroides strains showed mainly rough and low m(r) material only. the pcp method did not select for high m(r) material in the b. fragilis strains; otherwise the lps profiles for all extraction methods were identical. the biological activities of native and sodium salt form lps were investigated on a weight for weight basis and compared to that of e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. amongst the lps from bacteroides strains, those prepared by the pw method were found to have a significantly higher activity in a galactosamine mouse lethality model, in induction of tnf and the limulus amoebocyte lysate (lal) assay, than lps extracted by the pcp or triton-mg2+ methods. lps from bacteroides strains extracted by the pcp method had consistently low activity in all assays. comparing pw-lps from bacteroides strains with that from e. coli o18:k- in the galactosamine mouse model, the e. coli o18:k- lps was c. 5000-fold more active than the most active bacteroides lps. however, in the lal assay native pw-lps from both the b. fragilis strains, and b. caccae had higher activities (up to 30-fold) than e. coli o18:k- lps, with the pw-lps from the other bacteroides spp. being up to 15-fold less active than the e. coli o18:k- pw-lps. in the tnf induction assay, e. coli o18:k- pw-lps was 4-50-fold more active than bacteroides pw-lps.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == isolation and identification of intestinal bacteria from japanese tree frog (hlya japonica) with the special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the bacteria in the large intestines of eight japanese tree frogs (hlya japonica) were enumerated by using an anaerobic culture system. the microorganisms at approximately 3.1 x 10(9) bacteria per g (wet weight) of intestinal contents were present in the intestine of all the frogs tested. no difference of the total bacteria in the frog intestine was observed between two different incubation-temperatures (room temperature and 37 degrees c). eleven genera and 16 species were isolated from the frog intestine. in most frogs, bacteroides (b.) caccae and b. vulgatus were detected as the predominant organisms. escherichia coli was also present in greater numbers in the intestine. other bacteria isolated at high dilutions were strict anaerobes, including fusobacterium and clostridium. enterococcus faecalis was frequently isolated from the frog intestine. however, four genera of bifidobacterium, eubacterium, peptostreptococcus, and lactobacillus were not isolated from the frog intestine.
