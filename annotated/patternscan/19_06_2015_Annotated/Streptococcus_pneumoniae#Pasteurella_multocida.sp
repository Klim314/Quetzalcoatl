TI  == ocular penetration of topical antibiotics: study on the penetration of chloramphenicol, tobramycin and netilmicin into the anterior chamber after topical administration.
AB  == background: to compare penetration in the aqueous humour of topically applied antibiotics. design: randomized prospective study, department of ophthalmology, university of perugia, italy participants: patients undergoing cataract surgery.  methods: one hundred twenty-two patients were included: 14 received one drop of chloramphenicol suspension; 12 one application of chloramphenicol gel; 11 one drop of netilmicin suspension; 13 one drop of tobramycin suspension; 37 repeated  instillations of chloramphenicol suspension every 10 min for a total of four drops; and 35 repeated instillations of chloramphenicol gel every 10 min for a total of four drops. samples were taken immediately before surgery from the anterior chamber in order to determine the antibiotic by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. samples were taken 45-190 min after the eye drops were instilled. main outcome measures: intraocular penetration of chloramphenicol, netilmicin and tobramicyn. results: after a single administration, netilmicin and tobramycin were undetectable, whereas the chloramphenicol suspension reached a mean concentration of 0.23 +/- 0.21 mug/ml,  and the chloramphenicol gel a mean concentration of 0.13 +/- 0.14 mug/ml. after repeated administrations, the mean concentrations of the chloramphenicol suspension and gel were 0.60 +/- 0.26 mug/ml and 0.58 +/- 0.18 mug/ml, respectively. conclusions: tobramycin and netilmicin do not reach detectable concentrations, whereas chloramphenicol, after multiple administrations, reaches  concentrations that are effective against haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus  parainfluenzae, legionella pneumophila, moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus pneumoniae. this means that chloramphenicol can be rationally used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections supported by sensitive germs.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == [overwhelming postsplenectomy infection 22 years after splenectomy].
AB  == a 25-year-old man undergoing splenectomy at 3 years of age to treat idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura but no history of streptococcus pneumonia vaccination, and reporting high fever, nausea, and headache developed purpura, confusion, and  hypotension the next day and was admitted. detailed examination showed disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple-organ dysfunction. chest x-ray and computed tomography (ct) showed pneumonia and pleural effusion. blood culture was positive for s. pneumoniae. gram staining of sputa yielded numerous white blood cells and gram-negative rods, and sputa culture was positive for pasteurella multocida and haemophilus influenzae. the medical history and presence of these organisms yielded a diagnosis of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (opsi), and the patient responded to treatment with a combination of benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, and meropenem. this case suggests that patients with a history of splenectomy may benefit from vaccination for s. pneumoniae and  adequate education on opsi.

TI  == etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of poland.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of poland in years 2003-2005. bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from california mastitis test (cmt) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of api tests (analytical profile index). it was found that 32.7% of samples that were cmt positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (cns) (14.6%), staph. aureus (8.6%), gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among gram-negative bacilli followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), serratia marcescens (3.1%), pasteurella multocida (3.1%), acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria  species. stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), staph. hyicus (12.2%), staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), staph. sciuri (11.6%), staph. chromogenes (8.8%), staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent cns. streptococcus uberis (50%), str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), str. acidominimus (6.6%) and enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among camp-negative streptococci. an increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, staph. aureus, a. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.

TI  == pcr evaluation of false-positive signals from two automated blood-culture systems.
AB  == rapid detection of micro-organisms from blood is one of the most critical functions of a diagnostic microbiology laboratory. automated blood-culture systems reduce the time needed to detect positive cultures, and reduce specimen handling. the false-positive rate of such systems is 1-10%. in this study, the presence of pathogens in 'false-positive' bottles obtained from bactec 9050 (becton dickinson) and bact/alert (biomerieux) systems was investigated by eubacterial and fungal pcr. a total of 169 subculture-negative aerobic blood-culture bottles (104 bact/alert and 65 bactec) were evaluated. both fungal  and eubacterial pcrs were negative for all bactec bottles. fungal pcr was also negative for the bact/alert system, but 10 bottles (9.6%) gave positive results by eubacterial pcr. sequence analysis of the positive pcr amplicons indicated the presence of the following bacteria (number of isolates in parentheses): pasteurella multocida (1), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), staphylococcus hominis (1), micrococcus sp. (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), corynebacterium spp. (2), brachibacterium sp. (1) and arthrobacter/rothia sp. (1). antibiotic usage by the  patients may be responsible for the inability of the laboratory to grow these bacteria on subcultures. for patients with more than one false-positive bottle, molecular methods can be used to evaluate the microbial dna in these bottles. false positives from the bactec system may be due to elevated patient leukocyte counts or the high sensitivity of the system to background increases in co(2) concentration.

TI  == experimental pneumococcal pleural empyema model: the effect of moxifloxacin.
AB  == objectives: pleural empyema is a serious complication of pneumonia, the optimal therapy of which is still unknown. the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of moxifloxacin in this condition. methods: pleural empyema was induced in rabbits by intrapleural administration of pasteurella multocida (10(5-6) cfu)  or turpentine (0.3 ml) followed 3 h later by instillation of streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc 49619) (10(6) cfu) into the pleural cavity. the mics of moxifloxacin for s. pneumoniae and p. multocida were 0.4 and 0.05 mg/l, respectively. starting 30 h following s. pneumoniae challenge intramuscular moxifloxacin 12.5 and 25 mg/kg was administered x 4 (every 12 h). pleural empyema fluid samples were obtained for bacterial count at 12 h intervals following the first three moxifloxacin administrations. moxifloxacin levels in pleural empyema  and serum samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 480 min and 12 h  after the 4th dose and determined by bioassay. results: in control animals, s. pneumoniae (and p. multocida) persisted in the pleural empyema. s. pneumoniae also persisted in the pleural empyema fluid when moxifloxacin was administered at 12.5 mg/kg (x4 administrations). mean serum and pleural empyema peak moxifloxacin levels (following the 25 mg/kg dose) were 7.6 (+/-3.2) and 4.8 (+/-2.5) mg/l, respectively. pleural empyema peak moxifloxacin concentration lagged 1 h after serum moxifloxacin. serum and pleural empyema half-lives were approximately 1.5 and approximately 6 h, respectively. serum auc(1-12) was 29.4 (+/-6.8) mg.h/l and serum area under the inhibitory concentration curve (auic) was 73.5 mg.h/l. pleural empyema auc(1-12) was 34.3 (+/-11.7) mg/l and pleural empyema auic was 85.8 mg.h/l. s. pneumoniae was eradicated from pleural empyema following a single dose of moxifloxacin 25 mg/kg in 52% of the animals and in 96% following four doses. moxifloxacin was also effective in eradication of p. multocida. the rate of pleural empyema sterilization was related to moxifloxacin serum auic (r = 0.82) as well as serum peak moxifloxacin level (r = 0.84), but not to pleural empyema auic (r = 0.19) or pleural empyema peak levels. the results were similar  for both methods of induction of pleural empyema. conclusions: moxifloxacin appears to penetrate well into experimental pleural empyema and effectively sterilize it from s. pneumoniae. sterilization of s. pneumoniae is related to serum auic rather than to moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics in pleural empyema.

TI  == construction and evaluation of a plasmid vector for the expression of recombinant lipoproteins in escherichia coli.
AB  == outer membrane lipoproteins are emerging as key targets for protective immunity to many bacterial pathogens. heterologous expression of lipoproteins in escherichia coli does not always result in high level expression of acylated recombinant protein. thus, these proteins do not take up their correct membrane topology and are lacking the immunostimulatory properties endowed by the lipid. to this end, we have designed a lipoprotein expression vector (pdump) that results in the production of fusion proteins containing the e. coli major outer membrane lipoprotein (lpp) signal sequence, lipoprotein signal peptidase recognition site, and the +2 outer membrane sorting signal at their n termini. to test the ability of pdump to express lipoproteins from heterologous hosts, the surface lipoprotein psaa from the gram-positive organism streptococcus pneumoniae and the outer membrane lipoproteins mlpa from the gram-negative pasteurella multocida and blpa from the spirochete brachyspira hyodysenteriae were cloned into both hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump. high level expression of antigenically active protein from both the hexahistidine fusion vectors and pdump resulted in abundant bands of the predicted molecular masses when analyzed by sds-page. when grown in the presence of 3[h]palmitic acid, proteins encoded by pdump were observed to incorporate palmitic acid whilst the hexahistidine fusion  proteins did not. using mass spectrometry and image analysis we determined the efficiency of lipidation between the three clones to vary from 31.7 to 100%. in addition, lipidated, but not hexahistidine, forms of the proteins were presented  on the e. coli surface.

TI  == recent progress in novel macrolides, quinolones, and 2-pyridones to overcome bacterial resistance.
AB  == macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, having good activity against pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia, campylobacter spp, branhamella spp, pasteurella multocida and streptococci, have gained wide acceptance for the treatment of both upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as cutaneous infections. emergence of bacterial resistance, particularly in gram-positive bacteria, has been observed. macrolide-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and s.  pyogenes are found in france and many other countries, resulting in failure of therapy for pneumonia, pharyngitis, and skin infection. ru 004, hmr 3647, and te  802 were reported to be active against these resistant strains. research at abbott produced several macrolide derivatives in the anhydrolide, tricyclic and tetracyclic ketolides as well as 6-o-alkyl ketolides series having potent activity against macrolide resistant s. pyogenes and s. pneumoniae. research on streptogramins to overcome bacterial resistance in gram-positive bacteria has produced interesting compounds. another class of antibacterial agent called quinolones is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections of respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissues, as well as sexually transmitted diseases. ciprofloxacin, the market leader, however, has low potency against anaerobes. bacterial resistance ( such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin- resistant staphylococcus aureus ) to ciprofloxacin is increasing rapidly. many quinolone compounds are being synthesized to address these drawbacks. the new quinolones currently under development are characterized by enhanced activities against streptococci, staphylococci, enterococci, and anaerobes. this presentation reviews the current research in the identification of agents to overcome the macrolide and quinolone resistance.

TI  == clinical and microbiological study of an otitis media outbreak in calves in a dairy herd.
AB  == on a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. the inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. the affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. of the  affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (october-december). pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), p. multocida from 20 (31.2%), actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. the exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal  ear flora. on the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. after a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases.  possible preventive measures are discussed.

TI  == [role of macrolides in the treatment of respiratory tract infections in children].
AB  == macrolides are antibiotics with high intracellular concentrations. they have a bacteriostatic activity but are also bactericides for concentrations five times greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration, concentrations in which they reach in the respiratory tract. they are usually active on streptococcus, neisseria, moraxella catarrhalis, listeria monocytogenes, bordetella pertussis, pasteurella multocida, chlamydia, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila and helicobacter pylori. they have few secondary effects, some in relation with drug interactions. their main indications are bronchopulmonary infections due to  mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, chlamydia trachomatis and legionella pneumophila. they are also useful in whooping cough allowing the eradication of bordetella pertussis in the rhinopharynx, thus limiting the dissemination of the  infection in children. in amygdalitis and pharyngitis, macrolides are a good substitute in the case of allergy to penicillin. new generation of macrolides (roxithromycine, clarithromycine, dirithromycine, azithromycine) might open other interesting therapeutic perspectives.

TI  == the development of macrolides: clarithromycin in perspective.
AB  == macrolide antibiotics have been available and used clinically since 1952. the class of drugs originated from a soil sample obtained from the city of ilo-ilo on the island of paray in the philippines. erythromycin has been the most widely used agent of this class called 'macrolides' because they possess the macrocyclic lactone nucleus. many esters of erythromycin are well established as agents to treat a variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections, particularly in children. there has been a resurgence of interest in macrolides as a result of the recognition of pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia and campylobacter spp. a number of new 14-membered macrolides have been synthesised in recent years with the goal of overcoming some of the problems of the older erythromycin agents. there has been variable activity of erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae;  there has been gastrointestinal irritation, particularly in adults; and the older agents are administered four times a day. clarithromycin has increased activity against legionella, and branhamella spp., and pasteurella multocida, and, with its 14-oh metabolite, inhibits haemophilus spp. it is also more active against chlamydia and against anaerobic species while retaining excellent activity against streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae. it has increased plasma  peak levels and a sufficiently long half-life for twice daily administration. furthermore, it is well tolerated. thus clarithromycin offers potential for use in those areas in which a safe, well tolerated macrolide will be used, namely respiratory, skin structure and selected diarrhoeal and genital infections.

TI  == [possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  == in the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. as shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (klebsiella ozanae, k. pneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus pneumoniae), mycoplasma pneumoniae and m. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (bacillus cereus, brucella abortus, erysipelothrix insidiosa, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, s. typhi). consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the c-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. in modified boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much  less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated  ones (fig. 1).
