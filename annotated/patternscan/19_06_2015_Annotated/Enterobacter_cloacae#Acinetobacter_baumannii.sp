TI  == influence of 4'-o-glycoside constitution and configuration on ribosomal selectivity of paromomycin.
AB  == a series of 20 4'-o-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic  ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. in particular, 4'-o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the a1555g mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).  the paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of mrsa that  are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-o-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant e. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.

TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: results from the surveillance of multicenter antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart).
AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == epidemiological characteristics of blandm-1 in enterobacteriaceae and the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex in china from 2011 to 2012.
AB  == objectives: the study aimed to investigate the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of blandm-1 (encoding new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) in enterobacteriaceae and the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex (abc) in china from july 2011 to june 2012. methods: pcr was used to screen for the presence of blandm-1 in all organisms studied. for blandm-1-positive strains, 16s rrna analysis and analytical profile index (api) strips were used to identify the bacterial genus and species. the abcs were reconfirmed by pcr detection of blaoxa-51-like. antibiotic susceptibilities of the bacteria were assessed by determining minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)  of them using two-fold agar dilution test, as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). molecular typing was performed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). s1 nuclease-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (s1-pfge) and southern blot hybridization were conducted to ascertain the gene location of blandm-1. conjugation experiments were conducted to determine the transmission of blandm-1-positive strains. results: among 2,170  enterobacteriaceae and 600 abcs, seven enterobacteriaceae strains and two a. calcoaceticus isolates from five different cities carried the blandm-1 gene. the  seven enterobacteriaceae strains comprised four klebsiella pneumoniae, one enterobacter cloacae, one enterobacter aerogen and one citrobacter freundii. all  seven were non-susceptible to imipenem, meropenem or ertapenem. two a. calcoaceticus species were resistant to imipenem and meropenem. three k. pneumoniae showed the same pfge profiles. the blandm-1 genes of eight strains were localized on plasmids, while one was chromosomal. conclusions: compared with previous reports, the numbers and species containing the blandm-1 in enterobacteriaceae have significantly increased in china. most of them are able to disseminate the gene, which is cause for concern. consecutive surveillance should be implemented and should also focus on the dissemination of blandm-1 among gram-negative clinical isolates.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an iraqi burn care unit.
AB  == objective: in low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. we describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in iraq. methods: we performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between july 2008 and september 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in iraq who developed sepsis. results: in 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% ci 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. the most commonly isolated organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). a high proportion of enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and s. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. for gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. conclusions: burn patients with sepsis in iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class  antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.

TI  == french regional surveillance program of carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli: results from a 2-year period.
AB  == in february 2011, the carb-lr group was created as a sentinel laboratory-based surveillance network to control the emergence of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (cr gnb) in a french southern region. we report the epidemiological results of a 2-year study. all the gram-negative bacilli isolates detected in the different labs (hospital and community settings) of a french southern region and with reduced susceptibility to ertapenem and/or imipenem were characterised with regard to antibiotic resistance, bla genes content, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr) profiles and multilocus sequence typing (mlst). a total of 221 strains were analysed. acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent carbapenemase-producing bacteria, with a majority of oxa-23 producers (n = 37). one isolate co-produced oxa-23 and oxa-58  enzymes. klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (cpe) (oxa-48 producer: n = 29, kpc producer: n = 1), followed by escherichia coli (oxa-48 producer: n = 8, kpc producer: n = 1) and enterobacter cloacae (oxa-48 producer, n = 1). one isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa produced a vim-1 carbapenemase. a clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing k. pneumoniae and e. coli was noted with different mlsts. on the other hand, almost all oxa-23-producing a. baumannii strains belonged to the widespread st2/international clone ii. the link between the detection of cr gnb and a foreign country was less obvious, suggesting the beginning of a local cross-transmission. the number of cr gnb cases in our french southern region has  sharply increased very recently due to the diffusion of oxa-48 producers.

TI  == tolerability and efficacy of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin in a patient with a polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint  reinfection: a case report.
AB  == introduction: prosthetic joint infections are severe complications of joint implants. further complications arise when polymicrobial and/or multidrug-resistant microorganisms are involved. currently, there are limited data on the management of these infections and on the tolerability of long-term treatment with daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin. case presentation: a 55-year-old caucasian woman who had a right hip prosthesis removed 1 year prior because of infection was admitted for prosthesis reimplantation. on admission at  our hospital, anamnesis regarding etiology and management of prosthesis infection was not available. on clinical, laboratory findings and imaging studies infection was not suspected. a hip prosthesis was reimplanted. at surgery, histopathological and microbiological investigations were not taken. three weeks  after reimplantation, surgical site infection due to enterobacter cloacae was diagnosed and oral ciprofloxacin was prescribed. four days later, a periprosthesis fluid collection was evidenced and a percutaneous needle aspirate  grew staphylococcus epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. enterobacter genome was also detected from the same sample. teicoplanin and meropenem were added to ciprofloxacin without clinical improvement. moreover, acetabular cup dislocation  was documented. she underwent prosthesis explantation, debridement, and positioning of an antimicrobial mixed spacer. from the intraoperatory cultures s. epidermidis and acinetobacter baumannii were grown. daptomycin, ceftazidime, colistin and rifampin were administered. four days later, rifampin was stopped due to a suspected liver toxicity. while undergoing therapy she presented recurrent episodes of wound dehiscence and on the 22nd week of treatment a further surgical debridement was performed, upon which the spacer was removed. at this time, intraoperative cultures resulted negative. three months later, after a total of 8 months, antimicrobials were interrupted. subsequently, a femoral transcondylar traction was positioned, and 3 weeks later a new prosthesis was reimplanted. at over 1 year after reimplantation she is well. conclusions: our findings suggest that microbiologic investigations are mandatory even when prosthetic joint infection is not suspected. molecular methods for identification of microorganisms can be used in addition to conventional cultures especially when patients are under antibiotic treatment. daptomycin, ceftazidime and colistin can be administered for several months without side effects. guidelines  specifically addressing the diagnosis and the management of polymicrobial, multidrug-resistant prosthetic joint infections need to be developed.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == eliciting antibiotics active against the eskape pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  == the rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. in recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the himalaya and qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against mdr pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes  were identified - predominantly streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the mdr clinical isolates referred to as eskape pathogens: enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or enterobacter cloacae. antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not  described previously. our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that  have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific  pathogen.

TI  == travel-related carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria in alberta, canada: the first 3 years.
AB  == we describe here the characteristics of alberta, canada, patients with infections or colonizations with carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria during 2010  to 2013 that were linked to recent travel outside canada. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution, and isolates were characterized using pcr, sequencing, and multilocus sequencing typing. a broth mating study was used to assess the transferability of resistance plasmids, which were subsequently characterized. all the patients (n=12) included in our study had contact with a health care system while abroad. most of the patients presented with urinary tract infections (utis) and were admitted to hospitals within weeks after their return to alberta. secondary spread occurred in 1 case,  resulting in the death of another patient. the carbapenemase-producing bacteria (n=17) consisted of escherichia coli (sequence type 101 [st101], st365, st405, and st410) with ndm-1, klebsiella pneumoniae (st15, st16, st147, st258, st340, st512, and st972) with ndm-1, oxa-181, kpc-2, and kpc-3, acinetobacter baumannii  with oxa-23, providencia rettgeri with ndm-1, enterobacter cloacae with kpc-2, and citrobacter freundii with ndm-1. the blandm-1 gene was associated with various narrow- (i.e., incf) and broad- (i.e., inca/c and incl/m) host-range plasmids with different addiction factors. our results show that ndm-producing k. pneumoniae, belonging to a variety of sequence types with different plasmid scaffolds, are regularly imported from india into alberta. clinical microbiology  laboratories should remain vigilant in detecting bacteria with carbapenemases.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. clinical non-duplicate isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their mics of tigecycline alone and in combination with ppis (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. with one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of ppis on tigecycline activity. the mic changes after ppis addition correlated with the  ppis concentrations in the test media. compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. the time-kill study confirmed that the addition of ppis could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. even at low concentration (5 mg/l) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in e. cloacae  and e. faecalis strains. we conclude that in vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of ppis in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == an analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1b with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

AB  == bacteria producing new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) exhibit high level  resistance to beta-lactams including carbapenems. this broad-spectrum resistance  limits treatment options for infections caused by ndm-1 producers. ndm-1 was first isolated from an indian patient in sweden; since then, ndm-1 producing isolates have been identified in many countries including turkey. in this study,  we investigated the presence of ndm-1 by pcr method in various gram-negative isolates recovered from clinical specimens in tertiary care hospitals in samsun,  turkey. a total of 210 carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates (132 acinetobacter baumannii, 54 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 pseudomonas putida, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 3 enterobacter aerogenes, 3 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia rettgeri, 2 escherichia coli and 1 citrobacter freundii) were included in the study. identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates were performed by using vitek-2 compact (biomerieux, france) and bd  phoenix (bd diagnostic systems, md) automated systems. the results of antibiotic  susceptibility testing were interpreted according to the clsi recommendations. in our study, ndm-1 gene was not detected in any of the clinical isolates by pcr. there was only one case study that reported the presence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates from turkey [poirel l et al. antimicrob agents chemother 2012;56:2784].  our data, together with the others, indicated that the existence of ndm-1 in clinical isolates is not common in turkey. however, since ndm-1 is a plasmid-encoded enzyme, there is always a risk of spread of this resistance through the bacterial strains in our country. therefore, continuous surveillance  and investigation of carbapenem-resistant isolates with resistance patterns suggestive of ndm-1 may enable to identify ndm-1 producing isolates. meanwhile special care should be given on rational antibiotic use and establishment of appropriate infection control policies to prevent the spread of ndm-1 producers and other potential resistant strains.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal icu of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, india.
AB  == background: an early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. for the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. aim: to study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. setting and design: this was a retrospective study which was  conducted in the department of microbiology and the neonatal intensive care unit  (nicu) at sgrdimsar, amritsar, during june 2011 to june 2012. methods and materials: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. results: a total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. these included staphylococcus aureus (n=68), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (n=30), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), escherichia coli (n=05), enterobacter cloacae (n=04), citrobacter diversus (n=02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and candida (n=01). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis.  on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. the resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. the resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. a majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. conclusion: the present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == rapid identification of eskape bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  == this article describes bacteria id chips ('bacchips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. bacchips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (pdms). each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. pressing the layer of pdms into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). after assembly, bacchips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. to use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased pdms draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. after the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air  is drawn into the bacchip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. a ph indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. importantly, bacchips operate  without external equipment or instruments. by visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that bacchips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the eskape panel of pathogens, including strains of: enterococcus faecalis, enteroccocus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterobacter cloacae. this article describes a bacchip for point-of-care detection of eskape pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

AB  == this study examined the pattern of colonization of the neonatal gut by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and evaluated the association between gut colonization and sepsis in the developing world. this deserves attention because  of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. the study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for gnb. blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. antibiograms, serotyping and pfge were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. a diverse array of gnb was isolated from the gut of the neonates, klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by escherichia coli. the rate of isolation of gnb was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by  the prolonged use of a feeding tube. gnb were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with k. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated gnb from the blood. acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and burkholderia cepacia were the other gnb recovered from the blood of the neonates. neonates with gnb in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. in 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. these results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of gnb, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.

TI  == mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == the inhibitory effect of zingiber corallinum hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  == background: the excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of zingiber corallinum hance essential oil (zcho) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. material/methods: susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of zcho on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. mice orally administered with zcho were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (ld(5)(0)) of zcho. broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of zcho on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. results: zcho exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. the zcho containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than zcho with 34% terpinen-4-ol. the ld(5)(0) of zcho was 1790.427 mg/kg. the mic and mbc of zcho on drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/l. conclusions: zcho has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. therefore, zcho is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its  low toxicity.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  == wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. it is therefore imperative that  antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at west virginia university hospital. standardised corrected zones of inhibition (czois) were performed on all clinical isolates. it was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. in particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of candida albicans and yeasts with czoi of 3-11.5 mm. all meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) strains were  found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a czoi range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for s. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. czois of 4.25 mm were calculated for enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. the bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii. contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and candida albicans. no antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by kirby bauer clinical laboratory standards institute classification  system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. when a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. this finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.

TI  == changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == [infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens].
AB  == background: intensive therapy units are the places where pathogens can easily spread. improper antibiotic therapy contributes to the selection of new strains called multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant or pandrug-resistant. for  itu patients, such pathogens are particularly dangerous. case report: the case of a 50-year-old man diagnosed with septic shock after repeated surgeries due to vater's ampulla tumour was described. in blood and peritoneal fluid cultures, enterobacter cloacae esbl and klebsiella pneumoniae were first isolated; then acinetobacter baumannii was also detected. the targeted antibiotic therapy instituted did not bring the expected results. on day 5, tigecycline and imipenem were started and continued over 10 days. after 4 days of combined therapy, bacterial strains were eradicated. the patient was sent to the referring ward in  good condition. conclusion: combined use of imipenem and a new antibiotic - tigecycline provides effective treatment of septic shock in the course of intra-abdominal infection.

TI  == the prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ett) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of vap, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated etts with that of silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. the etts were tested for their ability  to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and candida albicans. scanning electron microscopy studies  revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ett but not on the gardine-coated ett. the gardine and gendine etts completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver etts (p < 0.001). the gardine- and gendine-coated etts were more durable against mrsa than either the silver-coated  or uncoated etts for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). we have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated etts are superior to silver-coated etts in preventing biofilm. future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated etts can significantly reduce the risk of vap.

TI  == bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  == the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa). degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (c-terminal to arg-15 and n-terminal to arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, n-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, d-arginine (d-arg) or ornithine (orn), were tested. these modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. for oncocin with two orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. an increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two d-arg residues  at these same positions. the antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against e. coli and were not toxic to hela cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.

TI  == comparing in vitro activity of tigecycline by using the disk diffusion test, the  manual microdilution method, and the vitek 2 automated system.
AB  == tigecycline is a broad spectrum antibiotic having activity against multiresistant isolates. in vitro susceptibility testing is difficult to perform with the use of traditional microbiological techniques. the aim of this study was to evaluate the disk diffusion test with three different mueller-hinton agar brands, and the vitek 2 automated system in comparison with the standard broth microdilution method against 200 gram-negative isolates (escherichia coil, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens and acinetobacter baumannii). among enterobacteriaceae, the becton dickinson agar had the lowest rate of minor (32.5%) and major errors (3.8%). no very major errors were found. for a. baumanni, the rate of minor and major errors was lower. a high rate of agreement (94%) was found between the broth microdilution method and the vitek 2  system. our results show that there are important differences between agars used  for the disk diffusion test, and that vitek 2 is a valid tool for susceptibility  testing in clinical laboratories.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == a novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
AB  == polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. nab741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). at the n terminus of the peptide, nab741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. nab741 sensitized escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae,  and acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. when tested by using etest strips  on plates containing increasing concentrations of nab741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (fici) of the combination of nab741 with rifampin  ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. when tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding fici values against e. coli atcc 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. in addition, at 4 microg/ml, nab741 decreased the mics of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for e. coli strains and e.  cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. a sister peptide, nab752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. furthermore, nab741 sensitized e. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. the renal clearance of nab741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, nab7061, and nab739, respectively.

TI  == colistin administration to pediatric and neonatal patients.
AB  == emergence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens has led to resurgence of colistin use. safety and efficacy data regarding colistin use in pediatric patients are sparse, while optimal dosage has not been defined. we present a case series of neonates and children without cystic fibrosis treated with various doses of colistin intravenously. the records of patients who received colistin in a tertiary-care hospital from january 2007 to march 2009 were reviewed. thirteen patients (median age 5 years, range 22 days to 14 years)  received 19 courses of colistin as treatment of pneumonia, central nervous system infection, bacteremia, or complicated soft tissue infection. the isolated pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. daily dose  of colistin (colistimethate) ranged between 40,000 and 225,000 iu/kg. duration of administration ranged from 1 to 133 days. other antimicrobials were co-administered in 18/19 courses. increase of serum creatinine in one patient was associated with co-administration of colistin and gentamicin. sixteen of 19 courses had a favorable outcome, and only two of the three deaths were infection-related. colistin intravenous administration appears well tolerated even at higher than previously recommended doses and of prolonged duration.

TI  == [investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  == sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. the aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. a total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. the antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in mueller-hinton broth according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guideline. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant s. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for  10 vancomycin-susceptible enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant e. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 enterobacter aerogenes strains. the mic values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for s. aureus atcc 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for e. faecalis atcc 29212, 32 microg/ml for k. pneumoniae atcc 700603, 32 microg/ml for e. coli atcc 25922 and  > 128 microg/ml for p. aeruginosa atcc 27853. sertralin has showed antibacterial  activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that mic values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == colistin therapy for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections: a retrospective cohort study of 258 patients.
AB  == it is unclear whether the effectiveness of polymyxins depends on the site of infection, the responsible pathogen, dosage, and monotherapy vs. combination therapy. we investigated colistin therapy in a large, retrospective, single-centre, cohort study. primary analysis outcomes were infection outcome, survival and nephrotoxicity. over a 7-year period (october 2000 to october 2007), 258 patients received intravenous (i.v.) colistin for at least 72h for microbiologically documented multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections, comprising 170 (65.9%) acinetobacter baumannii, 68 (26.4%) pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 (7.0%) klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 (0.4%) stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 1 (0.4%) enterobacter cloacae. cure of infection occurred in 79.1% of patients, nephrotoxicity in 10% and hospital survival in 65.1%. in the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of survival were colistin average daily dose [adjusted odds ratio (aor)=1.22, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.05-1.42] and cure of infection (aor=9, 95% ci 3.6-23.1), whilst the proportion of creatinine change (aor=0.21, 95% ci 0.1-0.45), acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (apache) ii score (aor=0.89, 95% ci 0.84-0.95) and  haematological disease (aor=0.23, 95% ci 0.08-0.66) were associated with mortality. effectiveness of colistin was not dependent on the type of pathogen. no independent predictors for nephrotoxicity were observed. the findings of the largest cohort study to date on i.v. colistin show that colistin is a valuable antibiotic with acceptable nephrotoxicity and considerable effectiveness that depends on the daily dosage and infection site.

TI  == novel insights about class 2 integrons from experimental and genomic epidemiology.
AB  == in order to contribute to the knowledge of the architecture and epidemiology of class 2 integrons, we performed a class 2 integron molecular survey in which we analyzed 726 isolates in two bacterial populations from environmental and nonepidemiologically related clinical samples, respectively, collected from 1982  to 2007. we recovered the inti2 gene from 130 of 726 isolates, most of which were clinical isolates, and only 1 (a psychrophilic pseudomonas sp.) was from a water  sample. unlike the widespread distribution of class 1 integrons within gram-negative bacilli, only acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae harbored class 2 integrons at a high frequency in our collection. class 2 integrons with six novel cassette arrays were documented. characterization of the transposition module of tn7, the genetic platform in which class 2 integrons have always been reported, showed tns modules with a mosaic genetic structure. a bioinformatic analysis performed with the tns genes present in sequence databases, the finding of inti2 not associated with tns genes, and the genetic examination of novel tns-like genes found in three isolates indicated the possibility of the independent evolution of the two components related to horizontal gene transfer, the class 2 integrons and the tn7 transposons.

TI  == detecting related cases of bloodstream infections using time-interval distribution modelling.
AB  == an algorithm was designed to highlight related bloodstream infections using data  from a nosocomial infection surveillance system to help local public health authorities direct specific measures towards clusters of cases. the approach was  based on a two-step procedure. the first was a test to identify pathogens with an abnormal number of close cases. the second modelled, for the identified pathogens, the distribution of time intervals between successive cases as a mixture of two theoretical distributions in order to determine a threshold below  which a specific investigation is required. the algorithm was applied to bloodstream infection surveillance data collected during a 10-year period (1996-2005) in an 878-bed teaching hospital (24 wards) in lyon, france. the first step identified seven pathogens among the 18 being studied. the modelling succeeded in setting time thresholds to spot clusters of cases requiring further  investigation with defined sensitivity and specificity. setting the sensitivity level at 95%, the threshold values ranged from 24 days (acinetobacter baumannii)  to 294 days (enterobacter cloacae); the specificity was higher than 70% (up to 97.5% for a. baumannii) except for e. cloacae (52.1%). setting the specificity level at 95% resulted in a decrease in sensitivity except for a. baumannii (it reached nearly 100%); it fell below 50% for three pathogens: around 40% for streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis and 25% for enterobacter cloacae. the threshold values then ranged from 8 days (s. pneumoniae) to 67 days  (streptococcus pyogenes). the approach proved promising though further refinements are needed before routine use.

TI  == in vitro activities of antimicrobials against six important species of gram-negative bacteria isolated from raw milk samples in korea.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria (gnb) with multidrug resistance pose a serious threat to public health. they are environmental pathogens frequently isolated from raw milk and mastitis in dairy cattle. this study was to examine the in vitro antimicrobial activities against 225 isolates belonging to six important species  of gnb from mastitic raw milk samples of dairy herds in the republic of korea: acinetobacter baumannii (n = 17), citrobacter freundii (n = 19), enterobacter cloacae (n = 54), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 55), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 45), and serratia marcescens (n = 35). in general, amikacin, gentamicin, and piperacillin exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against all bacterial species tested, whereas rifampin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and ampicillin were ineffective against most of the bacterial species tested. wide differences were observed in the patterns of resistance among the bacterial species; in particular, resistance to kanamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol was highly variable among the strains belonging to different bacterial species. almost half of the gnb isolates (45.3%, 102/225) were resistant to 5 or more of 12 antimicrobial agents tested: p. aeruginosa (86.6%, 39/45) showed the highest resistance rate, followed by s. marcescens (65.7%, 23/35). this study indicates that multiple antimicrobial resistances are prevalent among gnb isolates from mastitic milk samples of dairy cattle in the republic of korea.

AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

TI  == summer peaks in the incidences of gram-negative bacterial infection among hospitalized patients.
AB  == objective: recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. there are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. we quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. methods: a cohort of all adult patients admitted to the university of maryland medical center during the period  from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. results: there were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by p. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; p ! .01), e. cloacae (46%; p  ! .01), e. coli (12%; p ! .01), and a. baumannii (21%; pp.06). for each 10 degrees f increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection  caused by p. aeruginosa (pp.01) and a. baumanii (pp.05). conclusion: significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. for some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. these findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.

TI  == nosocomial spread of arma-mediated high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterobacteriaceae isolates producing ctx-m-3 beta-lactamase in a cancer hospital in bulgaria.
AB  == 1,310 enterobacteriaceae, 242 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 97 acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates collected at a cancer hospital in bulgaria were screened for the presence of 16s rrna methylases. the arma methylase gene was identified in 20 (1.5%) enterobacteriaceae (7 klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 escherichia coli, 3 serratia marcescens, 3 citrobacter freundii , 3 enterobacter  cloacae and 1 klebsiella oxytoca). arma-mediated aminoglycoside resistance was transferable by conjugation and carried by closely related incl/m plasmids which  also carried ant3"9, dfrxii, sul1, bla(tem-1), and bla(ctx-m-3) genes encoding resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin, trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and ss-lactams, respectively. most of the isolates were genetically different according to pfge but shared similar restriction patterns of the arma -encoding plasmids. our findings highlight the strong association of arma and bla(ctx-m-3)  extended-spectrum ss-lactamase genes across various species in the family enterobacteriaceae . the spread of multiresistant isolates expressing 16s rrna methylases and esbls is a worrisome development requiring continuous monitoring.

TI  == sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  == sitafloxacin hydrate (du-6859a, gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and acinetobacter baumannii. the in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. in a published phase ii randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). results of the phase iii trials of sitafloxacin are not available in english. the clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. the most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders  (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. for japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. while it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and etest.
AB  == the current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical u.s. isolates of target pathogens. findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (bmd) surveillance (d. c. draghi et al., poster d-0701, 46th intersci. conf. antimicrob. agents chemother., san francisco, ca). differences were noted among acinetobacter spp. and serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with streptococcus pyogenes. to address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by bmd and etest. in all, 1,800 staphylococcus aureus, 259 s. pyogenes, 226 streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 enterobacteriaceae, and 227 acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. tigecycline had potent activity by bmd, with >99.6% susceptibility (%s) observed for all pathogens with  interpretive criteria, excluding enterobacter cloacae (98.3% s) and e. faecalis (86.0% s), and mic(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (s. pyogenes/s. pneumoniae) to 1  mug/ml (enterobacteriaceae/a. baumannii). similar profiles were observed by etest, with the exception of a. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens  etest mics trended one doubling-dilution higher than bmd mics. major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding a. baumannii, s. marcescens, and s. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in mics were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline etest for testing s. marcescens, acinetobacter spp., and s. pneumoniae is warranted.

TI  == symptoms and signs of port-related infections in oncology patients related to the offending pathogens.
AB  == aim: there is limited information about symptoms and signs of port-related infections linking to their offending pathogens. methods: oncology patients proven to have port-related infections were retrospectively analysed. we divided  them into two subgroups according to their symptoms and signs. onset of fever and chills with or without hypotension following the port flush was classified as 'port flush form infection'. presence of local inflammatory signs, including erythema, warmth, tenderness and pus formation and systemic infection signs, including fever, chills with or without hypotension was classified as 'local inflammatory form infection'. results: there were 29 episodes of port-related infection among 28 patients, with port flush form 22 episodes and local inflammatory form seven episodes. of 22 episodes of port flush form infections, 20 (91%) were nosocomial glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli, with acinetobacter baumannii (11 episodes, 50%) and enterobacter cloacae (four episodes, 18%) the most common. polymicrobial infections occurred in four episodes (18%). candida infection occurred in two episodes (9%). of seven episodes of local inflammatory form infections, six (86%) were gram-positive cocci, with staphylococcus aureus (five episodes, 71%) the most common. the time  from port implantation to its infection was 272 +/- 255 days (30-993 days) for the port flush form infections and 82 +/- 87 days (22-265 days) for the local inflammatory form infections. this difference was not significant difference (p = 0.068). conclusions: the differences between infection of patients with port flush form and local inflammatory form in incidence and offending microorganism suggest that the aetiology of infection were different.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == carbapenemases: molecular diversity and clinical consequences.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze most beta-lactams including carbapenems. carbapenemases are classified in four molecular classes; those belonging to class a are the chromosomally-encoded and clavulanic acid-inhibited  imi, nmc-a and sme, identified in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens; the plasmid-encoded kpc enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae (and rarely in pseudomonas aeruginosa); and the ges-type enzymes identified in enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. the class b enzymes are the most clinically-significant carbapenemases; they are metallo-beta-lactamases, mostly of the imp and the vim series. they have been reported worldwide and their genes  are plasmid- and integron-located, hydrolyzing all beta-lactams with the exception of aztreonam. one single plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamase, cmy-10,  identified in an enterobacter aerogenes isolate, has been shown to be a cephaslosporinase with some carbapenemase properties. finally, the class d carbapenemases are being increasingly reported, mostly in acinetobacter baumannii, and they compromise the efficacy of imipenem and meropenem significantly.

TI  == preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  == the aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. one hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. on the basis of these results,  80% alcohol, octenidine 0.1%, and chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro  model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and candida albicans. the microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. the results of  the questionnaire revealed that chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and octenidine by 7% of the dentists. using the in vitro model, with the exception of s. aureus, chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. in contrast, the treatment with octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. the 80% alcohol was more efficient. no growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. on the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be  preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or octenidine using an incubation time  of 15 min with ultrasonication.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the vitek 2, disk diffusion, etest, broth microdilution, and agar dilution susceptibility testing methods for colistin in clinical isolates, including heteroresistant enterobacter cloacae and acinetobacter baumannii strains.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria has recently renewed interest in colistin as a therapeutic option. the increasing use of colistin necessitates the availability of rapid and reliable methods for colistin susceptibility testing. we compared seven methods of colistin susceptibility testing (disk diffusion, agar dilution on mueller-hinton [mh] and isosensitest agar, etest on mh and isosensitest agar, broth microdilution, and vitek 2) on 102 clinical isolates collected from patient materials during a selective digestive decontamination or selective oral decontamination trial in an intensive-care unit. disk diffusion is an unreliable method to measure susceptibility to colistin. high error rates and low levels of reproducibility were observed in the disk diffusion test. the colistin etest, agar dilution, and the vitek 2 showed a  high level of agreement with the broth microdilution reference method. heteroresistance for colistin was observed in six enterobacter cloacae isolates and in one acinetobacter baumannii isolate. this is the first report of heteroresistance to colistin in e. cloacae isolates. resistance to colistin in these isolates seemed to be induced upon exposure to colistin rather than being caused by stable mutations. heteroresistant isolates could be detected in the broth microdilution, agar dilution, etest, or disk diffusion test. the vitek 2 displayed low sensitivity in the detection of heteroresistant subpopulations of e. cloacae. the vitek 2 colistin susceptibility test can therefore be considered  to be a reliable tool to determine susceptibility to colistin in isolates of genera that are known not to exhibit resistant subpopulations. in isolates of genera known to (occasionally) exhibit heteroresistance, an alternative susceptibility testing method capable of detecting heteroresistance should be used.

TI  == carbapenemases: the versatile beta-lactamases.
AB  == carbapenemases are beta-lactamases with versatile hydrolytic capacities. they have the ability to hydrolyze penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. bacteria producing these beta-lactamases may cause serious infections in which the carbapenemase activity renders many beta-lactams ineffective. carbapenemases are members of the molecular class a, b, and d beta-lactamases. class a and d enzymes have a serine-based hydrolytic mechanism,  while class b enzymes are metallo-beta-lactamases that contain zinc in the active site. the class a carbapenemase group includes members of the sme, imi, nmc, ges, and kpc families. of these, the kpc carbapenemases are the most prevalent, found  mostly on plasmids in klebsiella pneumoniae. the class d carbapenemases consist of oxa-type beta-lactamases frequently detected in acinetobacter baumannii. the metallo-beta-lactamases belong to the imp, vim, spm, gim, and sim families and have been detected primarily in pseudomonas aeruginosa; however, there are increasing numbers of reports worldwide of this group of beta-lactamases in the enterobacteriaceae. this review updates the characteristics, epidemiology, and detection of the carbapenemases found in pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacteria isolated from intensive care  units of colombian hospitals, whonet 2003, 2004 and 2005].
AB  == introduction: surveillance systems play a key role in the detection and control of bacterial resistance. it is necessary to constantly collect information from all institutions because the mechanisms of bacterial resistance can operate in different ways between countries, cities and even in hospitals in the same area.  therefore local information is important in order to learn about bacterial behaviour and design appropriate interventions for each institution. between january 2003 and december 2004, the centro internacional de entrenamiento e investigaciones medicas (cideim) developed a surveillance project in 10 tertiary  hospitals in 6 cities of colombia. objectives: describe the trends of antibiotic  resistance among the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomona aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae, five of  the most prevalent nosocomial gram negative pathogens. materials and methods: the susceptibility tests were performed by automated methods in 9 hospitals and by kirby bauer in 1 hospital. antibiotics with known activity against gram negatives, according to the clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines, were selected. the laboratories performed internal and external quality controls. during the study period, the information was downloaded monthly from the databases of each microbiology laboratory and sent to cideim where it was centralized in a database using the system whonet 5.3. results: the high resistance rates reported especially for a. baumannii, evidenced the presence of  multidrug resistant bacteria in both icus and wards at every studied institution. conclusions: the creation of a national surveillance network to improve our capabilities to detect, follow up, and control the antibiotic resistance in colombia is urgently needed.

TI  == influence of culture site-specific mic distributions on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of piperacillin/tazobactam and piperacillin: a data analysis.
AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

TI  == epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli  at siriraj hospital, thailand, 2003.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted from august to september, 2003 to determine the prevalence and risk factors in acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing gram-negative bacilli (gnb) in patients admitted to siriraj hospital and the outcomes of these infections. of 346 isolates of gram-negative bacteria in 249 patients, 102 isolates from 87 patients were colonization only, but 244 isolates from 162 patients were infections. the common gnb were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae. the overall prevalence of esbl producers was  30.1%. k. pneumoniae had a very high prevalence of esbl producers (56.9%). the urinary tract was the most common site for esbl- producing gnb infections. nosocomial infections, duration from admission to infection, peripheral line, urinary catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and previous use of beta-lactams, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were associated with acquiring  esbl-producing gnb infections. esbl-producing gnb were significantly more resistant to antimicrobial agents. more than 80% of esbl-producing gnb were susceptible to carbapenems. mortality in patients infected with esbl-producing gnb (41.3%) was significantly higher than those infected with non- esbl-producing gnb (19.8%).

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  == a range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. the antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive acinetobacter  baumannii (bm4454), using a broth culture method. the rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. all five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter species, proteus species and e. coli. the spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. acticoat and contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii. other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with mrsa.

TI  == respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  == bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. no information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than  20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic dna probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == synergistic activities of moxifloxacin combined with piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime against klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of moxifloxacin alone and in combination with cefepime  or piperacillin-tazobactam against clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated by using time-kill methods and antimicrobial concentrations of one-half and one times the  mic. synergy was observed in 58 to 88% of the strains and resulted in bactericidal activity against 60 to 100% of the strains. combinations including moxifloxacin demonstrated enhanced bactericidal activity compared with that of either agent tested alone.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of enterobacteriaceae,  acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. design: ten thousand-subject monte carlo simulation. intervention: variability in total body clearance (clt),  volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem.  for the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the  drug concentrations remain above the mic (%t>mic) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different clt, vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and mic into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% t>mic were calculated. measurements and main results: meropenem free drug %t>mic exposure was significantly greater than that  of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for a. baumannii. for both agents, free drug %t>mic exposure was greatest against enterobacteriaceae and less for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% t>mic were similar between drugs for most bacteria. at 100% t>mic, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and  imipenem attainment was higher for a. baumannii. conclusion: the probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

TI  == preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  == membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. they act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic  antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long)  and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. all the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microm) and high antimicrobial activity. hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. in contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. biacore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward  zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (pc)/egg spingomyelin (sm)/cholesterol) vesicles. all the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (e. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (pg)) vesicles regardless of their length. in contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both pc/sm/cholesterol and pe/pg membranes. attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of pc/cholesterol. the correlation between the antibacterial activity  and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of e. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. the data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.

TI  == emerging carbapenemases in gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == carbapenemases may be defined as beta-lactamases that significantly hydrolyze at  least imipenem or/and meropenem. carbapenemases involved in acquired resistance are of ambler molecular classes a, b, and d. class a, clavulanic acid-inhibited carbapenemases are rare. they are either chromosomally encoded (nmc-a, sme-1 to sme-3, imi-1) in enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, or plasmid encoded, such as kpc-1 in klebsiella pneumoniae and ges-2 in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the latter being a point-mutant of the clavulanic acid-inhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ges-1. the class b enzymes are the most clinically significant carbapenemases. they are metalloenzymes of the imp or vim  series. they have been reported worldwide but mostly from south east asia and europe. metalloenzymes, whose genes are plasmid and integron located, hydrolyze virtually all beta-lactams except aztreonam. finally, the class d carbapenemases  are increasingly reported in acinetobacter baumannii but compromise imipenem and  meropenem susceptibility only marginally. the sources of the acquired carbapenemase genes remain unknown, as does the relative importance of the spread of epidemic strains as opposed to the spread of plasmid- or integron-borne genes. because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in enterobacteriaceae, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection.

TI  == in-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in china.
AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity of arf excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two acinetobacter baumannii, one enterobacter cloacae, three escherichia coli, two helicobacter pylori, one klebsiella pneumoniae and two pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml of bacterial suspension. the excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. a total of 96 rectangular  (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm arf excimer laser, linked with a simple galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original  laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. this system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mj and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. we then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the  repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of arf excimer laser radiation. a critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) cfu (2 x 10(-5)%). these critical values were found to vary  between 8 j/cm2 and 16 j/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. under these conditions, arf laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.

TI  == efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  == effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. this study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with hap. the mean age  of patients was over 70 years. more than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. there was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score between the hap-cefepime and hap-ceftazidime group. the most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with cap were streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 7), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). in patients with hap, p. aeruginosa (n = 13), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), serratia marcescens (n = 6), k. pneumoniae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (n = 5), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and escherichia  coli (n = 2) were isolated. the cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the cap-cefepime group, the hap-cefepime group, and the hap-ceftazidime group, respectively. the increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing cap and hap indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial  agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == [activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against major hospital bacterial pathogens].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. the most prevalent etiologic agents were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), escherichia coli (13.8%),  staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). the most susceptible to cefepime were strains of k. pneumoniae (98.62%), e. coli (98.52%) and e. cloacae (98.19%)  including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. the degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. a. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). this study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by enterobacteriace.

TI  == ceftibuten stability to active-site serine and metallo-beta-lactamases.
AB  == ceftibuten is an oral third-generation cephalosporin active against a wide range  of bacteria and shows an improved stability to hydrolysis by several beta-lactamases because of the carboxyethilidine moiety at position 7 of the ss-acyl side chain. the kinetic interactions between ceftibuten and active-site serine and metallo-ss-lactamases were investigated. the activity of several tem-derived extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbetals) against ceftibuten, cefotaxime and ceftazidime was compared using k(m), k(cat) and k(cat)/k(m). ceftibuten behaved as a poor substrate for class a and b beta-lactamases compared with cefotaxime. the chromosomal class c beta-lactamase from enterobacter cloacae 908r gave a high k(cat) value (21 s(-1)), whereas there was poor activity with enzymes from acinetobacter baumannii and morganella morganii and ceftibuten. ceftibuten resists hydrolysis in the presence of typical respiratory or urogenital-tract pathogens producing beta-lactamases.

TI  == evaluation of current activities of fluoroquinolones against gram-negative bacilli using centralized in vitro testing and electronic surveillance.
AB  == given the propensity for enterobacteriaceae and clinically significant nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli to acquire antimicrobial resistance, consistent surveillance of the activities of agents commonly prescribed to treat  infections arising from these organisms is imperative. this study determined the  activities of two fluoroquinolones, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and seven comparative agents against recent clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia using two surveillance strategies: 1) centralized in vitro susceptibility testing of isolates collected from 27 hospital laboratories across the united states and  2) analysis of data from the surveillance network database-usa, an electronic surveillance network comprising more than 200 laboratories nationwide. regardless of the surveillance method, enterobacteriaceae, p. aeruginosa, and a. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. susceptibilities to the fluoroquinolones approached or exceeded 90% for all enterobacteriaceae except providencia spp. (</=65%). approximately 70% of p. aeruginosa and 50% of a. baumanii isolates were susceptible to both fluoroquinolones. among s. maltophilia isolates, 50% more isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. overall, the rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility among enterobacteriaceae was 8.7%, with fluoroquinolone resistance rates notably higher among ceftazidime-nonsusceptible  isolates than ceftazidime-susceptible ones. multidrug-resistant isolates were present among all species tested but were most prevalent for klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. no gram-negative isolates resistant only to  a fluoroquinolone were encountered, regardless of species. thus, while levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin have maintained potent activity against enterobacteriaceae, the potential for fluoroquinolone resistance, the apparent association between fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, and the presence of multidrug resistance in every species examined emphasize the need to  maintain active surveillance of resistance patterns among gram-negative bacilli.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefepime in the treatment of serious bacterial infections  in hospitalized adult patients.
AB  == proper and timely choice of the antibiotic therapy for the management of infection in hospitalized patients is an immense challenge to the clinician. a newly developed extended-spectrum fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime, has been shown to have good activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. in order to further establish the efficacy and safety of cefepime in the treatment of adult hospitalized patients in taiwan, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who received cefepime therapy for more than 72 h at the national taiwan university hospital during the period from january 1999 to april  1999. a total of 55 patients were treated with cefepime during this period. thirty-two of them were males and 23 were females. their ages ranged from 16 to 94 years old (average, 67). all had severe infections with a mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii (apache ii) score of 18. more than half (56%) of the infections were nosocomial. the most common infections included pulmonary infection (49%), intra-abdominal infection (27%), skin and soft tissue  infection (15%), febrile neutropenia (7%), and intravascular device infection (5%). all but one of the patients (98%) had pre-existing medical disease. malignancy (49%) was the most common underlying illness. pseudomonas aeruginosa (23 isolates) and enterobacter cloacae (21) were the most common pathogens causing infections. thirty-one (58%) of the patients were effectively treated with cefepime. twenty of the patients died during the study period with most deaths attributable to persistent microbial infection and superinfection, especially acinetobacter baumannii and fungal infection. adverse effects developed in six patients, including eosinophilia (3 patients), leukopenia (2), skin rash (1), and drug related fever (1), but all were mild and transient. the results of this study show that cefepime is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of adult patients with severe infection in taiwan.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adult post-neurosurgical patients.
AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == nosocomial gram-negative bacteremia in critically ill patients: epidemiologic characteristics and prognostic factors in 147 episodes.
AB  == although gram-positive organisms are the most common causes of nosocomial bloodstream infections, gram-negative bacteremia carries higher risks of severe sepsis, septic shock, and death among critically ill patients in intensive care units (icus). we performed a prospective epidemiologic analysis of nosocomial gram-negative bacteremia episodes among icu patients and sought to identify risk  factors for mortality among these patients. all episodes of nosocomial gram-negative bacteremia documented in five icu wards of our hospital during a 2-year period were included. there were 147 episodes (124 patients) of gram-negative bacteremia documented during the study period. the overall mortality rate was 36.1%, and 77.4% of all deaths were directly related to the bloodstream infection. gram-negative bacteremia was associated with prolonged icu stay (45.7 d vs 6.1 d for all icu patients). the most common isolate was acinetobacter baumannii, followed by burkholderia cepacia and enterobacter cloacae. the most frequent source of infection was the lower respiratory tract (32.0%). of the agents tested, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and ceftazidime were the  most active against the clinical isolates. multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the presence of septic shock (odds ratio, or = 17.66, p < 0.001) and rapidly fatal and ultimately fatal underlying conditions (or = 3.47, p = 0.032) as being independent risk factors for mortality. early appropriate antibiotic treatment did not result in significant improvement in survival. these findings suggest that prevention of lower respiratory tract colonization and nosocomial pneumonia are crucial for reducing the incidence of nosocomial gram-negative bacteremia in the icu. serious underlying illnesses and septic shock were the most important risk factors for death in these patients.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

AB  == objectives: antibiotic susceptibility of 649 gram-negative bacilli involved in severe infections and isolated in 18 teaching hospitals from january to december  1992 was evaluated. methods: minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by agar dilution method for piperacillin, piperacillin+ tazobactam and imipenem, and by a microdilution method for 11 other antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, ticarcillin, ciprofloxacin,  fosfomycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin). criteria of comite francais de l'antibiogramme de la societe francaise de microbiologie were followed for interpretation. betalactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing and overproduction of cephalosporinase was defined by the resistance phenotype. the main species isolated were escherichia coli (45%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%),  klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8%), salmonella spp. (7.5%), enterobacter cloacae (4%) and klebsiella oxytoca (4%). most of the strains were isolated from blood culture (72.3%), respiratory tract (11.4%) and intraabdominal infections (8.6%). most of  the enterobacteria isolates were susceptible to imipenem, aztreonam, amikacin and ciprofloxacin (percentages of susceptibility were respectively 99.3, 98, 98.3 and 96.3); in most of cases clavulanic acid did not entirely restore sensitivity to amoxicillin of penicillinase-producing strains. among 89 p. aeruginosa strains, 82% were susceptible to imipenem and ceftazidime, 81% to the association piperacillin + tazobactam and 51% to ticarcillin. resistance rates are very high  for acinetobacter baumannii except for imipenem. conclusion: production of tem-type penicillinase and over-production of the chromosomal cephalosporinase are the most widely observed mechanisms of resistance (respectively 22% and 9% of 649 strains). prevalence of extended spectrum betalactamases was low (1%) and essentially observed for k. pneumoniae.

TI  == [kinetics of bactericidal activity of cefepime and cefpirome alone or combined with gentamicin, amikacin or ciprofloxacin against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae hyperproductive in cephalosporinase].
AB  == nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to gram negative bacilli among which stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacter sp. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (fep) and cefpirome (cpo) alone or in combination with amikacin (akn), gentamicin (gtn) or ciprofloxacin (cip) against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. this study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. the combination of fep (4 mg/l) with akn (4 mg/l) against a. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when fep is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. the combination of fep (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. when combined with cip 2 mg/l, fep (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. there were no survival bacteria at 6 h when fep (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and gtn (8 mg/l) at 6 h. used alone fep (1 mg/l) or cpo (1 mg/l) against e. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. combined with akn (2 mg/l), fep (1  mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when cpo at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. these data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new  extended cephalosporins combined with akn, gtn or cip at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.

TI  == [characteristics of multiresistant gram-negative bacteria and their occurrence at the medical school hospital in olomouc].
AB  == currently, a persistent growth of bacterial resistance to antibiotics takes place. multiresistant bacterial strains thus represent a serious danger for therapy in practice. the aim of the study was to characterize the multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria and to judge their antibiograms by using the minimum inhibition concentrations (mic). at the same time the study evaluates the relations to the most frequent diagnoses and epidemiologic data concerning the occurrence of these strains in different clinical cases treated at individual departments of the faculty hospital in olomouc. out of the total of 4.988 strains of gram-negative rods, the number of isolated multiresistant strains reached 316  (6.3%). individual bacterial species were isolated in the following order: pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.8%), enterobacter cloacae (23.4%) and acinetobacter baumannii complex (acb complex) (18.7%). the most frequent occurrence of investigated bacteria was registered at the departments in the following order: urology (45.9%), internal medicine (18%), paediatrics (13.6%), and surgery (11.1%). the most frequent diagnoses based on positive cultivation of these bacteria were the infections of the urogenital tract (53.8%), postoperative infections (16.8%), and the infections of the upper respiratory ducts (7.3%). 64.2% of strains were cultivated from urine, 16.1% from pus, and 6.9% from swabs  taken from the upper respiratory ducts.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == lipopolysaccharide profile typing as a technique for comparative typing of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we have applied the technique of lipopolysaccharide (lps) profiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to the typing of 124 isolates  of 12 gram-negative species from suspected outbreaks of infection. lps was prepared by proteinase k digestion or micro-phenol-water extraction. a total of 11 of the 12 species gave clear ladder band profiles, the exception being acinetobacter baumannii. when compared with conventional typing for enterobacter  cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, lps profile type alone  was sufficient to allow relatedness or distinguishability of isolates to be established, and this was corroborated by serotype and phage type data. serologically nontypeable isolates invariably lacked o repeating units and thus could not be classified by their silver stain profile. we conclude that lps profiling is useful for the epidemiological investigation of small clusters of isolates in order to determine whether or not cross-infection between patients has occurred.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
