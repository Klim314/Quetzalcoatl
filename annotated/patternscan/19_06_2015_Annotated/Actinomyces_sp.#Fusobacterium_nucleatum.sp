TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: neutrophil extracellular trap (net) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. the influence of serum complement on net release therefore remains unclear. we examined the dna release induced by staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: actinomyces viscosus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. material and methods: bacteria-stimulated net release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (cr1, cd35) and 3 (cr3, cd11b/cd18). results: while the presence of serum markedly enhanced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by a. viscosus, there was no enhancement of net release induced by  f. nucleatum. the serum-mediated enhancement of net release by a. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for s. aureus. blockade of cr1, significantly reduced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and a. viscosus, while blockade of cr3, had no effect. however, opsonization of s. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified igg promoted net release. conclusions: in conclusion, complement opsonization promotes net release induced  by a variety of bacteria, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cr1 plays a dominant role in the process. complement consumption or deficiency may compromise netosis induced by some bacterial species, including a. actinomycetemcomitans. within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against netosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == influence of highly-active antiretroviral therapy on the subgingival biofilm in hiv-infected patients.
AB  == aim: highly-active antiretroviral therapy (haart) has been associated with alterations in subgingival biofilm and periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to investigate the association between different haart regimens and the prevalence of periodontal pathogens in hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: subgingival periodontal pathogens were determined by a dna chip microarray in a case series in 14 hiv-infected patients receiving haart  with different drug combinations: protease inhibitor (pi)-based haart versus non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti)-based haart. a statistical analysis was conducted to determine whether specific haart regimens were associated with 10 periodontal pathogens using odds ratios (or). results: at baseline and after treatment, the patients did not show significant clinical and  immunological differences. in general, the highest or for the prevalence of periodontal pathogens were found in the pi haart group for actinomyces viscosus (a. viscosus) (or: 303), campylobacter rectus (or: 90), and treponema denticola (or: 25). in the nnrti haart group, higher or were documented for fusobacterium nucleatum (or: 56) and eikenella corrodens (or: 25). the association between a. viscosus and pi haart was statistically significant (p = 0.03). conclusions: the  results demonstrated statistical associations between subgingival bacteria and antiretroviral drug therapies. further investigation on the clinical significance and underlying mechanisms are needed to support these findings.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == individual growth detection of bacterial species in an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model.
AB  == most in vitro studies on the antibacterial effects of antiseptics have used planktonic bacteria in monocultures. however, this study design does not reflect  the in vivo situation in oral cavities harboring different bacterial species that live in symbiotic relationships in biofilms. the aim of this study was to establish a simple in vitro polymicrobial model consisting of only three bacterial strains of different phases of oral biofilm formation to simulate in vivo oral conditions. therefore, we studied the biofilm formation of actinomyces  naeslundii (an), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), and enterococcus faecalis (ef) on  96-well tissue culture plates under static anaerobic conditions using artificial  saliva according to the method established by pratten et al. that was supplemented with 1 g l(-1) sucrose. growth was separately determined for each bacterial strain after incubation periods of up to 72 h by means of quantitative  real-time polymerase chain reaction and live/dead staining. presence of an extracellular polymeric substance (eps) was visualized by concanavalin a staining. increasing incubation times of up to 72 h showed adhesion and propagation of the bacterial strains with artificial saliva formulation. an and ef had significantly higher growth rates than fn. live/dead staining showed a median of 49.9 % (range 46.0-53.0 %) of living bacteria after 72 h of incubation, and 3d fluorescence microscopy showed a three-dimensional structure containing eps. an in vitro oral polymicrobial biofilm model was established to better simulate oral conditions and had the advantage of providing the well-controlled experimental conditions of in vitro testing.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == microbial evaluation of traumatized teeth treated with triple antibiotic paste or calcium hydroxide with 2% chlorhexidine gel in pulp revascularization.
AB  == introduction: revascularization outcome depends on microbial elimination because  apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. this study evaluated the microbial composition of traumatized immature teeth and assessed their reduction during different stages of the revascularization procedures performed with 2 intracanal medicaments. methods: fifteen patients (7-17 years old) with immature teeth were submitted to the revascularization procedures; they were divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medicament used: tap group (n = 7), medicated with a triple antibiotic paste, and chp group (n = 8), dressed with calcium hydroxide + 2% chlorhexidine gel. samples were taken before any treatment (s1), after irrigation with 6% naocl (s2), after irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine (s3), after intracanal dressing (s4), and after 17% edta irrigation (s5). cultivable bacteria recovered from the 5 stages were counted and identified by means of polymerase chain reaction assay (16s rrna). results: both groups had  colony-forming unit counts significantly reduced after s2 (p < .05); however, no  significant difference was found between the irrigants (s2 and s3, p = .99). no difference in bacteria counts was found between the intracanal medicaments used (p = .95). the most prevalent bacteria detected were actinomyces naeslundii (66.67%), followed by porphyromonas endodontalis, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which were detected in 33.34% of the root canals. an average of 2.13 species per canal was found, and no statistical correlation was observed between bacterial species and clinical/radiographic features. conclusions: the microbial profile of infected immature teeth is similar to that  of primarily infected permanent teeth. the greatest bacterial reduction was promoted by the irrigation solutions. the revascularization protocols that used the tested intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing viable bacteria in necrotic immature teeth.

TI  == red wine and oenological extracts display antimicrobial effects in an oral bacteria biofilm model.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of red wine and its inherent components on oral microbiota were studied by using a 5-species biofilm model of the supragingival plaque that includes actinomyces oris, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar. microbiological analysis (cfu counting and confocal laser scanning microscopy) of the biofilms after the application of red wine, dealcoholized red wine, and red wine extract solutions spiked or not with grape seed and inactive dry yeast extracts showed that the solutions spiked with seed extract were effective against f. nucleatum, s. oralis and a. oris. also, red wine and dealcoholized wine had an antimicrobial effect against f. nucleatum and s. oralis. additional experiments showed almost complete and early degradation of flavan-3-ol precursors [(+)-catechin and procyanidin b2] when incubating biofilms with the red wine extract. to our knowledge, this is the first study of antimicrobial properties of wine in an oral biofilm model.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of a multispecies oral biofilm on different implant surfaces.
AB  == biofilm accumulation on implant surfaces is one of the most important factors for early and late implant failure. because of the related clinical implications, the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the bacterial cell attachment of a four-species oral biofilm on titanium discs of purity grade 2 and 4, with machined surfaces and etched-thermochemically modified with avantblast(r). the in vitro biofilm model was composed of early (actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus  gordonii), secondary (veillonella parvula), and intermediate (fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum) colonizers of tooth surfaces. a total of 36 discs were divided into four groups: tigr2-c (titanium grade 2, machined surface), tigr2-t (titanium grade 2, modified surface with avantblast(r)), tigr4-c (titanium grade 4, machined surface), tigr4-t (titanium grade 4, modified surface with avantblast(r)). the experiment was repeated three times. biofilm viability was tested with 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution and bacterial cell quantification by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate biofilm composition and differences between groups were checked with the mann-whitney test (p < 0.05). after one week, multispecies biofilms showed a similar pattern of bacterial composition on all analyzed implant surfaces. the most prevalent bacterium was v. parvula ( approximately 50% of the total biomass), followed by s. gordonii ( approximately 30%), f. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum ( approximately 10%) and a. naeslundii (<5%). total bacterial biomass was significantly higher in both grade-4-titanium surfaces (p < 0.05). the results demonstrated that not only implant surface treatment, but also titanium purity, influence early bacterial colonization.

TI  == salivary pellicle composition and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the salivary  pellicle (sp) and multispecies biofilm developed on titanium nitrided by cold plasma. methods: titanium discs were allocated into a control group (ti) and an experimental group (tin - titanium-nitrided by cold plasma). the disc surface topography was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (sem) and atomic force microscopy (afm). the chemical composition of the disc surface was determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). stimulated, clarified, and  filtered saliva was used to form pellicles on the discs. proteome analysis of the adsorbed sp proteins was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc-ms). the surface free energy (sfe) was evaluated before and after sp formation. a multispecies biofilm composed of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella  dispar, and candida albicans was developed on the sp-coated discs. viable microorganism counts were determined. the biomass and average thickness of biofilms were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (clsm) with comstat  software. the biofilm organization was visualized by sem. results: the surface topography was similar in both groups. the sfe of the tin group did not differ from that of the ti group (p>0.05), although the adsorption of pellicle proteins  increased the sfe in both pellicle-coated groups (p<0.001). different proteins were identified on the ti and tin surfaces. the amount of biofilm was similar for both groups (p=0.416), but the counts of f. nucleatum and s. oralis were higher in the tin group (p<0.001). similar biofilms were characterized by the comstat data, clsm images, and sem images. conclusion: the titanium nitrided by cold plasma exhibited differences in sp composition and multispecies microbial biofilm population compared to the control titanium surface.

TI  == new bacterial composition in primary and persistent/secondary endodontic infections with respect to clinical and radiographic findings.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to analyze the microbiota of primary and secondary/persistent endodontic infections of patients undergoing endodontic treatment with respect to clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples from the root canals of 21 german patients were taken using 3 sequential  sterile paper points. in the case of a root canal filling, gutta-percha was removed with sterile files, and samples were taken using sterile paper points. the samples were plated, and microorganisms were then isolated and identified morphologically by biochemical analysis and sequencing the 16s rrna genes of isolated microorganisms. results: in 12 of 21 root canals, 33 different species could be isolated. six (50%) of the cases with isolated microorganisms were primary, and 6 (50%) cases were endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth. twelve of the isolated species were facultative anaerobic and 21 obligate  anaerobic. monomicrobial infections were found for enterococcus faecalis and actinomyces viscosus. e. faecalis was most frequently isolated in secondary endodontic infections (33%). moraxella osloensis was isolated from a secondary endodontic infection that had an insufficient root canal filling accompanied by a mild sensation of pain. a new bacterial composition compromising atopobium rimae, anaerococcus prevotii, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, dialister invisus, and fusobacterium nucleatum was recovered from teeth with chronic apical abscesses. conclusions: new bacterial combinations were found and correlated to clinical and radiographic findings, particularly to chronic apical abscesses. m. osloensis was detected in root canals for the second time and only in german patients.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == massive parallel sequencing provides new perspectives on bacterial brain abscesses.
AB  == rapid development within the field of massive parallel sequencing (mps) is about  to bring this technology within reach for diagnostic microbiology laboratories. we wanted to explore its potential for improving diagnosis and understanding of polymicrobial infections, using bacterial brain abscesses as an example. we conducted a prospective nationwide study on bacterial brain abscesses. fifty-two  surgical samples were included over a 2-year period. the samples were categorized as either spontaneous intracerebral, spontaneous subdural, or postoperative. bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified directly from the specimens and sequenced using ion torrent technology, with an average of 500,000 reads per sample. the results were compared to those from culture- and sanger sequencing-based diagnostics. compared to culture, mps allowed for triple the number of bacterial  identifications. aggregatibacter aphrophilus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus intermedius or combinations of them were found in all spontaneous polymicrobial abscesses. f. nucleatum was systematically detected in samples with anaerobic flora. the increased detection rate for actinomyces spp. and facultative gram-negative rods further revealed several species associations. we  suggest that a. aphrophilus, f. nucleatum, and s. intermedius are key pathogens for the establishment of spontaneous polymicrobial brain abscesses. in addition,  f. nucleatum seems to be important for the development of anaerobic flora. mps can accurately describe polymicrobial specimens when a sufficient number of reads is used to compensate for unequal species concentrations and principles are defined to discard contaminant bacterial dna in the subsequent data analysis. this will contribute to our understanding of how different types of polymicrobial infections develop.

TI  == multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-fish) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) to analyze multispecies oral biofilms.
AB  == multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-fish) constitutes a favorable microbiological method for the analysis of spatial distribution of highly variable phenotypes found in multispecies oral biofilms. the combined use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) produces high-resolution three-dimensional (3d) images of individual bacteria in their natural environment. here, we describe the application of m-fish on early (streptococcus  spp., actinomyces naeslundii) and late colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella spp.) of in situ-formed oral biofilms, the acquisition of clsm images, as well as the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these digitally obtained and processed images.

TI  == in vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  == purpose: this in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. the role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was  also evaluated. materials and methods: the efficacy of three oral rinses, acclean, noplak and prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an mtt assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an xtt assay. results: the two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio  lm-grown organisms when compared to the prevention oral rinse. conclusion: both acclean and noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. in addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  == background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite,  and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to  epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.

TI  == multi-centre evaluation of mass spectrometric identification of anaerobic bacteria using the vitek(r) ms system.
AB  == accurate and timely identification of anaerobic bacteria is critical to successful treatment. classic phenotypic methods for identification require long  turnaround times and can exhibit poor species level identification. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) is an identification method that can provide rapid identification  of anaerobes. we present a multi-centre study assessing the clinical performance  of the vitek((r)) ms in the identification of anaerobic bacteria. five different  test sites analysed a collection of 651 unique anaerobic isolates comprising 11 different genera. multiple species were included for several of the genera. briefly, anaerobic isolates were applied directly to a well of a target plate. matrix solution (alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) was added and allowed to dry. mass spectra results were generated with the vitek((r)) ms, and the comparative spectral analysis and organism identification were determined using the vitek((r)) ms database 2.0. results were confirmed by 16s rrna gene sequencing. of the 651 isolates analysed, 91.2% (594/651) exhibited the correct species identification. an additional eight isolates were correctly identified to genus level, raising the rate of identification to 92.5%. genus-level identification consisted of actinomyces, bacteroides and prevotella species. fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces neuii and bacteroides uniformis were notable for an increased percentage of no-identification results compared with the other  anaerobes tested. vitek((r)) ms identification of clinically relevant anaerobes is highly accurate and represents a dramatic improvement over other phenotypic methods in accuracy and turnaround time.

TI  == photodynamic biofilm inactivation by sapyr--an exclusive singlet oxygen photosensitizer.
AB  == prevention and control of biofilm-growing microorganisms are serious problems in  public health due to increasing resistances of some pathogens against antimicrobial drugs and the potential of these microorganisms to cause severe infections in patients. therefore, alternative approaches that are capable of killing pathogens are needed to supplement standard treatment modalities. one alternative is the photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib). the lethal effect of pib is based on the principle that visible light activates a photosensitizer,  leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species, e.g., singlet oxygen, which  induces phototoxicity immediately during illumination. sapyr is a new generation  of photosensitizers. based on a 7-perinaphthenone structure, it shows a singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of 99% and is water soluble and photostable. moreover, it contains a positive charge for good adherence to cell walls of pathogens. in this study, the pib properties of sapyr were investigated against monospecies and polyspecies biofilms formed in vitro by oral key pathogens. sapyr showed a dual mechanism of action against biofilms: (i) it disrupts the structure of the biofilm even without illumination; (ii) when irradiated, it inactivates bacteria in a polymicrobial biofilm after one single treatment with an efficacy of >/= 99.99%. these results encourage further investigation on the potential of  pib using sapyr for the treatment of localized infectious diseases.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == in vivo study of the initial bacterial adhesion on different implant materials.
AB  == objective: biofilm formation on implant materials plays a major role in the aetiology of periimplantitis. the aim of this study was to examine in vivo the initial bacterial adhesion on six different implant materials. methods: the implant materials ti-m, tiunite(r), ziunite(r), atz-m, atz-s, tzp-a-m were tested using bovine enamel slabs as controls. all materials, fixed on splint systems, were examined after 30 min and 120 min of oral exposure. dapi staining was used for quantitative analysis of the initially adherent microorganisms. initial adherent microorganisms were visualised by fluorescence in situ-hybridisation (fish) and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). the targets of the oligonucleotide probes were eubacteria, veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus spp. results: dapi analysis showed that increasing the time of oral exposure resulted in an increasing amount of initial adherent bacteria. the highest level of colonisation was on ziunite(r), with the lowest occurring on the bovine enamel, followed by ti-m. this early colonisation correlated significantly with the surface roughnesses of  the materials. fish and clsm showed no significant differences relating to total  bacterial composition. however, streptococcus spp. was shown to be the main colonisers on each of the investigated materials. conclusion: it could be shown that within an oral exposure time of 30 min and 120 min, despite the salivary acquired pellicle initial biofilm formation is mainly influenced directly or indirect by the material surface topography. highly polished surfaces should minimise the risk of biofilm formation, plaque accumulation and possibly periimplantitis.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies microbial biofilms.
AB  == this report describes the use of a novel model of multispecies biofilms to stimulate profiles of cytokines/chemokines from oral epithelial cells that contribute to local inflammation in the periodontium. streptococcus gordonii (sg)/s. oralis (so)/s. sanguinis (ss) and sg/fusobacterium nucleatum (fn)/porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) biofilms elicited significantly elevated levels of il-1alpha and showed synergistic stimulatory activity compared with an  additive effect of the 3 individual bacteria. only the sg/actinomyces naeslundii  (an)/fn multispecies biofilms elicited il-6 levels above those of control. il-8 was a primary response to the sg/an/fn biofilms, albeit the level was not enhanced compared with a predicted composite level from the monospecies challenges. these results represent some of the first data documenting alterations in profiles of oral epithelial cell responses to multispecies biofilms.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

AB  == background: fusobacterium species are uncommon causes of osteomyelitis. these organisms are normal flora of the oral cavity. therefore, they mostly cause osteomyelitis of the head and neck. hematogenous osteomyelitis at distant sites other than the head and neck has rarely been reported in pediatric or immunocompromised patients. here, we report the first case of osteomyelitis of a  long bone combined with a muscle abscess due to fusobacterium nucleatum in an otherwise healthy adult. case presentation: a 59-year-old korean man was admitted for pain and swelling of the right lower leg, which had been persistent for two weeks. magnetic resonance imaging showed osteomyelitis of the right fibula with a surrounding muscle abscess of the right lower leg. incision and drainage was performed, and repetitive tissue cultures grew f. nucleatum. in this patient, it  was presumed that recurrent periodontitis caused hematogenous seeding of f. nucleatum to a distant site leading to osteomyelitis with a muscle abscess. the patient was successfully treated with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam for three  weeks and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for eight weeks. he also underwent repeated surgical drainage. he has no evidence of recurrence after seven months of follow-up. conclusions: clinicians should be aware that f. nucleatum could be  the etiologic agent of hematogenous osteomyelitis of a long bone in an immunocompetent patient.

AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == strain-specific colonization patterns and serum modulation of multi-species oral  biofilm development.
AB  == periodontitis results from an ecological shift in the composition of subgingival  biofilms. subgingival community maturation is modulated by inter-organismal interactions and the relationship of communities with the host. in an effort to better understand this process, we evaluated biofilm formation, with oral commensal species, by three strains of the subgingivally prevalent microorganism  fusobacterium nucleatum and four strains of the periodontopathogen porphyromonas  gingivalis. we also tested the effect of serum, which resembles gingival exudates, on subgingival biofilms. biofilms were allowed to develop in flow cells using salivary medium. we found that although not all strains of f. nucleatum were able to grow in mono-species biofilms, forming a community with health-associated partners actinomyces oris and veillonella parvula promoted biofilm growth of all f. nucleatum strains. strains of p. gingivalis also showed  variable ability to form mono-species biofilms. p. gingivalis w50 and w83 did not form biofilms, while atcc 33277 and 381 formed biofilm structures, but only strain atcc 33277 grew over time. unlike the enhanced growth of f. nucleatum with the two health-associated species, no strain of p. gingivalis grew in three-species communities with a. oris and v. parvula. however, addition of f. nucleatum facilitated growth of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 with health-associated partners. importantly, serum negatively affected the adhesion of f. nucleatum, while it favored biofilm growth by p. gingivalis. this work highlights strain specificity in subgingival biofilm formation. environmental factors such as serum alter the colonization patterns of oral microorganisms and could impact subgingival biofilms by selectively promoting pathogenic species.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of mtad and nisin in combination against common pathogens associated with root canal infection.
AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

AB  == objectives: this study aimed to evaluate antimicrobial effects of an o-cymen-5-ol/zinc system. methods: o-cymen-5-ol and zinc gluconate minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were  determined against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and candida albicans. synergy was investigated by checkerboard mic/mbc; inhibition of p. gingivalis protease activity and s. mutans glycolysis were investigated. slurried toothpastes containing the system were assessed in kill time assays against s. mutans and e.  coli. results: o-cymen-5-ol mic was between 1.7 mm to 3.4 mm; mbc was 3.4 mm to 6.7 mm. zinc gluconate mic was 2.8 mm to 11 mm; mbc was between 11 mm and >44 mm. the two agents in solution showed synergy (fici</=0.50) against p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, with mic of 0.42 mm/0.69 mm for o-cymen-5-ol/zinc gluconate, respectively. zinc inhibited glycolysis and protease to a greater degree than o-cymen-5-ol; glycolysis inhibition by the two agents was additive. o-cymen-5-ol/zinc chloride in toothpaste showed greater effects than placebo (120s log10 kill=7.35+/-0.40 and 4.02+/-0.40, respectively). conclusions: the zinc/o-cymen-5-ol system has direct antimicrobial effects and inhibits oral disease-related processes. synergistic effects were seen against anaerobes. a system combining o-cymen-5-ol and zinc shows properties desirable for incorporation in toothpastes.

TI  == microbiological aspects of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.
AB  == clinical, microbiological, and biochemical features of human mandibular subperiosteal dental implants exhibiting peri-implantitis were compared with those experiencing long-term peri-implant health. after evaluation of clinical parameters, submucosal plaque samples were obtained from permucosal implant abutment posts exhibiting probing depths >/=5 mm and bleeding on probing in subjects with peri-implantitis (n = 3) and from posts with peri-implant health in subjects with long-term subperiosteal implant health (n = 8). the microbial specimens were transported in vmga iii and plated onto enriched brucella blood agar and hammond's selective medium with anaerobic incubation, and onto selective tsbv with 5% co2 incubation. total anaerobic viable counts and selected bacterial species were identified using established phenotypic methods and criteria. in vitro resistance to doxycycline (2 mug/ml), amoxicillin (2 mug/ml), or metronidazole (4 mug/ml) was recorded per subject when bacterial pathogen growth  was noted on antibiotic-supplemented isolation plates. interleukin (il)-1beta levels were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peri-implant crevicular fluid samples from 5 study subjects. significantly higher plaque index scores, higher total anaerobic viable counts, more red complex species, and lower proportions of gram-positive facultative viridans streptococci and actinomyces species were detected on peri-implantitis-affected subperiosteal implants as compared with subperiosteal implants with long-term peri-implant health. no in vitro resistance to the 3 test antibiotic breakpoint concentrations studied was found, except a fusobacterium nucleatum strain resistant to doxycycline at 2 mug/ml from 1 peri-implantitis subject. subperiosteal implants with peri-implantitis tended to yield higher peri-implant crevicular fluid il-1beta levels. the level of peri-implant supramucosal plaque control and the composition of the peri-implant submucosal microbiome may be important determinants of the long-term clinical status of mandibular subperiosteal dental implants.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. methodology: fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kd, 10 kd, 40 kd, 70 kd, 2000 kd) were used as a series of diffusion probes. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces naeslundii and fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. the diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. results: mathematical function of biofilm penetration  was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and  molecule weights. conclusion: this can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

AB  == background: our goal was to examine differences in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses to non-surgical mechanical therapy in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (gcp) and generalized aggressive periodontitis  (gagp). methods: twenty patients with gcp and 14 patients with gagp were evaluated. clinical data, gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline and 3 months after non-surgical periodontal treatment. levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta, -4, and -8 and interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) were analyzed using a multiplexed bead immunoassay,  and elastase activity was measured using an enzymatic assay. the significance of  changes with time was examined using the wilcoxon rank sum test. changes in clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic parameters after therapy were compared between groups using the mann-whitney u test. results: after periodontal therapy, we found significant improvements for all clinical parameters in both groups. we  also observed significant reductions in elastase activity in shallow and deep sites from the gagp group and in deep sites from the gcp group. microbiologic data showed significant reductions in proportions of orange and red complexes and an increase in proportions of actinomyces species in both clinical groups. when the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic responses after therapy were compared between groups, only minor differences were found. conclusion: this study fails to show any significant differences between severe forms of gcp and gagp in response to non-surgical periodontal treatment.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == development of a novel multi-triplex qpcr method for the assessment of bacterial  community structure in oral populations.
AB  == gingivitis and dental caries are two of the most predominant diseases in humans.  both conditions are easily treated with the removal of the plaque biofilm by brushing or the use of oral hygiene products. in both cases, pathogenic taxa found within the plaque biofilm are the causal agents of the disease. actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotalla intermedia have all been implicated in the development of gingivitis, while streptococcus mutans is the main organism associated with dental caries. many studies have so far focused on  the use of culture methods to detect and enumerate the pathogenic taxa within plaque samples. however, these methods are both labour intensive and biased towards culturable taxa. in the present study, a novel high-throughput multi-triplex quantitative pcr method was developed with the aim to investigate the community dynamics associated with oral communities. three triplex assays were designed targeting taxa associated with gingivitis and dental caries as well as oral health. saliva samples collected from healthy individuals were used in order to validate the newly developed method.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  == composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally  invasive repair. here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. it is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.

TI  == potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  == effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. this was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove  calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy  output of 0.4 mj/mm(2) at 3 hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium  power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. in a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. they were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (n = 6/group) using identical settings. biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (p </= 0.0001). however, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (p </= 0.0001). the extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. to increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. this novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.

AB  == coaggregation is an interspecies adhesion process, which is essential to the development of dental plaque. this is an in vitro study of the composition of the soluble solids in the berry juice molecular size fractions (<10 kda, fi; 10-100 kda, fii; >100 kda, fiii) derived from apple, bilberry, blackcurrant, cloudberry, crowberry and lingonberry and their ability to inhibit and reverse coaggregation  of the pairs of common species in dental plaque: streptococcus mutans with fusobacterium nucleatum or actinomyces naeslundii. inhibitory and reversal activity was found in the molecular size fractions fii and fiii of bilberry, blackcurrant, crowberry and lingonberry. the active fractions contained higher amounts of polyphenols (5-12% of soluble solids) than those without activity (<2% of soluble solids). proanthocyanidins dominated in the active lingonberry juice fractions fii and fiii and also small amounts of anthocyanins were detected. anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides were prevalent in fii and fiii fractions of bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices. comparable amounts of sugars and titratable acids were present in the latter three berry juice fractions of different size. the results indicate that the high molecular size fractions of lingonberry, bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices have antiaggregation potential on common oral bacteria, the potential being associated with their polyphenolic content.

TI  == differential and coordinated expression of defensins and cytokines by gingival epithelial cells and dendritic cells in response to oral bacteria.
AB  == background: epithelial cells and dendritic cells (dcs) both initiate and contribute to innate immune responses to bacteria. however, much less is known about the coordinated regulation of innate immune responses between gecs and immune cells, particularly dcs in the oral cavity. the present study was conducted to investigate whether their responses are coordinated and are bacteria-specific in the oral cavity. results: the beta-defensin antimicrobial peptides hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 were expressed by immature dcs as well as gingival epithelial cells (gecs). hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 are upregulated in dcs while hbd2 and hbd3 are upregulated in gecs in response to bacterial stimulation. responses  of both cell types were bacteria-specific, as demonstrated by distinctive profiles of hbds mrna expression and secreted cytokines and chemokines in response to cell wall preparations of various bacteria of different pathogenicity: fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii and porphyromonas  gingivalis. the regulation of expression of hbd2, il-8, cxcl2/grobeta and ccl-20/mip3alpha by gecs was greatly enhanced by conditioned medium from bacterially activated dcs. this enhancement was primarily mediated via il-1beta,  since induction was largely attenuated by il-1 receptor antagonist. in addition,  the defensins influence dcs by eliciting differential cytokine and chemokine secretion. hbd2 significantly induced il-6, while hbd3 induced mcp-1 to approximately the same extent as lps, suggesting a unique role in immune responses. conclusions: the results suggest that cytokines, chemokines and beta-defensins are involved in interaction of these two cell types, and the responses are bacteria-specific. differential and coordinated regulation between  gecs and dcs may be important in regulation of innate immune homeostasis and response to pathogens in the oral cavity.

TI  == oral biofilm architecture on natural teeth.
AB  == periodontitis and caries are infectious diseases of the oral cavity in which oral biofilms play a causative role. moreover, oral biofilms are widely studied as model systems for bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and biofilm resistance to antibiotics, due to their widespread presence and accessibility. despite descriptions of initial plaque formation on the tooth surface, studies on mature  plaque and plaque structure below the gum are limited to landmark studies from the 1970s, without appreciating the breadth of microbial diversity in the plaque. we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize in vivo the most abundant species from different phyla and species associated with periodontitis on seven embedded teeth obtained from four different subjects. the data showed convincingly the dominance of actinomyces sp., tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, spirochaetes, and synergistetes in subgingival plaque. the latter proved to be new with a possibly important role in host-pathogen interaction due to its localization in close proximity to immune cells. the present study identified for the first time in vivo that lactobacillus sp. are the central cells of bacterial aggregates in subgingival plaque, and that streptococcus sp. and the yeast candida albicans form corncob structures in supragingival plaque. finally, periodontal pathogens colonize already formed biofilms and form microcolonies therein. these in vivo observations on oral biofilms provide a clear vision on biofilm architecture and the spatial distribution of predominant species.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

AB  == background: the aim of the study was to assess the bacterial community structures associated with endodontic infections using terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism (t-rflp), and to investigate the correlation of whole community profiles with the manifestation of particular clinical features. methods: intraradicular samples were collected from 34 subjects and classified into three  study groups based on the observed clinical symptoms: acute (n = 16), sub-acute (n = 8), and asymptomatic (n = 10). genomic dna was extracted from each sample, submitted to polymerase chain reaction using a fluorescently labeled 16s ribosomal dna forward primer, and digested with two tetrameric endonucleases (hhai and mspi). the terminal restriction fragments (t-rfs) were subsequently discriminated in an automated dna sequencer, and the results were filtered using  a statistics-based criterion. results: totals of 138 (hhai) and 145 (mspi) unique t-rfs were detected (means 13.1 and 11.9) and there was high inter-subject variability in the bacterial assemblages. odds-ratio analysis unveiled the existence of higher order groups of positively associated t-rfs, restating the concept that intricate ecological relationships may take place in the root canal  space. a significantly greater t-rf prevalence was detected in acute cases, suggesting a straight correlation between species richness and spontaneous pain.  conclusion: overall, no t-rflp profile representing a specific bacterial consortium could be associated with the manifestation of symptoms of endodontic origin.

TI  == change in diet and oral hygiene over an 8-week period: effects on oral health and oral biofilm.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor changes in oral health and oral biofilm composition in vivo during an experiment simulating prehistoric lifestyle and diet and poor oral hygiene. thirteen subjects lived for a period of 8 weeks under neolithic conditions. the following clinical parameters were recorded before and  after the project: gingival and plaque index (loe and silness, acta odontol scand 21:533, 1963; silness and loe, acta odontol scand 22:121-135, 1964), probing pocket depth, and bleeding upon probing. in addition, supragingival plaque samples were collected both before and after the project and were analysed quantitatively using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. the following plaque bacteria were evaluated: streptococcus spp., veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces naeslundii. the plaque index increased significantly from 1.12 up to 1.55 over the 8-week period (gingival index before, 0.46; after, 0.93; p < 0.05). a strong  correlation of both indices was recorded before (r = 0.77) and after (r = 0.83) participation in the study. each of the children in the study showed a progression of carious lesions and/or new areas of demineralisation. the probing  pocket depth and bleeding upon probing were not affected. all subjects yielded an intra-individual shift in biofilm composition. the proportion of f. nucleatum decreased across all subjects. the proportion of veillonella spp. increased among the children. poor oral hygiene and change of diet lead to an increase in oral plaque and gingival inflammation. the inter-individual comparison indicated a shift in bacterial composition.

TI  == bacterial colonization of enamel in situ investigated using fluorescence in situ  hybridization.
AB  == oral biofilms are one of the greatest challenges in dental research. the present  study aimed to investigate initial bacterial colonization of enamel surfaces in situ using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) over a 12 h period. for this purpose, bovine enamel slabs were fixed on buccal sites of individual splints worn by six subjects for 2, 6 and 12 h to allow biofilm formation. specimens were processed for fish and evaluated with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, using probes for eubacteria, streptococcus species, veillonella species, fusobacterium  nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii. the number of adherent bacteria increased with time and all tested bacterial species were detected in the biofilm formed in situ. the general percentage composition of the eubacteria did not change over the investigated period, but the number of streptococci, the most frequently detected species, increased significantly with time (2 h: 17.7+/-13.8 %; 6 h: 20.0+/-16.6 %; 12 h: 24.7+/-16.1 %). however, < or =1 % of the surface was covered with bacteria after 12 h of biofilm formation in situ. in conclusion, fish is an appropriate method for quantifying initial biofilm formation in situ,  and the proportion of streptococci increases during the first 12 h of bacterial adherence.

TI  == multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  == purpose: this laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). materials and methods: rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. the biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material,  and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (n = 9/group) surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. results: no difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. after a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (p < or = 0.001). conclusions: surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth  and maturation. the multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for  studying plaque formation.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 requires actinomyces naeslundii atcc 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes streptococcus oralis  34.
AB  == formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. the unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. we investigated the integration  of fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. in flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr (q-pcr) using species-specific primers. unable to grow as single-species biofilms, f. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with actinomyces naeslundii but not with streptococcus oralis. however, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the f. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-pcr analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of  the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. lower numbers of cells were observed  at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. integration of f. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates  with a. naeslundii and s. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of a. naeslundii.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  == effect of xylitol on an in vitro model of oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the present study was to examine whether xylitol, at different concentrations, inhibits the formation of an experimental model of oral biofilm. materials and methods: biofilms of six bacterial species (streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) were prepared on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs according to the zurich biofilm model. xylitol was tested at two concentrations, 1% and 3%. at the end of their designated incubation times, some ha discs were destined for confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and the others were harvested using a sterile surgical instrument. aliquots of harvested biofilms were diluted and plated onto specific  media. after a 48-h anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the colony-forming units (cfus) were counted. results: clsm images showed that only a small amount of isolated bacteria was observed on the surface of ha discs. culture of harvested biofilms showed an inhibition in the growth of different species included in the biofilms. conclusions: xylitol has a clear inhibitory effect on the formation of the experimental biofilms. this study shows that xylitol is not  only efficient in inhibiting the acid production of cariogenic bacteria, but also in preventing the formation of a multispecies biofilm; it confirms the relevance  of the use of this polyol for the prevention of oral diseases caused by dental plaque.

TI  == [bacteriological analysis of subgingival plaque in adolescents].
AB  == objective: to investigate the changes in characteristics of periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with puberty gingivitis and its relevance with  clinical symptoms. methods: a total of 108 subgingival plaque samples were collected from 30 patients with puberty gingivitis (group g), 9 cases of chronic  periodontitis (group p) and 15 healthy controls (group h). the age of the 54 participants was from 11 to 17. the black-pigmented bacteria (bpb), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), actinomyces were detected using bacterial culture. the probing depth (pd), gingival index (gi), bleeding index (bi) and attachment loss (al) were also recorded. results: in all  these three groups, the detection rates of black-pigmented bacteria were: 3%, 30% and 100%; fn were: 30%, 68% and 94%, statistically significantly different (p < 0.01). the lgcfu/ml of black-pigmented bacteria and actinomyces was higher in mild-moderate group [(3.8 +/- 0.7) and (5.3 +/- 0.9)] than in group h (p < 0.001). the lgcfu/ml of black-pigmented bacteria and fn significantly was higher  in severe inflammation group [(4.7 +/- 1.2) and (4.4 +/- 0.8)] than in the mild-moderate group (p < 0.01). the lgcfu/ml of black-pigmented bacteria, fn and  aa was higher in severe gingivitis group [(6.6 +/- 1.0), (5.5 +/- 1.0) and (4.2 +/- 1.7)] than in mild gingivitis group (p < 0.01). the detection rate and lgcfu/ml of black-pigmented bacteria, fn and aa were both positively correlated with bi, pd and al. conclusions: in the stage of severe gingivitis, the periodontal pathogens increased markedly, suggesting that risk of further destruction of periodontal tissue may exist.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. i. plaque mass.
AB  == background and objective: little is known about the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to examine the relationship between total dna probe counts of supragingival biofilm  samples, clinical parameters and supragingival biofilm composition. material and  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 187 systemically healthy adult subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the relationship between total dna probe counts and microbial composition was examined by subsetting the data into 10 groups based on 10 percentile increments  of the total dna probe counts. differences among groups in terms of species counts and proportions were sought, as well as relationships of total plaque dna  probe count and clinical parameters. results: there was a wide distribution in mean total dna probe counts among the 187 subjects. with increasing total plaque  levels there was a change in the proportions of individual species and microbial  complexes. 'small plaques' were characterized by high proportions of species in the yellow, orange, purple and 'other' complexes; plaques of moderate mass were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces and purple complex species, while 'large plaques' exhibited increased proportions of green and orange complex species. measures of gingival inflammation, pocket depth and recession were significantly positively associated with total dna probe counts. increased plaque numbers were related to increased pocket depth irrespective of presence or absence of gingival inflammation. conclusion: the proportions of individual species and microbial complexes in supragingival biofilms are influenced by the total numbers of organisms in the biofilm.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == rapid identification of oral anaerobic bacteria cultivated from subgingival biofilm by maldi-tof-ms.
AB  == introduction: to facilitate the identification of anaerobes cultivated from periodontal disease, whole cell bacterial identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) was evaluated. methods: a total of 84 strains (nine reference strains and 75 recent clinical isolates from 33 patients with aggressive periodontitis) previously identified with phenotypic methods were used. all the references and 10 clinical  isolates belonging to the same species as the reference strains were genotypically identified by sequence analysis of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. all  the strains were then analyzed using maldi-tof-ms. results: the reference strains of anaerobic bacteria used showed characteristic maldi-tof-ms spectra with peaks  between m/z 2000 and up to about m/z 13,000. on visual inspection, the similarity of spectra produced by strains of a single genus could be recognized. obvious differences between spectra produced by strains of different species were also easily noticed. the reproducibility of the method was proved by the similarity of spectra belonging to the same species. the spectra of the prevotella intermedia strains identified with maldi clustered together and clustered separately from the spectra of prevotella nigrescens, proving that maldi-tof-ms is an accurate method that is capable of separating these two species. the quality of clustering was characterized by calculating an inconsistency coefficient (mathworks:/matlab  reference manual v2007a/, statistical toolbox). conclusion: our results suggest that maldi-tof-ms might become a useful method for the identification of anaerobic bacteria, especially for those that cannot be readily identified by biochemical analysis. it may become an attractive system even for the routine identification of clinical isolates.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

AB  == with the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use er:yag lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. we examined their effects against biofilms  made of actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, propionibacterium acnes, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, or prevotella nigrescens in vitro. after er:yag laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 j/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. the er:yag laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by l. casei. after irradiation, the  numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. er: yag lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.

TI  == coaggregation between and among human intestinal and oral bacteria.
AB  == coaggregation is believed to facilitate the integration of new bacterial species  into polymicrobial communities. the aim of this study was to investigate coaggregation between and among human oral and enteric bacteria. stationary phase cultures of 10 oral and 10 enteric species, chosen on the basis of numerical and  ecological significance in their respective environments together with their ease of cultivation, were tested using a quantitative spectrophotometric coaggregation assay in all possible pairwise combinations to provide quantitative coaggregation scores. while 40% of possible partnerships coaggregated strongly for oral strains, strong interactions between oral and gut strains were considerably less  common (4% incidence). coaggregation scores were also weak between members of the intestinal microbiota (7% incidence), apart from bacteroides fragilis with clostridium perfringens, and bifidobacterium adolescentis with c. perfringens. oral and intestinal bacteria did not strongly interact, apart from b. adolescentis with fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii with c. perfringens and f. nucleatum with lactobacillus paracasei. heating and sugar-addition experiments indicated that similar to oral microorganisms, interactions within intestinal bacteria and between intestinal and oral strains were mediated by lectin-carbohydrate interactions.

AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == a novel tem contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  == in the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. in addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (eps) has not satisfactorily been solved. here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (tem) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. sufficient contrast was  achieved by replacing schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. in addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. all six members of the biofilm consortium (streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium  nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans) could be distinguished.  within the matrix, structural differences of eps, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of s. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of s. oralis microcolonies. the ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for tem using this method allows the imaging  of undistorted eps as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. this is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.

AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == the in vivo dynamics of streptococcus spp., actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella spp. in dental plaque biofilm as analysed by five-colour multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization.
AB  == the formation and composition of dental plaque biofilm in vivo are important factors which influence the development of gingivitis, caries and periodontitis.  studying dental plaque biofilm in in vitro models can cause an oversimplification of the real conditions in the oral cavity. in this study, bovine enamel slabs were fixed in an individual acrylic appliance in situ to quantify dental plaque formation and composition using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. each of the five oligonucleotide probes used for fish was specific for either eubacteria or one of four frequently isolated bacterial constituents belonging to early and late colonizers of tooth surfaces. the thickness of formed biofilm increased from 14.9+/-5.0 microm after  1 day to 49.3+/-11.6 microm after 7 days. streptococcus spp. were predominant in  1-day-old dental plaque and decreased significantly after 7 days (p=0.0061). compared to the first day, fusobacterium nucleatum decreased after 2 days and increased significantly after 7 days (p=0.0006). the decreases of actinomyces naeslundii content on day 2 and day 7 were significant (p=0.0028). changes in veillonella spp. were not significant during the study period (p >0.05). the results showed that an in vivo observation period of 7 days was required to detect significant changes in streptococcus spp. and f. nucleatum. the multiplex  fish used is suitable for analysing the dynamics of four important bacterial constituents in the oral biofilm in epidemiological studies.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the influence of glucosyltransferase-gene-negative (gtf-) streptococcus mutans strains unable to synthesize water-insoluble or soluble glucan on the structure and macromolecular  diffusion properties of in vitro grown mixed oral biofilms. biofilms modeling supragingival plaque consisted of actinomyces naeslundii omz 745, candida albicans omz 110, fusobacterium nucleatum kp-f2, streptococcus oralis sk 248, veillonella dispar atcc 17748t and one of the s. mutans strains ua159, omz 966, omz 937 or omz 977. biofilms were grown anaerobically on sintered hydroxyapatite  disks for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c. to perform confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses, microorganisms were stained with syto 13 and extracellular polysaccharides (eps) with calcofluor. macromolecular diffusion properties were measured following timed biofilm exposure to texas-red-labeled 70-kda dextran. results showed that replacing wild-type s. mutans by a gtfc- mutant led to an increase in the volume fraction occupied by cells from 29 to 48% and a decrease of the eps volume fraction from 51 to 33%. no such changes were observed when the s. mutans wild-type strain was replaced by a gtfb- or gtfd- mutant. the diffusion coefficient of 70-kda dextran in biofilms containing the gtfc- s. mutans was 16-fold higher than in biofilms with the wild-type strain indicating a strong macromolecular sieving effect of gtf c-generated glucans. our data demonstrate the influence of eps on the structure and macromolecular diffusion properties of  an oral biofilm model and uncover our still limited knowledge of the function of  eps in biofilms and plaque.

TI  == the microbiological origin of fluorescence observed in plaque on dentures during  qlf analysis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbiological origin of plaque fluorescence observed during quantitative light-induced fluorescence (qlf) analysis. plaque was sampled from dentures, because of easy accessibility and the homogeneous background provided by the denture tooth during imaging, and the acknowledged comparability to occlusal plaque. forty removable poly(methyl methacrylate) dentures were screened for the presence of fluorescent plaque deposits during qlf analysis. dentures were photographed, qlf images were recorded and samples of fluorescent plaque were taken. plaque samples were cultured on fastidious anaerobe agar, wilkins chalgren agar and sabourauds dextrose agar. plates were screened under qlf and fluorescent colonies were subcultured and identified. areas of red, orange and green fluorescence were detected on the fitting and non-fitting surfaces of dentures. the red and orange  fluorescing species were prevotella melaninogenica, actinomyces israelii and candida albicans, which are generally acknowledged to be secondary colonisers, present in more mature plaque. green fluorescence was observed in streptococcal species (early colonisers) and fusobacterium nucleatum (important organism in plaque development). non-fluorescent colonies were also cultured. plaque which accumulates on susceptible surfaces tends to be associated with caries, but it may be its maturity, rather than the presence of cariogenic streptococci, that is more likely to provide a microbiological link between red fluorescence and caries.

TI  == pyogenic infections of the central nervous system secondary to dental affections--a report of six cases.
AB  == pyogenic infections of the central nervous system of dental origin are quite uncommon in industrialized countries. we report six cases with intracerebral (n = 4) and intraspinal (n = 2) infections treated in our hospital. the microbial pathogen was successfully isolated in all patients. fusobacterium nucleatum as well as streptococcus species were found in three cases. bacillus species were identified in two patients. actinomyces was the etiologic agent in one case. all  patients suffered from dental pathologies, so that after clinical and radiological exclusion of other sources an oral focus was presumed. therapeutic management consisted of an operative procedure in order to obtain decompression,  as well as evacuation of the pus on the one hand, followed by targeted antibiotics on the other. clinical improvement was achieved in all patients, with one patient lost to follow-up. on magnetic resonance tomography, the inflammatory changes also disappeared in all cases. we recommend that oral infection with recurrent bacteraemia should always be considered in the pathogenesis of the so-called "cryptic" intracerebral and intraspinal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of medicated root canal filling materials.
AB  == bacteria remaining within the root canal system are a significant factor in endodontic failures. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of commercially available gutta-percha formulations against common endodontic pathogens. standard, tetracycline, or iodoform (also called medicated gutta-percha; mgp) containing gutta-percha were tested against actinomyces israelii, a. naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum using the agar diffusion method. resilon points and tetracycline disks/e-tests were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. resilon  did not display antimicrobial properties. standard gutta-percha and mgp inhibited f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii, with mgp also inhibiting a. israelii. tetracycline containing gutta-percha was found to inhibit growth from all four bacterial species tested. the results of this study suggest that the use of tetracycline containing gutta-percha as an obturation material may be useful as a complement to the cleaning and disinfection phase of root canal procedures.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  == analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. we hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum  is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. by contrast, streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. f. nucleatum and s. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. coincubation of kb or tert-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of  f. nucleatum and s. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of  adherent and internalized streptococci. f. nucleatum also promoted invasion of kb cells by other oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii. dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of s. cristatus to adherent and invading f. nucleatum. inhibition of f. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased s. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. in addition, polyclonal antibodies to f. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both kb cells and s. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin d, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. these studies indicate that f. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin.
AB  == purpose: to analyse the microbial flora in specific sites in 20 dentate (> or = 16 teeth) subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin and  in 20 controls matched according to age, sex and number of teeth. materials and methods: the microbial samples were analysed for the following micro-organisms: mutans streptococci, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp., associated with the development of caries, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, associated with plaque accumulation and gingivitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis, frequently found in elevated numbers in periodontitis sites and candida albicans, staphylococcus aureus, enterics and enterococci, associated with mucosal infections. the total microbial count was also registered, together with the total number of streptococci, associated with good oral health. results: in the hyposalivation group, the mean age was 54 +/- 8 years and the mean number of teeth 25 +/- 3. the unstimulated secretion rate was 0.04 +/- 0.04 ml/min and the  stimulated secretion rate 0.98 +/- 0.51 ml/min. compared with the controls, the hyposalivation group tended to harbour a lower number and proportion of f. nucleatum on the tongue, and an increased number of enterococci in the vestibular region. in the supragingival plaque, the numbers of strepococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. were significantly increased and the number of c. albicans tended to be increased. conclusion: the results indicate that subjects with hyposalivation due to medicines or of unknown origin have a supragingival plaque  associated with the development of caries.

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == identification of cultivable microorganisms from primary endodontic infections with exposed and unexposed pulp space.
AB  == this study was aimed at comparing the cultivable microorganisms in canals with periapical radiolucencies with exposed and unexposed pulp space. microbiological  samples were taken and analyzed from 45 canals with exposed pulp space, and 43 canals with unexposed pulp space. the canal contents were analyzed by aerobic/anaerobic culture, and conventional identification techniques. there were 211 isolates of bacteria belonging to 28 genera and 55 species recovered from exposed canals. in the unexposed group, 185 isolates of bacteria were recovered,  of which 54 species of 28 genera were identified. among the four most common genera, prevotella was significantly more common in the exposed group (51/211 in  the exposed group versus 30/185 in the unexposed group) (p = 0.049), while there  were no differences in prevalence of actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, and campylobacter between two groups of canals. in addition, fusobacterium nucleatum  and propionibacterium acne were significantly more common in the unexposed canals (p = 0.047 and p = 0.0051, respectively). similarity in bacterial species in these two groups suggests that pulp space exposure may not be a significant factor in determining the type of bacteria present in infected canals.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  == background/aims: the habit of chewing khat (catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in yemen and east africa, and has expanded to western countries. the purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. methods: a total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. results: streptococcus intermedius and veillonella parvula were  significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of v. parvula and eikenella corrodens. similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. however, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. no significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. there was a significantly lower prevalence of capnocytophaga gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides,  and higher levels of v. parvula and actinomyces israelii. conclusion: the data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.

TI  == dna-dna hybridization demonstrates multiple bacteria in osteoradionecrosis.
AB  == bone necrosis secondary to radiation was previously attributed to trauma of devitalized bone and microbiological sepsis. however, conventional microbiological technique has failed to demonstrate microorganisms throughout osteoradionecrotic bone, claimed to be hypoxic, hypovascular and hypocellular. the aim of the present study was to examine such bone for bacteria using dna-dna  hybridization. compared to standard culture methods this technique enables the investigation of a vast number of bacteria in a fairly short time. twelve deep medullary specimens from resected radionecrotic mandibles were studied. a multitude of bacterial species were detected, most of them anaerobic. porphyromonas gingivalis was the most predominant organism, followed by fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies polymorphum. all samples contained actinomyces, prevotella and f. nucleatum. the results of this study indicate that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, may play a more fundamental role in the pathophysiology of osteoradionecrosis than being merely surface contaminants.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == coaggregation profiles of the microflora from root surface caries lesions.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == [an unusual case of hepatic abscess].
AB  == right upper quadrant pain with chronic malaise and fever can be the clinical manifestation of a hepatic infection. an uncommon cause for the disease is hepatic actinomycosis. actinomycosis was common in the preantibiotic era but is less frequent nowadays; consequently its timely recognition has become more difficult. the clinical and radiological findings often resemble other inflammatory and neoplastic lesions. we report a case of a mixed anaerobic liver  abscess including fusobacteria and actinomycetes, without apparent predisposing factor. the diagnosis was obtained by ct-guided percutaneous aspiration of the hepatic mass, where microscopy revealed the presence of fusiform gramnegative bacteria and gram-positive branching filamentous rods consistent with actinomyces species. the latter did not grow in culture, while the gram negatives were identified as fusobacterium nucleatum. the diagnosis of actinomycosis of the liver is confirmed in only a minority of cases by culture. the disease is usually treated with an extended course of antibiotics. penicillin is the preferred choice.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == development of a multispecies oral bacterial community in a saliva-conditioned flow cell.
AB  == microbial communities within the human oral cavity are dynamic associations of more than 500 bacterial species that form biofilms on the soft and hard tissues of the mouth. understanding the development and spatial organization of oral biofilms has been facilitated by the use of in vitro models. we used a saliva-conditioned flow cell, with saliva as the sole nutritional source, as a model to examine the development of multispecies biofilm communities from an inoculum containing the coaggregation partners streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella atypica, and fusobacterium nucleatum. biofilms inoculated with individual species in a sequential order were compared with biofilms inoculated with coaggregates of the four species. our results indicated that flow cells inoculated sequentially produced biofilms with larger biovolumes compared to those biofilms inoculated with coaggregates. individual-species biovolumes within the four-species communities also differed between the two modes of inoculation. fluorescence in situ hybridization with genus- and species-specific probes revealed that the majority of cells in both sequentially and coaggregate-inoculated biofilms were s. gordonii, regardless of  the inoculation order. however, the representation of a. naeslundii and v. atypica was significantly higher in biofilms inoculated with coaggregates compared to sequentially inoculated biofilms. thus, these results indicate that the development of multispecies biofilm communities is influenced by coaggregations preformed in planktonic phase. coaggregating bacteria such as certain streptococci are especially adapted to primary colonization of saliva-conditioned surfaces independent of the mode of inoculation and order of addition in the multispecies inoculum. preformed coaggregations favor other bacterial strains and may facilitate symbiotic relationships.

AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == selection for high-level resistance by chronic triclosan exposure is not universal.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == gingival crevice microbiota from chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  == the objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (nug). subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in eastern china. samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. the analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (fusobacterium nucleatum/fusobacterium periodonticum, leptotrichia buccalis, tannerella forsythensis, and capnocytophaga sp.), campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces gerencseriae were much more  prevalent in the nug group. quantitatively, most taxa, including p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. only p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p. gingivalis, s. sputigena, a. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the nug group. the present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in nug-associated plaque are of  prime importance.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

TI  == multiplex fish analysis of a six-species bacterial biofilm.
AB  == established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. biofilms composed of the six oral species actinomyces naeslundii, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus  oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, and veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. after fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by fish with 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes ana103 (for the detection of a. naeslundii), euk116 (c. albicans), fus664 (f. nucleatum), mit447 and mit588 (s. oralis), sob174 (s. sobrinus), and vei217 (v. dispar). probes were used as 6-fam, cy3 or cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. results show that the simultaneous investigation by fish of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential gram-staining properties is possible. in combination with the optical sectioning properties of clsm the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == expression of mhc class ii, cd70, cd80, cd86 and pro-inflammatory cytokines is differentially regulated in oral epithelial cells following bacterial challenge.
AB  == oral epithelium may play a regulatory role in local immune responses when interacting with bacteria. the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of selected bacterial pathogens found in periodontal and endodontic infections on oral epithelial cells. expression of cell surface molecules (major  histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii, cd54, cd70, cd80 and cd86) and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha) in response to selected bacterial challenge were examined on an immortalized oral epithelial cell line, hok-18a and a skin epithelial cell line, hacat. actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum lipopolysaccharide (lps) or primary human periradicular exudate from a granuloma were co-cultured with epithelial cells for 4 or 24 h. subsequently, cell surface expression of mhc class ii, cd54, cd70, cd80 and cd86, along with pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were determined using flow cytometry, elisa and rt-pcr. results indicated that the selected oral bacteria have greater  effects on oral versus skin epithelial cells. f. nucleatum increased mhc class ii and cd54 (icam-1) cell surface expression on hok-18a and hacat cells. a. israelii also had enhancing effects on the expression of cd54 and mhc class ii. a. israelii and lps induced a 2.8-fold (p < 0.001) and 4.4-fold (p < 0.005) tnf-alpha secretion, respectively, while f. nucleatum and lps induced a 10-fold (p < 0.0004) and 6-fold (p < 0.01) il-1beta secretion, respectively by hok-18a. interestingly, cd70, cd80, and cd86 were generally decreased upon bacteria and lps challenge on hok-18a. the effects of increased mhc class ii and decreased cd70 were also evident with challenge of human periradicular exudate on hok-18a.  the implications of the study are unique in that oral epithelial cells may play both activating and inhibitory roles in the host immune response towards infection by oral bacteria. we introduce a concept of 'dormancy' where the differential expression of key cell surface antigens on oral epithelial cells may keep the recruited immune effector cells in a state of unresponsiveness, thus contributing to the long term quiescent period observed in many periodontal and endodontic lesions.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  == oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate-containing mouthwash (chxm) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. the microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). chxm caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe  and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (p < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. the degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. dgge showed that chxm exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in prevotella sp. and selenomonas infelix. pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to chx, while lactobacillus rhamnosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. determination of the mics of triclosan, chx, erythromycin, penicillin v, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of chxm exposure, showed that chxm exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to chx (p < 0.05). changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. in conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to chxm represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in view of its localization, brain abscess (ba) usually requires medical and surgical care. a broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. a retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented ba  admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. ba due to anaerobic bacteria (group a) were compared with other cases (group b) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of ba with isolated anaerobic bacteria. between 1991 and 2000, ba were diagnosed in 42 patients (28m, 14f, mean age 54.6  y). no differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with ba caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with ba. anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients  (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. the most frequently isolated species were fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), prevotella sp. (n = 8), actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and bacteroides sp. (n = 4). compared with group b, group a had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and  ear, nose and throat (ent) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). these results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in ba. the presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ent infection, or both. therapy should take into  account this high frequency.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == bacteria-binding plasma proteins in pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite in vitro and on teeth in vivo.
AB  == previous studies on dental pellicle formation and bacterial adherence have focussed on saliva and its components. the tooth surface is, however, also exposed to the plasma-derived crevicular fluid. in the present study, (i). plasma proteins in in vitro and in vivo pellicles were examined using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), immunoblotting and image  analysis and (ii). the adherence of periodontopathogenic bacteria to experimental plasma and saliva pellicles was examined using radio-labelled bacteria and liquid scintillation counting. the plasma components fibrinogen, fibronectin, albumin and igg were incorporated from plasma in the experimental pellicle and mediated the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii. these proteins were also readily detected in in vivo pellicles and were found to a higher extent in pellicles formed at the gingival part of the tooth surface than at the incisal part.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. polyspecies biofilms containing actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, veillonella dispar, and candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined  periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin m increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. the rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. these results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.

AB  == the in vitro activity of faropenem, an oral penem, was compared with those of penicillin, co-amoxiclav, cefoxitin, clindamycin, erythromycin and metronidazole  against 106 isolates of anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections. the  organisms tested comprised porphyromonas gingivalis (29), prevotella spp. (eight), prevotella melaninogenica (seven), prevotella intermedia (five), actinomyces spp. (25), fusobacterium nucleatum (14), peptostreptococcus spp. (11), bacteroides ureolyticus (five) and bacteroides forsythus (two). the antimicrobial properties of faropenem were investigated by studying mics, mbcs, time-kill kinetics and post-antibiotic effect (pae). faropenem was highly active  against all the anaerobes tested (mic(90) < or = 0.5 mg/l) and was bactericidal against both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative anaerobes, with a maximum bactericidal effect at 10 x mic at between 12 and 24 h. in addition, faropenem had an in vitro pae on all the tested isolates and this was not influenced by beta-lactamase production. faropenem may be useful for treating infections caused by periodontal bacteria or oral flora.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == similarity of the oral microbiota of pre-school children with that of their caregivers in a population-based study.
AB  == this study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in saipan were assayed using a dna probe assay. many species including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium  nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. a higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. there were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. by logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. in conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. the microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.

TI  == antibacterial activity of moxifloxacin against periodontal anaerobic pathogens involved in systemic infections.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of penicillin g, amoxycillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, erythromycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 158 isolates associated with periodontal infections. mic(50)/mic(90) values of moxifloxacin were respectively 0.06/0.5 mg/l for porphyromonas gingivalis (35), for prevotella spp. (28) and actinomyces spp. (35), 0.12/0.25 mg/l for fusobacterium nucleatum (20) and 0.06/0.12 mg/l for peptostreptococcus spp. (30). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of moxifloxacin for bacteroides forsythus (6) and campylobacter rectus (4) was 0.06-0.12 mg/l. the minimum bactericidal concentrations were equal to or 2-4 times the mic values. moxifloxacin produced a bactericidal effect at 8 h. our results show that moxifloxacin has good antibacterial activity against periodontal pathogens comparable with that of cefoxitin and amoxycillin/clavulanate, and better than that of clindamycin, metronidazole and penicillin.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == direct amplification of rrna gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. methodology: samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a pcr-based identification assay. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. no pus sample yielded actinomyces israelii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. in general, b. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), s. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), f. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and a. israelii in 5% (two of 40). a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). there was  no correlation between the species and symptoms. conclusions: direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. there was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses.
AB  == despite the high incidence of odontogenic abscesses in pet rabbits, published data on the bacteriology of these infections are lacking, and clinical cultures are often ambiguous, making antibiotic choices difficult. in order to define the  bacteriology of these infections, 12 rabbit mandibular and maxillary abscesses were cultured aerobically and anaerobically. all specimens yielded pathogenic bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella heparinolytica, prevotella spp., peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus milleri group, actinomyces israelii, and arcanobacterium haemolyticum. these organisms are consistent with the characterized bacteriology of periodontal disease in human and other mammalian studies. the isolates were tested against 10 antimicrobial agents commonly used to treat rabbits; 100% of the strains tested were susceptible to clindamycin, 96% were susceptible to penicillin and ceftriaxone, 54% were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, and only 7% were susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

TI  == validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. we describe a model of supragingival plaque containing actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. after 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. this biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of  prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.

AB  == the spatial arrangements and associative behavior of actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. the volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. the microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. all five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. this observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. while the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == establishment of oral anaerobes during the first year of life.
AB  == anaerobic species constitute a significant part of the bacterial community of the mouth. although the time and species involved in the primary colonization of infants are of great importance by forming the basis for further colonization, the development of the oral anaerobic microflora with age is still inadequately understood. in the present study, time and succession of colonization of oral anaerobes were longitudinally examined in 44 healthy caucasian infants at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. unstimulated saliva samples were quantitatively cultured on non-selective brucella blood agar and several selective media for the isolation of anaerobic micro-organisms. the most frequent anaerobic finding in two-month-old infants was veillonella spp. the prevotella melaninogenica group also represented early colonizing species, and the frequency increased remarkably during the first year of life, whereas the prevotella intermedia group organisms  seemed to be late colonizers. fusobacterium nucleatum, non-pigmented prevotella spp., and porphyromonas catoniae were occasional findings in subjects at 2 months but frequent findings in those at one year of age. f. nucleatum was the most frequent strictly anaerobic species in one-year-old infants; other fusobacteria were also occasionally found. the frequency of facultative/micro-aerophilic corroding rods and capnocytophaga spp. started to increase toward the end of the  first year. except for the common presence of facultative/micro-aerophilic actinomyces spp., other anaerobic gram-positive species were only occasionally present in these infants. once established, early-colonizing species tended to persist in the mouth. our longitudinal study demonstrated the establishment of several anaerobic species with steadily increasing frequencies during the first year of life.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == dominant cross-reactive antibodies generated during the response to a variety of  oral bacterial species detect phosphorylcholine.
AB  == the intraperitoneal immunization of balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus mitis, or streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable igm monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. this study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. the concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. labeled bacteria  belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces georgiae, actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. in contrast, actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. these data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == preparation and characterization of an actinomyces naeslundii aggregation factor  that mediates coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == intergeneric coaggregation is responsible for the complexity of the microbiota in human dental plaque and is believed to be important in the initial bacterial colonization of the human oral cavity. actinomyces naeslundii, an early colonizer of the tooth surface, may enhance subsequent colonization by porphyromonas gingivalis which is associated with adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the a. naeslundii aggregation factor (anaf) that mediates coaggregation with p. gingivalis. anaf was isolated from a. naeslundii sonic extract (se) by gel filtration on a sephacryl s-400hr, by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on a hitrap octyl sepharose 4ff, and by ion exchange chromatography on a hitrap q. the specific activity increased 12-fold with a yield of 2.5%. sds-page analysis of anaf revealed a protein band of high molecular weight in excess of 200 kda. carbohydrate was detected as the only material coinciding with the protein band, indicating that the anaf was a glycoprotein. immunoblotting analysis indicated that anaf directly bound to p. gingivalis cells. anaf was sensitive to sodium metaperiodate treatment but not to heat or protease treatments. these results suggest that the anaf carbohydrate component mediated coaggregation with p. gingivalis cells. anaf also inhibited coaggregation with other periodontal disease-associated bacteria such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, but not  streptococci.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of  f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody  5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f.  nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == characteristics of systemic antibody responses of nonhuman primates to cell envelope and cell wall antigens from periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the immune response of the primate, macaca fascicularis, to cell envelope (cea) or cell wall (cwa) antigens of several periodontal pathogens was examined to develop a strategy to interfere with ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were parenterally immunized with cea of either porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia or a combination of cea/cwa of campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus. serum samples were taken every 2-4 weeks over a 4-month period, which included a 13-week interval with molar teeth ligated. all of the nonhuman primates in the study exhibited baseline levels of igg, igm and iga antibody to formalinized whole cells of the bacteria. these levels increased  significantly following immunization and were elevated above baseline throughout  the remainder of the experiment. the largest change in antibody responses was seen in iga antibody levels of p. gingivalis and c. rectus (42-fold above baseline), igm antibody to p. intermedia, (41-fold increase) and igg antibody to  f. nucleatum and a. viscosus (32 and 63-fold increases). moreover, the nonhuman primates exhibited differences in isotype response levels to whole microorganisms compared with the cell envelope antigens. these findings demonstrate the capacity of these nonhuman primates to produce an active immune response to microorganisms chronically colonizing the subgingival microbiota. additionally, it appears that  the bacteria may exhibit some unique differences in their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate and may contribute to the ability of the immune  responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == evidence for serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses in macaca fascicularis identified by monoclonal antibodies to human igg subclasses.
AB  == this investigation determined the capacity of murine monoclonal antibodies directed to human immunoglobulin g (igg) subclasses to identify molecules with conserved epitopes in the serum of the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis. we  subsequently utilized this cross-reactivity to document the characteristics of igg subclass antibody responses in m. fascicularis to parenteral immunization with intact oral microorganisms, antigens from oral microorganisms, and finally a defined protein toxin, tetanus toxoid. the igg response in nonhuman primates immunized with tetanus toxoid showed a 40-fold and 110-fold increase after primary and secondary immunizations, respectively. the major igg subclass responses were igg1 and igg3, with little, though significant, responses in the igg4 and igg2 subclasses. seventy-five to 94% of the natural igg antibody in nonhuman primate sera to porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was igg1. igg2 and igg3 predominated to bacteroides fragilis, igg4 to actinomyces viscosus and an equal distribution among the subclasses was noted in response to fusobacterium nucleatum. parenteral immunization of nonhuman primates with intact p. gingivalis elicited primarily igg3 and igg4, while the post-immunization igg response to p. intermedia was largely igg1. nonhuman primates were also parenterally immunized with cell envelope antigens of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, or a combination of cell envelope antigen from c. rectus and f. nucleatum and cell wall antigens of a. viscosus. the greatest igg antibody response seen post-immunization was reactive  with anti-human igg1 for all of these antigens except to c. rectus which bound nonhuman primate antibody reactive with anti-human igg2. it appears that the bacteria and their products exhibit unique differences in their induction of serum igg subclass antibody responses. the characteristics of their immunogenicity as detected by the nonhuman primate may contribute to the ability  of the immune responses to effectively interact with these pathogens.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == disinfection by calcium hydroxide pastes of dentinal tubules infected with two obligate and one facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == bovine dentine cylinders were experimentally infected with actinomyces israelii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, or enterococcus faecalis. the latter is a facultative anaerobic bacteria and the others are obligate anaerobes commonly found in endodontic infections. the infected specimens were exposed to pastes of calcium hydroxide mixed with saline solution or camphorated paramonochlorophenol for periods of 1 h, 1 day, and 1 week. the viability of bacteria after these exposure times was evaluated by specimen incubation in culture medium to compare the effectiveness of the pastes in disinfecting dentinal tubules. the calcium hydroxide/camphorated paramonochlorophenol paste effectively killed bacteria in the tubules after a 1-h period of exposure, except for e. faecalis that required  one day of exposure. in contrast, the calcium hydroxide/saline paste was ineffective against e. faecalis and f. nucleatum even after 1 week of exposure. the results showed that camphorated paramonochlorophenol increased the antibacterial effects of calcium hydroxide.

TI  == plaque ph and microflora of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces.
AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

AB  == infectious diseases caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, mrsa,  and candida albicans are often serious in compromised hosts. we enumerated mrsa and c. albicans on denture surfaces and in saliva samples from 29 adults. staphylococcus species, mrsa, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, mrse, were detected on 17, 3, and 1 of the 29 denture surfaces, respectively. c. albicans were detected on 22 denture surfaces. all saliva samples from patients whose dentures carried staphylococcus species and c. albicans were also found to contain both microorganisms. adherence of isolated 3h labeled cells of mrsa and c. albicans to resin beads and saliva-coated resin beads was examined. cells of both microorganisms adhered in significantly higher  numbers to saliva-coated resin beads than to resin beads. the hydrophobicity of the mrsa isolated from denture surfaces varied from strain to strain; that of c.  albicans strains was moderately high. the zeta potentials of mrsa isolates and of c. albicans isolates determined in kci buffer were significantly low. the potential of the resin beads decreased after treatment with saliva. two out of 5  mrsa strains were found to be inhibited in growth by oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and gram-negative bacterial strains, suggesting that some oral bacterial species play a role in inhibiting the colonization of staphylococcus species. no isolates of c. albicans were inhibited in their growth by any of the  oral bacteria tested. isolates of mrsa and c. albicans coaggregated with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum strains. using denture cleaners every night for 2 weeks did not reduce numbers of staphylococcus species or c. albicans organisms in saliva.

TI  == the effect of chlorhexidine on defined, mixed culture oral biofilms grown in a novel model system.
AB  == in order to develop an improved method to evaluate antimicrobial agents for use in clinical dentistry, a constant-depth film fermenter (cdff) has been used to generate biofilms of fixed depth comprising nine species of bacteria commonly found in dental plaque in health and disease. these bacteria were grown together  initially in a conventional chemostat which was used to inoculate the cdff over an 8 h period. medium was then supplied directly to the cdff and biofilms allowed to develop. the biofilms were then challenged with eight short pulses of two concentrations of chlorhexidine (0.0125 and 0.125% w/v). the lower concentration  had a limited effect on the composition of the biofilms while a differential and  substantial inhibition was obtained with a higher concentration. actinomyces naeslundii was lost from the biofilm, and the viable counts of streptococci, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were inhibited by over three orders of magnitude by 0.125% chlorhexidine, whereas veillonella dispar was only  transiently affected. the findings were consistent with those from clinical studies of dental plaque, suggesting that this model would have a predictive value when evaluating novel antiplaque or antimicrobial inhibitors.

TI  == scba from streptococcus crista cc5a: an atypical member of the lrai gene family.
AB  == a new member of the lrai family of putative adhesin genes was cloned, from streptococcus crista cc5a, and sequenced. the gene, scba appears to be part of an abc transport operon and encodes a putative peptide of 34.7 kda. the protein contains a signal sequence with residues 17 to 21 (l-a-a-c-s) matching the consensus sequence for the prolipoprotein cleavage site of signal peptidase ii. scba is 57 to 93% identical, at the amino acid level, with the five previous sequenced members of the lrai family. surprisingly, scba does not exhibit adhesion properties characteristic of the other lrai proteins. strain cc5a bound  poorly to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606. an scba insertion-duplication mutation that abolished expression (of scba was created. there was no difference in fibrin binding between this mutant and wild-type cc5a. since it is possible that scba could play a role in corncob formation between s. crista and fusobacterium nucleatum, this property was examined. the mutant strain retained the ability to form corncobs. on the basis of the lack of adhesin properties it appears that scba is an atypical member of the lrai family.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

AB  == eighty-nine species of subgingival bacteria, represented by 121 reference strains and 892 patient isolates, including gram-negative, gram-positive, aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic species, were characterized with a panel of fluorogenic, 4-methylumbelliferyl-linked substrate  tests. identifications of all patient isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) of whole-cell proteins relative to reference strains. characteristic profiles of positive fluorogenic reactions differentiated most of the species, including five porphyromonas species, six pigmenting and five nonpigmenting prevotella species, bacteroides forsythus, three capnocytophaga species, six actinomyces species, four propionibacterium species, and eight streptococcus species. two mannoside isomers differentiated actinomyces israelii and actinomyces gerencseriae. in addition to  porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus, and capnocytophaga species, fusobacterium alocis, actinomyces odontolyticus, actinomyces meyeri, and bifidobacterium dentium were all positive for so-called trypsin-like activity. fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter species were nonreactive with the carbohydrate-based substrates tested. fluorogenic substrate tests provided a sensitive and simple method for biochemical characterization that could presumptively identify to species level most subgingival isolates within 4 h. the method was ideal for rapidly obtaining  presumptive identifications of isolates prior to confirming identifications by definitive methods, such as sds-page.

TI  == a microbiological and clinical study of the safety and efficacy of baking-soda dentifrices.
AB  == this article reports the results of a study that examined the clinical and microbiological changes associated with regular use of baking-soda dentifrices. two dentifrice formulations were examined in a 6-month longitudinal study of 101  adult subjects with assessments for plaque, gingival inflammation, and stain at baseline and 3 and 6 months during the active phase of the study, and at 3 months after cessation of product use. one dentifrice contained 52% baking soda and 3% sodium percarbonate (arm & hammer peroxicare) while the other dentifrice contained 65% baking soda (arm & hammer dental care). both dentifrices resulted in statistically significant reductions in dental plaque, gingival inflammation,  and stain at all time periods compared to baseline. dental plaque and buccal soft-tissue samples were obtained for microbiological analysis from a 50-subject  subset. microbiological assays, including bacterial culture, phase-contrast microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy, confirmed the safety of both formulations. beneficial alterations in dental plaque bacteria were noted, including significant reductions in the levels of actinomyces species. the data from this study indicate that dentifrices containing high levels of baking soda are clinically effective and microbiologically safe.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte defensive functions by nicotine.
AB  == to learn more about the effects of smokeless tobacco on the defensive functions of neutrophils, we studied the influence of nicotine on these cells in vitro, looking at their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, and at their ability to produce microbicidal reactive oxygen species (oxygen radicals). exposure of human blood neutrophils to nicotine (0.01% to 0.1%) inhibited their ability to kill actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. although these concentrations of nicotine are high, such concentrations are relevant to phagocytes in the gingival sulcus, because smokeless tobacco contains 0.5% to 3.5% nicotine by dry weight. nicotine had no such inhibitory effect when the killing assay was performed in an anaerobic environment, implying that nicotine preferentially affected oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms. to further investigate the effects of nicotine on production  of oxygen radicals, neutrophils were primed with lipopolysaccharide and triggered with f-met-leu-phe or phorbol ester in the presence of nicotine. nicotine inhibited production of superoxide anion (measured by reduction of cytochrome c)  and hydrogen peroxide (measured by oxidation of phenol red). nicotine inhibition  of superoxide production was reversible by washing away the nicotine. by observing that nicotine inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by reagent potassium superoxide, we determined that nicotine directly absorbed superoxide. in addition, by examining nicotine inhibition of the uptake of oxygen by neutrophils, we determined that nicotine also interfered with the production of oxygen radicals by these cells. nicotine also inhibited production of superoxide  and interleukin-1 beta by monocytes. nicotine did not affect the viability of neutrophils and monocytes, as determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue  dye. inhibition of the aerobic antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes by nicotine may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and this might be one mechanism by which nicotine compromises the oral health of users of tobacco products.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == intergeneric coaggregation of oral treponema spp. with fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among fusobacterium spp.
AB  == a total of 22 strains of treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. none of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. all treponemes, eight treponema denticola strains, eight t. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one t. pectinovorum strain, and one t. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the  fusobacteria tested as partners. the partners consisted of one strain of fusobacterium periodonticum, five f. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of f. nucleatum, and a strain of f. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. in the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees c for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase k treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. only the t. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and d-galactosamine. none were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or l-arginine. intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of f. nucleatum and with f. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by l-arginine. no intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. these data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.

TI  == oral microbiota in subjects with a weak or strong response in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to examine the composition of the oral microbiota in subjects who had previously demonstrated to develop either a weak or strong response to experimental gingivitis. for this study, subjects were selected from a pool of 25 individuals who had participated twice in an experimental gingivitis trial. out of these 25 panellists, 6 subjects were selected who had developed 2x a weak gingival inflammatory response and 7 subjects who had developed 2x a strong gingival inflammatory response. approximately 9 months after the 2nd experimental gingivitis trial, we evaluated  the clinical condition and the prevalence of a panel of selected oral micro-organisms in these subjects. the subjects were clinically examined for the  presence of plaque, bleeding, pocket depth and loss of attachment. for the microbiological evaluation, samples were taken from the mucous membranes, subgingival sites and saliva. samples were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, spirochaetes and motile rods. clinical evaluation showed that most subjects had a relatively healthy periodontal condition. no clinically  significant differences could be detected between the weak and strong responding  groups. the microbial evaluation showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. micros in all subjects in either group. analysis of the microbial data for the weak and strong responding group showed no differences between the groups.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == this study characterizes oral microorganisms believed to have spread from the root canal into the blood stream during and after endodontic therapy of teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis. microbiological samples were taken under  aseptic conditions from the root canal of 26 single-rooted teeth in 26 patients.  in the endodontic treatment of 13 of the patients (group 1), the first 3 reamers, sizes 15, 20 and 25, were used to a level 2 mm beyond the apical foramen. in the  other 13 patients (group 2), the instrumentation ended inside the root canal 1 mm short of the apical foramen. blood samples were taken from the patients during the instrumentation and 10 min after the treatment was completed. anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from all root canals. in 7 patients of group 1, propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and saccharomyces cerevisiae were recovered from the blood. in 4 patients of group 2, p. intermedia, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus sanguis were isolated from the blood. biochemical tests and antibiograms revealed that the isolates from the root canal and blood had identical profiles within the patients, strongly suggesting that the microorganisms isolated from the blood had the root canal as their source.

TI  == quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (mcclay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. bacteria are centrifuged onto  human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. plates  are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. the force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. the bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (actinomyces viscosus t14 v). these forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately  6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == chemostat flow cell system: an in vitro model for the evaluation of antiplaque agents.
AB  == we developed an experimental in vitro model of dental plaque to assess the potential efficacy of antiplaque agents. the model used a chemostat, which provided a continuous source of 5 species of oral bacteria grown in an artificial "saliva-like" medium. this mixture was pumped through six flow cells, each containing two types of surfaces on which plaque formed and was subsequently measured. formation of bacterial plaque on hydroxyapatite surfaces was assessed by measurement of the dna and protein content of the plaque film. the amount of bacterial plaque formed on germanium surfaces was measured by attenuated total reflectance (atr/ft-ir) spectroscopy. plaque viability was also assessed by a fluorescent staining technique. the quantity of plaque formed on both types of surfaces gradually increased with the duration of flow (from 24 to 72 h) through  the cells during a 72-hour experimental period. the flow cells were then pulsed with experimental treatment solutions for 30 s, twice daily. parallel to results  of human clinical studies, the model was capable of discriminating among water, a placebo mouthrinse, and an active antimicrobial mouthrinse formulation containing 0.03% triclosan. it therefore offers a valuable alternative to animal model testing and allows for more rapid evaluations under well-controlled experimental  conditions.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

TI  == correlation between thermal sensitivity and microorganisms isolated from deep carious dentin.
AB  == the correlation between thermal sensitivity and the microorganisms present in 29  deep carious lesions was studied. the numbers of lactobacilli and total gram-positive rods in the carious lesions were found to be negatively related to  the length of pain triggered by cold and heat stimulants. the presence of gram-positive cocci and non-black-pigmented bacteroides were positively associated with both cold and heat sensitivities. black-pigmented bacteroides, streptococcus mutans, and total anaerobic colony counts were positively related to the heat sensitivity. recovery of fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces viscosus, and enterics on the selective plates was associated with cold sensitivity. total counts of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods on the anaerobic nonselective medium were positively related to the cold sensitivity. it appeared that teeth with low numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded to thermal tests with longer duration of pain. conversely, teeth with high numbers of lactobacilli in the carious lesions usually responded  with shorter duration of pain.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == role of porphyromonas gingivalis 40-kda outer membrane protein in the aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis, an important pathogen in periodontitis, produces extracellular vesicles that aggregate with actinomyces viscosus cells. a 40-kda outer membrane protein (omp)-coding gene from p. gingivalis was cloned and the protein was found to be localized in these vesicles. the recombinant 40-kda omp did not show aggregation activity. however, affinity-purified antibody against the recombinant protein significantly inhibited aggregation of p. gingivalis vesicles with a. viscosus cells. the antibody also inhibited cellular coaggregation of several strains of p. gingivalis with a. viscosus cells, but not with other periodontal pathogens. moreover, aggregation of a. viscosus cells with p. gingivalis vesicles was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by pre-treatment  of the a. viscosus cells with the recombinant protein. these findings suggest that the 40-kda omp may be an important aggregation factor of p. gingivalis.

TI  == immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, and fusobacterium.
AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

AB  == numerous species of bacteria have been implicated with infections of endodontic origin. the purpose of this study was to compare the levels of serum igg antibodies reactive with a panel of 10 oral anaerobic microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. serum samples were collected from 4 patient groups that included healthy patients without endodontic or periodontal disease,  patients with chronic adult periodontal disease, patients with endodontic disease and patients with combined endodontic-periodontal disease. when prevotella intermedia was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant  pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and each of the other 3 groups. in addition, there was a significant difference between the periodontal disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. when porphyromonas gingivalis was allowed to react with sera from the 4 patient groups, significant pairwise differences were shown between the healthy group and the periodontal disease group, the healthy group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group, the endodontic disease group and the periodontal disease group and the endodontic disease group and the combined endodontic-periodontal disease group. the results of this investigation support other studies that associate p. intermedia with both endodontic disease and chronic adult periodontal disease. the results also support studies that implicate p. gingivalis as a periodontopathogen.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == role of cryptic receptors (cryptitopes) in bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces.
AB  == progress in characterizing the receptors that promote bacterial attachment to teeth and oral epithelial cells has suggested that hidden molecular segments may  frequently be involved. such cryptic receptors, referred to as 'cryptitopes', may become exposed by several mechanisms. hidden segments of salivary acidic proline-rich proteins evidently become exposed when the molecules undergo a conformational change as they adsorb to apatitic mineral. adhesins of actinomyces viscosus and certain other prominent dental plaque bacteria are able to bind to these cryptitopes, and this enables these organisms to bind to proline-rich proteins on apatitic surfaces while avoiding interactions with these proteins in  solution. cryptitopes may also become exposed as a result of enzymatic action. thus, several bacteria, including fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii and bacteroides intermedius, have adhesins that bind to galactosyl receptors which become exposed after treatment with neuraminidase.  similarly, the adhesion of some gram-negative bacteria, such as bact. gingivalis, is enhanced when tissue surfaces are treated with certain proteases, or lysosomal enzymes derived from human polymorphonuclear leucocytes. it seems likely that elevated levels of enzymes present in gingival fluid as sequelae of poor oral hygiene and gingivitis may generate cryptitopes for potentially periodontopathic  bacteria, and thereby contribute to modulation of the gingival flora.

AB  == the effect of heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria on the production of interleukin-1 (il-1) and an il-1 inhibitor by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn's) was examined. peripheral blood was obtained from 18 healthy volunteers and the pmn's were separated using dextran sedimentation and ficoll-paque density gradient centrifugation. the pmn's (5 x 10(5) cells/well) were cultured in serum-free media with or without heat-killed periodontopathic bacteria. four gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria were used; bacteroides gingivalis fdc 381, bacteroides forsythus fdc 338, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 and fusobacterium nucleatum fdc 263. the non-oral fusobacterium mortiferum atcc 25557 was used as a control organism. il-1 activity was assayed using thymocyte proliferation. the non-oral organism f. mortiferum stimulated il-1 production by  pmn's, in contrast none of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated il-1 release  although the bacteria themselves had an il-1 enhancing effect. following fractionation of the periodontopathic bacteria stimulated pmn supernatants, an il-1 inhibitory fraction was identified. these results may illustrate a further mechanism by which periodontopathic bacteria may evade the protective effect of pmn's and may also suggest a regulatory role for pmn's in chronic inflammatory periodontal disease.

TI  == coaggregation of fusobacterium nucleatum, selenomonas flueggei, selenomonas infelix, selenomonas noxia, and selenomonas sputigena with strains from 11 genera of oral bacteria.
AB  == twenty-eight strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 selenomonas strains, including s. sputigena (24 strains), s. flueggei (10 strains), s. infelix (5 strains), and s. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate  with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing actinobacillus, actinomyces, bacteroides, capnocytophaga, gemella, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, propionibacterium, rothia, streptococcus, and  veillonella species. selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with actinomyces naeslundii pk984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. in contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. each fusobacterium  strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by edta, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. heating the fusobacteria at 85  degrees c for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of  fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective.  the strains of f. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. the contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.

AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. murine peritoneal pmn was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. the pmn response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (cl) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the cl response were also measured. the bacteria which could induce a high level of cl response of pmn were fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were staphylococcus subsp. and actinomyces subsp.; low levels were lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of streptococci and enterococcus  faecalis. phagocytic indexes of pmn to various kind of bacteria were distributed  from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 pmn were 27 to 301. there was no correlation between cl values and phagocytic indexes or between cl values and the bacterial number in 100 pmn by limiting the data on staphylococcus, streptococcus subsp. and lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. there was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from pmn by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of pmn. either catalase activities or sod activities were measured by h2o2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of cl response.

TI  == influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  == to study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides gingivalis. on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. the rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. none of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. in general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. these results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.

TI  == [microbiological and serological investigation of periodontal disease activity].
AB  == if disease activity in periodontal disease can be determined, the therapeutic measures of periodontitis may become diverse and different from patient to patient. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of microbiological and serological examination of periodontopathic bacteria in detecting destructive periodontal disease activity. one hundred and forty-eight sites in 52 subjects with moderate to severe periodontitis were studied clinically. clinical parameters included plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, bleeding on probing and percent bone loss as measured radiographically. subgingival plaque of whole sites was investigated microbiologically by means of  indirect fluorescent-antibody technique with rabbit antibodies against actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2 serotypes), eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius. the levels of serum igg antibody to these organisms were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with whole cell preparations. thirty-two of 52 subjects were instructed in oral hygiene and received several sessions of scaling and root planing. the clinical, bacteriological and serological assessments were also performed after periodontal therapy. active disease site was defined as the site of which clinical status did not be improved even after periodontal treatment. b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. viscosus were detected in 80% of periodontal lesions, and the proportion of b. gingivalis  was the highest among six bacterial species tested. a. actinomycetemcomitans, e.  corrodens and f. nucleatum were found only occasionally and in low numbers. the proportion of b. gingivalis was higher in severely inflamed sites than in clinically healthy sites. b. gingivalis and b. intermedius are rarely found in treated periodontitis sites, while the proportion of a. viscosus was slightly increased after treatment. sera of the pre-treatment patients demonstrated significantly higher antibody levels to b. gingivalis and significantly lower levels to a. viscosus than those of healthy persons. antibody levels reactive with other four species in the patients did not significantly differ from the levels in healthy persons. after periodontal therapy, antibody levels to b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a) significantly decreased and the levels to a. viscosus increased to a slight degree. b. gingivalis was found more frequently in disease-active sites than in disease-inactive sites. the proportions of other bacterial species in disease-active sites did not differ from those in disease-inactive sites. the results of the present investigation suggest that monitoring b. gingivalis in subgingival plaque and serum igg antibody titer against this organism may aid in  the description and adequate treatment of the periodontal disease.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

AB  == juvenile diabetics have been shown to have an increased susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontitis following puberty. however, little data are available on changes in the microbial flora that occur at the onset of puberty. this study was performed to determine if antibacterial antibody titers to selected periodontal disease-associated microorganisms might be helpful in revealing changes in plaque flora at the onset and conclusion of puberty. sera was obtained from 35 subjects (ages 7 to 18 years) selected from a population of  insulin-dependent diabetics. the subjects were given a thorough medical examination which included an assessment of sexual maturation and a dental examination which included the recording of onset and magnitude of bleeding according to the papillary bleeding score. antibody titers to a. naeslundii (an), b. intermedius (bi), b. gingivalis (bg), f. nucleatum (fn), a. actinomycetemcomitans (aa), c. ochracea (co) and t. denticola (td) were determined using the microelisa. stratification of antibody titers by age groups  (less than or equal to 12 years, 12 to 15 years, greater than 15 years) revealed  that titers to an increased significantly (p less than 0.025, anova) and progressively (p less than 0.05, regression analysis) with increasing age. in contrast, the titers to fn were maximal in the under 12 year group and decreased  with age (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.05). there  were no significant variations in titers observed for the other microorganisms. stratification by sexual maturity revealed a similar progressive decrease of the  titer to fn (anova, p less than 0.05; regression analysis, p less than 0.005).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [bacterial invasion in periodontitis, is it important in periodontal treatment?].
AB  == during the progression of periodontal disease bacteria invade the epithelial lining of the gingival pocket and the underlying connective tissue. this invasion was demonstrated in acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (anug), localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), rapidly progressive periodontitis in adults (rpp) and in children with papillon-lefevre syndrome associated periodontitis. using morphologic criteria or fluorescent antibody staining techniques spirochetes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, b. intermedius, actinomyces species, fusobacterium nucleatum and mycoplasma have been identified  in these tissue compartments. recent light microscopic, electron microscopic and  bacteriological studies demonstrated the presence of invading bacteria in the cementum and in the radicular dentin of teeth with periodontal disease. in 83% of 69 carries free periodontally diseased teeth bacteria were present in one of the  dentin layer from the root. in 59% of these teeth the dental pulps contained bacteria. the composition of the flora resembled that of the subgingival flora. the use of chlorhexidine, fluoride, tetracyclines or metronidazole in the elimination of invading bacteria following mechanical periodontal therapy is discussed.

TI  == [inducing effect of periodontopathic bacteria on activation of macrophage functions and production of interleukin-1 by mouse peritoneal macrophages].
AB  == periodontal disease is thought to be initiated by a bacterial infection and subsequently developed by immunopathological mechanisms thorough host-parasite interactions. the macrophage and lymphocyte are the major functional cell types in the lesion of the disease and participate in tissue destruction and alteration of the periodontal connective tissue as well as in host defense mechanisms. however, the detailed implications of macrophages in development of the disease is still unclear. the aim of this study was to gain more understanding of the functional role of macrophages in periodontal disease. in this study, we examined the inducing effects of sonicated extracts from some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria associated with the pathogenesis of periodontal disease, including bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans, and actinomyces viscosus, on activation of macrophage functions and il-1 production by the macrophages from the mouse peritoneum. at a  dose as low as 1 microgram/ml (dry weight) sonicated extracts from b. gingivalis  induced an increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. a significant increase in the acid phosphatase and in glucose consumption was observed in the cultures at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the addition of the sonicate. sonicated extracts from a. viscosus, a gram-positive bacterium, as well as b. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and h. actinomycetemcomitans, gram-negative ones, were able to induce the increase in acid phosphatase activity and in glucose consumption of the macrophages. these periodontopathic bacteria were found to strongly induce il-1 production by the macrophages as early as 24 h after addition of the sonicates. a significant increase in the il-1 production was observed at a dose of 1 microgram/ml of the sonicates. the inducing ability was equivalent to 1 microgram/ml escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the highest production of il-1  was observed in the macrophages treated with h. actinomycetemcomitans among these sonicates. sonicated extracts from both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria  were able to induce the il-1 production by macrophages from c3h/hej mice, which are lps low-responders. these results suggest that periodontopathic bacteria have potent ability to induce macrophage activation and il-1 production and that the activated macrophages may play an important role in development of periodontal disease.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular  constituents of this matrix. radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from pf hr-9 cells. bacteroides gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum fn-2, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ga3(a) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of a. actinomycetemcomitans ga3(na) and suny  ab67 (range, 20 to 25%). the attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. the adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated  matrix proteins. the results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as b. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. on the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. the results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.

AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

TI  == structural determinants of activity of chlorhexidine and alkyl bisbiguanides against the human oral flora.
AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == direct modulation of human neutrophil adherence by coaggregating periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == direct interaction between fusobacterium nucleatum and pmns produced consistent enhancement of pmn adherence. in contrast, consistent suppression of pmn adherence was observed after direct interactions between pmns and bacteroides gingivalis or actinomyces viscosus. the modulatory effects of these periodontopathic bacteria on pmn function could be seen as early as 2 min after interaction. the effects were abrogated by alterations of bacterial structural integrity with heat, formalin or ultrasonic disruption. carbohydrate or glycoprotein receptors on pmns may be involved because the effects were blocked by monosaccharides in the medium. coaggregation experiments showed that permutations involving f. nucleatum always resulted in enhancement of pmn adherence, and that this can be blocked by d-galactose. these findings may have implications in the initiation and sustenance of chronic inflammatory tissue damage in periodontitis.

AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

AB  == we screened 36 strains of streptococcus sanguis biotype i and 8 strains of s. sanguis biotype ii for the presence of surface structures and for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum. negative staining under an electron microscope revealed  detectable surface structures on all s. sanguis strains. the majority of strains  (38 of 44) carried peritrichous fibrils, which have an irregular profile and no distinct width. they usually appeared as a fringe with a constant width around the cell. strains selected for measurement had a fringe with an average length of 72.4 +/- 8.5 nm on biotype i strains and 51.6 +/- 3.3 nm on biotype ii strains. some fibrillar biotype i strains carried an additional, longer (158.7 +/- 33.1 nm) type of fibril projecting through the shorter fibrils. fibrillar density was  characteristic for each strain, ranging from very dense on all cells in a population to very sparse on a few cells in a population. a small group of six strains carried tufts of fibrils in a lateral or polar position on the cell. either one or two lengths of fibril were present in the tuft depending on the strain. one strain carried both peritrichous fibrils and fimbriae. fimbriae are flexible structures with a constant width (4.5 to 5.0 nm) all along their length  but very variable lengths (less than or equal to 0.7 micron) on each cell. s. sanguis i and ii both included strains with peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils, but the mixed morphotype strain was confined to biotype ii. fibrils were present on cells at all stages throughout the growth cycle for the strains tested. freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with a. viscosus and a. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the  ability. in addition, all tufted strains could not coaggregate, but the strains with the mixed morphotype coaggregated well. coaggregation with f. nucleatum was  very strong for the fibrillar strains, but less strong for the tufted strains. we discuss the possible correlation between s. sanguis surface structure and ability to coaggregate.

TI  == bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in children.
AB  == children are more resistant to gingivitis than are adults. to determine possible  differences in their periodontal floras, an experimental gingivitis study, identical in design to one reported earlier with young adults, was conducted with four 4- to 6-year-old children. the incidence of sites that developed gingival index scores of 2 in children was less than one-third of the incidence observed in adults. the composition of the flora of each child was statistically significantly different from that of any other child or adult. the floras of the  children as a group were statistically significantly different from those of the  adults. children had 3-fold greater proportions of leptotrichia species, 2.5-fold greater proportions of capnocytophaga species, 2.3-fold greater proportions of selenomonas species, 2-fold greater proportions of bacterial species that require formate and fumarate, and 1.5-fold greater proportions of bacteroides species. adults had greater proportions of fusobacterium, eubacterium, and lactobacillus species. fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces wva 963, selenomonas d04, and treponema socranskii were predominant species that correlated with increasing gingival index scores in both children and adults.

TI  == immunologic profile of juvenile periodontitis. i. lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.
AB  == studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (jp) patients have been inconclusive. experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in jp and phytohaemagglutinin (pha) were performed. variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of dna which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (ljp) and generalized (gjp) forms of jp patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (y-4), bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochraceus, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis and treponema denticola. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (amlr) were increased for ljp compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of gjp were decreased compared to healthy subjects and ljp (p less than 0.05). these observations indicate that gjp patients may have abnormalities in t- and b-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.

TI  == nonspecific induction of immunoglobulin m antibodies to periodontal disease-associated microorganisms after polyclonal human b-lymphocyte activation  by fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the production of antibodies to oral bacteria was determined in lymphocyte cultures stimulated with sonicated fusobacterium nucleatum, a potent inducer of polyclonal b-cell activation. after 9 days the cultures were examined by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for immunoglobulin m (igm) antibodies to f. nucleatum, bacteroides gingivalis, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. antibodies to these four bacteria were detected in cultures stimulated with polyclonal b-cell activation-inducing concentrations of f. nucleatum. however, significant concentrations of antibodies to f. nucleatum, but not to the other three microorganisms, were produced in cultures that received suboptimal polyclonal b-cell activation-inducing doses of f. nucleatum. absorption studies indicated the specificity of the antibodies to each of the bacteria tested. igm antibody production induced by f. nucleatum was enhanced by the addition of t cells. the production of igm antibodies to the bacteria was reproducible in cultures from a single person tested on 3 consecutive days. the concentration of  antibodies in replicate cultures, however, fluctuated greatly. to obtain consistent responses on successive days, multiple replicate cultures were required. these results suggest that f. nucleatum, which is frequently present in subgingival plaque, could induce the production of antibodies not only to f. nucleatum, but also to other microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases.

TI  == effect of factors other than pathologic status on responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == studies were designed to assess factors other than pathologic status of the cell  donor which affect the blastogenic responsiveness in vitro of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbms) from normal donors and patients with periodontitis. cultures were established and activated using phytohemagglutinin-p (pha) or homogenates of actinomyces viscosus (avis), a gram-positive plaque microorganism, and fusobacterium nucleatum (fuso), a gram-negative plaque microorganism. activation was assessed by measuring the incorporation of labeled precursor into  dna. the effects of incubation time, vessel shape, cell concentration, prostaglandin e2 and indomethacin on blastogenic responsiveness were studied. blastogenic responsiveness became maximal after 5 to 8 days' activation with the  bacterial substances, and after 3 days' activation with pha. radioactivity incorporated by cultures in microtest wells with flat, round and conical bottoms  was 5.9, 7.8 and 10.6 x 10(3) cpm, respectively. cultures of cells from all of the patients and normal subjects were activated by pha, avis and fuso, and cell concentration was a major determinant of the magnitude of the blastogenic response. responsiveness of cultures from all patients and control subjects activated with avis and fuso was inhibited significantly by prostaglandin e-2 (pge2) at a concentration of 10 microm. inhibition was generally 50% or greater.  indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostaglandin production, at a concentration of 0.5 micrograms/ml significantly enhanced responsiveness of avis- and fuso-activated cultures from control donors and patients, indicating that prostaglandins are produced endogenously, and that they affect cell responsiveness. the effect of pge2 and indomethacin on pha-activated cultures was more variable and, where present, of a lesser magnitude than that observed for cultures activated with bacterial homogenates. in most cultures the effects were not statistically significant. our data show that in studies of lymphocyte activation, the incubation time, culture-vessel shape, cell concentration and presence of endogenous inhibitors need to be taken into account.

TI  == isolation, partial purification and preliminary characterization of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans rm-10.
AB  == an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from  cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees  c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions  of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.

AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == bacteriology of experimental gingivitis in young adult humans.
AB  == from replicate trials of experimental gingivitis in four periodontally healthy subjects, 166 bacterial species and subspecies were detected among 3,034 randomly selected isolates from 96 samples. of these bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii (serotype iii and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), actinomyces odontolyticus (serotype i and phenotypically similar strains that were unreactive with available antisera), fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus species d-2, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella parvula, and treponema species a appeared to be the most likely etiological agents of gingivitis. statistical interpretations indicated that the greatest source of microbiological variation of the total flora observed was person-to-person differences in the floras. the next greatest source of variation was the inflammatory status of the sample sites. person-to-person differences were smallest at experimental day 4. the floras became more diverse with time and as gingivitis developed and progressed. analyses indicated that sequential colonization by certain species was repeatable and therefore probably predictable. variation was relatively small between replicate trials, between two sites on the same teeth sampled on the same day, and between the same sites sampled at the same relative time in a replicate trial.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == [antibiotic treatment of human actinomykoses (author's transl)].
AB  == in the complex aetiology of human actinomykoses, various actinomyces species, especially a. israelii, play the pathogenetically leading role in the mixed flora so typical for these diseases. a number of other microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria are also part of such mixed flora. since these "concomitant" bacteria are themselves potentially pathogenic, it is important to have data on antibiotic sensitivity for the entire spectrum of microorganisms, to achieve effective and economic chemotherapy of human actinomykoses. minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics were determined for actinomyces and the most important concomitant bacteria from actinomykotic processes: actinobacillus actinomycetem-commitants, bacteroides of the melaninogenicus group, b. fragilis, b. theta-iotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium spp. and propionibacteria. the results indicate that aminopenicillines are the drug of first choice, if in the actinomykoses there are no bacteroides strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. these tests further indicate that clinically the combination of aminopenicillin and clindamycin, as well as aminopenicillin and metronidazol, are indicated. minocycline and especially cefoxitin, a beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporin, inhibit with few exceptions all bacteria which are potentially involved in actinomykotic processes.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

AB  == the lymphocyte blastogenic response to a panel of antigens and mitogens was assessed in a group of 20 women throughout their pregnancy. in addition, a group  of five nonpregnant women was monitored simultaneously to identify variations in  response to the same stimulants. the stimulants included orally associated bacterial antigens (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius, bacteroides [capnocytophaga] ochraceus, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and non-orally associated-stimulants (streptokinase-streptodornase, tetanus toxoid, concanavalin a, phytohemagglutinin, and pokeweed mitogen). intrinsic (cells cultured in male ab plasma) suppression of the lymphocyte response to these stimulants was observed to occur by the second trmester of pregnancy and was resolved after parturition. additionally, an extrinsic (cells cultured in autologous plasma) suppression was also suggested to occur in a similar manner. there was no detectable enhancement of the blastogenic response to oral bacteria associated with elevated gingivitis, which is generally reported to occur during nonpregnancy gingivitis. we propose that concomitant immunosuppression occurs during the second trimester, which masks such enhancement.
