TI  - Gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  - Diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. The most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, Salmonella and Campylobacter. Viruses, toxigenic Arcobacter and Bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as Cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. Blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. The use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.
TI  - The beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The structure of exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by Bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. RESULTS: The strain named Bifidobacterium bifidum WBIN03 with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (EPS) yield was selected to study the effect of its EPS on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. The results indicated that EPS significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis indicated that the EPS significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. When receiving a low dose of EPS, Bacteroidales sp./Lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and L. johnsonii, L. animalis and L. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a high concentration of EPS. CONCLUSION: The combination of viable cell count, DGGE and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of EPS from B. bifidum WBIN03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health of their hosts.
TI  - [Traveller's diarrhea: epidemiology, clinical practice guideline for the prevention and treatment].
AB  - Bacterial causes are predominant: enterotoxigenic (ETEC) ou enteroadherent Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Acrobacter sp., enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis. Prevention relies on the hand and food hygiene standards (heat-cooked meals). Watery diarrhea (toxigenic enterocolitis) is the most frequent clinical presentation associated with a risk of dehydration; the body temperature is normal except in cases of severe dehydration. Less frequent are invasive enterocolitis presenting as acute febrile diarrhea with dysentery (abdominal cramps, tenesmus, stools blended with mucus and blood): salmonellosis, shigellosis. Bacteremia may occur in immunocompromised patients. Early rehydration is essential with oral rehydration solutions (ORS) consisting of salt, sugar and water. Antibiotics should be reserved for invasive enterocolitis with fever and dysentery, profuse diarrhea with more than three liquid stools within 12 hours. Duration of antibiotherapy varies from 1 to 5 days.
TI  - [Assessment of susceptibility of strictly anaerobic bacteria originated from different sources to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the past 20 years, several studies at a national level in different countries followed resistance trends for Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium difficile. This study analysed antimicrobial susceptibility 73 anaerobic bacteria strains of Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) and C. difficile to fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial drugs. METHODS: The strictly anaerobes strains isolated in different hospitals were sent to the Department of Medical Microbiology, Medical Uniwersity of Warsaw, where species determination was carried out with the API20 ANA (bioMerieux SA, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) system. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using E-test. RESULTS: The rates of high resistance to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin of BFG was respectively 84% and 31% and among of C. difficile strains respectively 92% and 36%). The percentage of BFG strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were respectively 84% and 46%. The percentage of C. difficile strains resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin was 52%. Reduced level of susceptibility of BFG strains to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8%) was confirmed. Resistance to cefoxitin was 16% of BFG strains. All tested strains as well as BFG and C. difficile were susceptible to metronidazole. Was observed reduced leve (EUCAST) of susceptibility of C. difficile strains to vancomycin (13%). CONCLUSIONS. Increasing resistance to various antimicrobial agents is a significant problem in Poland. This demonstrate the need to continue with antibiotic resistance testing and surveys in anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Differential interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-23 production by human blood monocytes and dendritic cells in response to commensal enteric bacteria.
AB  - Human peripheral blood contains antigen-presenting cells (APC), including dendritic cells (DC) and monocytes, that may encounter microbes that have translocated from the intestine to the periphery in disease states like HIV-1 infection and inflammatory bowel disease. We investigated the response of DC and monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to a panel of representative commensal enteric bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus sp., and Bacteroides fragilis. All three bacteria induced significant upregulation of the maturation and activation markers CD40 and CD83 on myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). However, only mDC produced cytokines, including interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-12p40/70, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in response to bacterial stimulation. Cytokine profiles in whole PBMC differed depending on the stimulating bacterial species: B. fragilis induced production of IL-23, IL-12p70, and IL-10, whereas E. coli and Enterococcus induced an IL-10-predominant response. mDC and monocyte depletion experiments indicated that these cell types differentially produced IL-10 and IL-23 in response to E. coli and B. fragilis. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron did not induce levels of IL-23 similar to those of B. fragilis, suggesting that B. fragilis may have unique proinflammatory properties among Bacteroides species. The addition of recombinant human IL-10 to PBMC cultures stimulated with commensal bacteria abrogated the IL-23 response, whereas blocking IL-10 significantly enhanced IL-23 production, suggesting that IL-10 controls the levels of IL-23 produced. These results indicate that blood mDC and monocytes respond differentially to innate stimulation with whole commensal bacteria and that IL-10 may play a role in controlling the proinflammatory response to translocated microbes.
TI  - Comparative (meta)genomic analysis and ecological profiling of human gut-specific bacteriophage phiB124-14.
AB  - Bacteriophage associated with the human gut microbiome are likely to have an important impact on community structure and function, and provide a wealth of biotechnological opportunities. Despite this, knowledge of the ecology and composition of bacteriophage in the gut bacterial community remains poor, with few well characterized gut-associated phage genomes currently available. Here we describe the identification and in-depth (meta)genomic, proteomic, and ecological analysis of a human gut-specific bacteriophage (designated phiB124-14). In doing so we illuminate a fraction of the biological dark matter extant in this ecosystem and its surrounding eco-genomic landscape, identifying a novel and uncharted bacteriophage gene-space in this community. phiB124-14 infects only a subset of closely related gut-associated Bacteroides fragilis strains, and the circular genome encodes functions previously found to be rare in viral genomes and human gut viral metagenome sequences, including those which potentially confer advantages upon phage and/or host bacteria. Comparative genomic analyses revealed phiB124-14 is most closely related to phiB40-8, the only other publically available Bacteroides sp. phage genome, whilst comparative metagenomic analysis of both phage failed to identify any homologous sequences in 136 non-human gut metagenomic datasets searched, supporting the human gut-specific nature of this phage. Moreover, a potential geographic variation in the carriage of these and related phage was revealed by analysis of their distribution and prevalence within 151 human gut microbiomes and viromes from Europe, America and Japan. Finally, ecological profiling of phiB124-14 and phiB40-8, using both gene-centric alignment-driven phylogenetic analyses, as well as alignment-free gene-independent approaches was undertaken. This not only verified the human gut-specific nature of both phage, but also indicated that these phage populate a distinct and unexplored ecological landscape within the human gut microbiome.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of extracts of Tibouchina candolleana (melastomataceae), isolated compounds and semi-synthetic derivatives against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - This work describes the phytochemical study of the extracts from aerial parts of  Tibouchina candolleana as well as the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of extracts, isolated compounds, and semi-synthetic derivatives of ursolic acid against endodontic bacteria. HRGC analysis of the n-hexane extract of T. candolleana allowed identification of beta-amyrin, alpha-amyrin, and beta-sitosterol as major constituents. The triterpenes ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were isolated from the methylene chloride extract and identified. In addition, the flavonoids luteolin and genistein were isolated from the ethanol extract and identified. The antimicrobial activity was investigated via determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the broth microdilution method. Amongst the isolated compounds, ursolic acid was the most effective against the selected endodontic bacteria. As for the semi-synthetic ursolic acid derivatives, only the methyl ester derivative potentiated the activity against Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Bacteroides fragilis endocarditis: a case report and review of literature.
AB  - Endocarditis due to Bacteroides fragilis is a rare disorder. This article describes a case of Bacteroides fragilis endocarditis associated with portal and superior mesenteric venous thrombosis in a patient without preexisting valvular heart disease and review the cases of endocarditis due to this anaerobic bacterium in medical literature since 1980.
TI  - Properties of BoAGE2, a second N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 2-epimerase from Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483.
AB  - N-Acyl-D-Glucosamine 2-epimerase (AGE) catalyzes the reversible epimerization between N-acetyl-D-mannosamine (ManNAc) and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 shows 3 putative genes for AGE activity (BACOVA_00274, BACOVA_01795 and BACOVA_01816). The BACOVA_00274 gene encodes an AGE (BoAGE1) with strong similarity to the AGE previously characterized in Bacteroides fragilis. Interestingly, the BACOVA_01816 gene (BoAGE2) shares 57% identity with Anabaena sp. CH1 AGE, but has an extra 27-amino acid tag sequence in the N-terminal. When cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)pLys, BACOVA_01816 was able to convert ManNAc into GlcNAc and vice versa. It was stable over a broad range of pHs and its activity was enhanced by ATP (20 muM). The incubation with ATP stabilized its structure, raising its melting temperature by about 8 degrees C. In addition, the catalytic efficiency for ManNAc synthesis was higher than that for GlcNAc synthesis. These characteristics make BoAGE2 a promising biocatalyst for sialic acid production using cheap GlcNAc as starting material. BoAGE2 could be considered a Renin-binding Protein and its interaction with renin was studied for the first time in a prokaryotic AGE. Surprisingly, renin activated BoAGE2, an effect which is contrary to that described for mammalian AGE and unrelated with the unique N-terminal tag, since a mutant without this tag was also activated by renin. When BoAGE2 sequence was compared with other related (real and putative) AGE described in the databases, it was seen that AGE enzymes can be divided in 3 different groups. The relationship between these groups is also discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Quantitative detection of enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis subtypes isolated  from children with and without diarrhea.
AB  - A rapid real-time PCR (RT-PCR) approach was developed to detect the bft gene subtypes in Bacteroides fragilis isolated from fecal samples. DNA obtained from diarrhea (110) and nondiarrhea (150) samples was evaluated. Subtype 1 was observed in 9 (8.2%) diarrhea and 7 (4.7%) nondiarrhea samples. Subtype 2 was not detected in any DNA samples, and subtype 3 was observed in only 1 diarrhea sample. The presence of the bft-1 gene did not show any statistically significant differences between the groups of children. This technique could be used to evaluate a possible correlation between disease and the presence of B. fragilis enterotoxin.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - A family of transcriptional antitermination factors necessary for synthesis of the capsular polysaccharides of Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - A single strain of Bacteroides fragilis synthesizes eight distinct capsular polysaccharides, designated PSA to PSH. These polysaccharides are synthesized by-products encoded by eight separate polysaccharide biosynthesis loci. The genetic architecture of each of these eight loci is similar, including the fact that the first gene of each locus is a paralog of the first gene of each of the other PS loci. These proteins are designated the UpxY family, where x is replaced by a to h, depending upon the polysaccharide locus from which it is produced. Mutational analysis of three separate upxY genes demonstrated that they are necessary and specific for transcription of their respective polysaccharide biosynthesis operon and that they function in trans. Transcriptional reporter constructs, reverse transcriptase PCR, and deletion analysis demonstrated that the UpxYs do not affect initiation of transcription, but rather prevent premature transcriptional termination within the 5' untranslated region between the promoter and the upxY gene. The UpxYs have conserved motifs that are present in NusG and NusG-like proteins. Mutation of two conserved residues within the conserved KOW motif abrogated UpaY activity, further confirming that these proteins belong to the NusG-like (NusG(SP)) family. Alignment of highly similar UpxYs led to the identification of a small region of these proteins predicted to confer specificity for their respective loci. Construction of an upaY-upeY hybrid that produced a protein in which a 17-amino-acid segment of UpaY was changed to that of UpeY altered UpaY's specificity, as it was now able to function in transcriptional antitermination of the PSE biosynthesis operon.
TI  - Species identification of clinical isolates of Bacteroides by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis and related species are important human pathogens involved in mixed infections of different origins. The B. fragilis group isolates are phenotypically very similar, grow more slowly than aerobic bacteria and, accordingly, are frequently misidentifed with classical or automated phenotypical identification methods. Recent taxonomic changes and new species accepted as members of the Bacteroides genus are not included in the different databases of commercially available identification kits. The use of matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was therefore evaluated for the species identification of 277 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides genus. Species identification was carried out with MALDI Bruker Daltonik Biotyper software (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) by comparing the mass spectrum of each strain with the mass spectra of the 3260 reference strains currently available. The results of conventional phenotypical identification of the isolates were used as a reference. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed for a selection of the strains that gave discrepant results and for all those inconclusively identified by MALDI-TOF MS; 270 isolates (97.5%) were unequivocally identified [log(score) >/=2.0] by comparison with the reference strains present in the MALDI Biotyper database. Of the 23 isolates for which the MALDI-TOF MS species identification differed from the conventional phenotypical identification, 11 were sequenced. The sequencing data confirmed the MALDI-TOF MS result in ten cases and, for the remaining isolate, the sequencing data did not lead to the determination of the species, but only to that of the genus (Bacteroides sp.). The discriminating power and identification accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS proved to be superior to that of biochemical testing for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides uniformis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of human defensins on anaerobic intestinal bacterial species: a major role of HBD-3.
AB  - Defensins are natural mucosal antimicrobial peptides and their broad spectrum activity against aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria has been well investigated. The aim of this study was to systematically examine the antibacterial activity of the small intestinal Paneth cell derived alpha-defensin HD5 and the major colonic beta-defensins HBD-1-3 against strict anaerobic intestinal bacteria. The antibacterial activity was assessed with a flow cytometric assay employing a membrane potential sensitive dye as marker for loss of cell viability. The majority of the tested strains belonging to the dominant anaerobe genera of the gut, Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, were only minimally affected by the constitutively expressed defensins HD5 and HBD-1. The inducible defensin HBD-2 had a limited antibacterial effect, whereas the inducible HBD-3 exhibited potent activity against most strains. The effect of HBD-3 on Bacteroides sp. appeared to be dependent on the presence of oxygen. Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from blood during bacteremia or from extraintestinal infections were more resistant to HBD-3 than strains from the physiological gut flora. Thus, defensin resistance is not only species- but also strain-specific and may be clinically relevant in the host-bacteria interaction influencing mucosal translocation and systemic infection.
TI  - Multidrug resistance gene deficient (mdr1a-/-) mice have an altered caecal microbiota that precedes the onset of intestinal inflammation.
AB  - AIM: To compare caecal microbiota from mdr1a(-/-) and wild type (FVB) mice to identify differences in the bacterial community that could influence the intestinal inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice were evaluated at 12 and 25 weeks of age using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative real-time PCR. DGGE fingerprints of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (with no intestinal inflammation) at 12 weeks revealed differences in the presence of DNA fragments identified as Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus and an uncultured alphaproteobacterium. Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter sp. were only identified in DGGE profiles of mdr1a(-/-) mice at 25 weeks (with severe intestinal inflammation), which also had a lower number of total bacteria in the caecum compared with FVB mice at same age. CONCLUSIONS: Differences found in the caecal microbiota of FVB and mdr1a(-/-) mice (12 weeks) suggest that the lack of Abcb1 transporters in intestinal cells due to the disruption of the mdr1a gene might lead to changes in the caecal microbiota. The altered microbiota along with the genetic defect could contribute to the development of intestinal inflammation in mdr1a(-/-) mice. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Differences in caecal microbiota of mdr1a(-/-) and FVB mice (12 weeks) suggest genotype specific colonization. The results provide evidence that Abcb1 transporters may regulate host interactions with commensal bacteria. Future work is needed to identify the mechanisms involved in this possible cross-talk between the host intestinal cells and microbiota.
TI  - [Abscess of the posterior cranial fossa. Report of 4 cases].
AB  - The posterior cerebral fossa is an uncommon location for cerebral abscess. In most cases diagnosis is made at the encapsulation stage with the risk of life-threatening tonsillar herniation. The purpose of this retrospective study was to describe our experience in the management of four cases of abscess located in the posterior cerebral fossa between January 2000 and December 2004. All patients benefited from clinical examination and radiological study (CT-scan). Surgical treatment performed in all cases consisted of trepano-puncture of the abscess. The minimum duration of post-operative follow-up was 6 months. Mean patient age was 38.75 years. All patients presented infectious syndrome and intracranial hypertension. The male:female sex ratio was 3:1. A history of chronic middle ear otitis was noted in two patients. Diagnosis of abscess in the posterior cerebral fossa was confirmed by CT-scan in 2 cases. Cholesteatoma and triventricular hydrocephaly were noted in 2 cases. All patients benefited from trepano-puncture of the abscess. Bacteriologic study of pus was positive for Staphylococcus aureus in 1 case, and Providencia Sp associated with Bacteroides fragilis in another. Second-stage radical mastoidectomy was performed in 2 cases. One patient died. The outcome was favorable in 3 cases. Because of the small size of the posterior cerebral fossa, abscess in that location requires emergency treatment. Delay can be life-threatening due to the risk of obstructive hydrocephaly and tonsillar herniation.
TI  - Characterization of BctA, a mating apparatus protein required for transfer of the Bacteroides fragilis conjugal element BTF-37.
AB  - We have previously described the identification of BTF-37, an autonomously transferable chromosomal element isolated from Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate LV23. In this study, we determined that BTF-37 harbors a 16kb conjugal transfer-encoding region that contains an almost identical copy of a previously identified Bacteroides sp. conjugation-specific gene bctA. BctA has been shown to be required for conjugation in other Bacteroides sp. strains, but no information is available regarding its function. We now report strain distribution and gene expression profiles of bctA. The bctA gene was present in conjugative transposon-harboring B. fragilis strains, but not on a non-transferable B. fragilis plasmid. We also showed that recombinant BctA predominantly localized to the bacterial membrane, and that its N-terminal 32 amino acids were cleaved in an Escherichia coli protein expression system, indicating the presence of a signal sequence. Expression of bctA consistently increased ~3-fold upon pre-exposure of conjugating B. fragilis LV23 to subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline. Maximum expression occurred 60min post-tetracycline induction, which also coincided with the time at which highest conjugation frequencies were seen for strain LV23. Based on localization, signal sequence and tetracycline inducibility, our results indicate that BctA is indeed an important member of the Bacteroides conjugal apparatus, since its gene is regulated by conditions that specifically control conjugation.
TI  - Antagonic effect of the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide on the mortality of  mice acutely infected with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Sepsis, the leading cause of death in intensive care units, is associated with overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) due to inducible NO synthase (iNOS), responsible for some of the pathologic changes. Aminoguanidine (AG) is a selective iNOS inhibitor with reported inconsistent actions in sepsis. To investigate the influence of iNOS, we studied models of acute bacterial sepsis using acute challenges with aerobic (Escherichia coli) and anaerobic (Bacteroides fragilis) bacteria in the presence of AG. Six-week-old, 23 g, male and female BALB/c and C57Bl/6j mice, in equal proportions, were inoculated (ip) with bacteria in groups of 4 animals for each dose and each experiment in the absence or presence of AG (50 mg/kg, ip, starting 24 h before challenge and daily until day 6) and serum nitrate was measured by chemiluminescence. Both types of bacteria were lethal to mice, with an LD50 of 6 nephelometric units (U) for E. coli and 8 U for B. fragilis. Nitrate production peaked on the second day after E. coli inoculation with 8 and 6 U (P < 0.05), but was absent after non-lethal lower doses. After challenge with B. fragilis this early peak occurred at all tested doses after 24 h, including non-lethal ones (P < 0.05). AG-treated mice challenged with E. coli presented higher survival (P < 0.05) and increased LD50. AG-treated mice challenged with B. fragilis had lower LD50 and higher mortality. Control AG-treated animals presented no toxic effects. The opposite effect of iNOS blockade by AG in these models could be explained by restriction of oxygen for immune cells or an efficient action of NO in anaerobic localized infections. The antagonic role of NO production observed in our bacterial models could explain the reported discrepancy of NO action in sepsis.
TI  - bft gene subtyping in enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis isolated from children with acute diarrhea.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains are associated with diarrhea  disease in farm animals and young children. In this study, the bft gene subtyping from ETBF strains recovered from one immunodeficient and two immunocompetent children with diarrhea were determined. Thirteen ETBF strains were isolated and by using a multiplex-PCR their bft subtypes were determined. All 13 ETBF strains harbored the bft-1 subtype and by AP-PCR they were clustered in the same group I. This study shows that ETBF strains can be present in acute diarrhea and that bft-1 subtype is often present in these organisms. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the role of this bft-1 subtype in the pathogenesis of diarrhea.
TI  - Plasmid-related resistance to cefoxitin in species of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves.
AB  - Species of the Bacteroides fragilis group are considered the most common anaerobe in human and animal infections and also harbor plasmids conferring resistance to several antibiotics. In this study, resistance to cefoxitin, plasmid profile and beta-lactamase production in species of the B. fragilis group isolated from intestinal tracts of calves were evaluated. One hundred sixty-one B. fragilis group bacteria isolated from calves with and without diarrhea were analyzed. Cefoxitin susceptibility was performed using an agar dilution method, beta-lactamase production by using a nitrocefin method, and plasmid extraction by using a commercial kit. Minimal inhibitory concentration values for cefoxitin ranged from 32 to > 512 microg/ml, and 47 bacteria (29.2%) were resistant to cefoxitin (breakpoint 16 microl). Only seven isolates harbored plasmids varying from 6.0 to 5.0 kb, and a 5.5-kb plasmid in B. vulgatus Bd26e and B. fragilis Bc5j might be related to cefoxitin resistance. beta-lactamase was detected in 33 (70.2%) isolates. The cepA gene was observed in total DNA and in the 5.5-kb plasmid. The plasmid presence in organisms isolated from cattle may be important in ecologic terms, and it needs further study.
TI  - A rapid assay of the sialidase activity in species of the Bacteroides fragilis group by using peanut lectin hemagglutination.
AB  - In this study, a novel, simple and rapid hemagglutination assay by using a peanut lectin to detect a neuraminidase activity in strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group was developed. One hundred and fourteen species of the B. fragilis group isolated from children with and without diarrhea and 15 reference strains were evaluated. Neuraminidase production was determined by using the method above described and its inhibition was observed by using galactose. The neuraminidase production was observed in 54 (84.37%) diarrhea and in 43 (86%) non-diarrhea strains. HA titers were ranged from 2 to 32. This neuraminidase assays based on PNA hemagglutination is highly sensitive, reproducible and could be used as a tool to detect the sialidase activity in anaerobic bacteria, particularly, in species of the B. fragilis group.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in Estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  - At present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. The objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the Estonian population. In total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. The anaerobes were isolated on Wilkins-Chalgren Agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam by E-tests. The results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of NCCLS. Data from the Estonian State Agency of Medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (Defined Daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). The following species of anaerobes were isolated: B. fragilis group, Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas sp., Prevotella sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified Gram-positive rods. Metronidazole resistance was not found among Gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in Estonia. Only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all anaerobes. Unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. In the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (DDD/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. High resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. We would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of the pathogenicity of the Bacteroides fragilis toxin gene subtypes in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) strains produce a metalloprotease toxin (BFT) related to diarrheal disease in animals, young children, and adults. Three different isoforms of the enterotoxin, designated BFT-1, BFT-2, and BFT-3, have been identified and sequenced. In the present study, the pathogenicity of the ETBF strains carrying bft-1 or bft-2 was evaluated. Each toxin gene subtype of ETBF (bft-1 or bft-2) was intragastrically monoassociated to germ-free mice during 10 days and histopathological data from intestines and liver compared with those from mice monoassociated to a non-enterotoxigenic B. fragilis. Histopathological alterations were observed in all groups of animals related to ETBF. These alterations were characterized mainly by ulceration, edema, and inflammatory infiltration in intestine. However, these lesions were slightly more severe in mice monoassociated with bft-2 subtype. No alteration or lesion was observed in animals associated with the non-enterotoxigenic B. fragilis. In conclusion, strains harboring bft-1 or bft-2 gene subtypes were able to induce histopathological alterations in intestine of a gnotobiotic mice model and it could explain the effect produced for the enterotoxin.
TI  - Occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). However, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to SDG conversion. Therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of SDG metabolising bacteria. The data showed differences in conversion efficiency between SDG deglycosylating species, but SDG was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. The strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db showed the highest initial rate of SDG deglycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides distasonis and B. fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. However, Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only two out of 20 faecal samples. Bacteria involved in the demethylation step of SDG conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than SDG. In particular, Peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. Finally, Eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin on the morphological, biochemical and genetic characteristics of Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - The effects of subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin on the morphological,  biochemical and genetic characteristics of species of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from children with diarrhea were determined. The minimal inhibitory and subinhibitory concentrations for clindamycin were determined. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 0.25 to 512 microg mL(-1) were observed. Cultures grown with clindamycin were used to determine the macroscopic morphological characteristics, cellular viability, ultrastructural characteristics and DNA integrity. Clindamycin did not alter colonial morphology, but after 6 h elongated cells were observed. Also, extracellular vesicles and electron-lucent areas inside the cytoplasm were observed. Bacteria treated with clindamycin also showed fragmentation of DNA as determined by electrophoresis. The alterations produced by clindamycin might be indicative of a possible modification of the structures involved in bacterial pathogenesis.
TI  - Phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) to the enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). However, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. Therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of SDG. Strains of Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db, deglycosylated SDG. Demethylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium callanderi, Eubacterium limosum and Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Clostridium scindens and Eggerthella lenta. Finally, the newly isolated strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ED to EL. The results indicate that the activation of SDG involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the in-vitro activity of seven antimicrobial agents, including ertapenem, against recently isolated Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in Greece.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of penicillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, ertapenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were evaluated against 138 Gram-negative anaerobic isolates (82 Bacteroides fragilis group, 17 non-fragilis Bacteroides spp., 31 Prevotella spp., four Fusobacterium spp., two Veillonella spp., one Porphyromonas sp. and one Tissierella praeacuta) collected from six general hospitals in Athens, Greece. Overall rates of non-susceptibility (both resistant and intermediately-resistant) to penicillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid were 81.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The rates of non-susceptibility to cefoxitin and clindamycin were 30.3% and 31.1%, respectively, and that for metronidazole was 4.3% (four Prevotella spp. isolates, one Porphyromonas sp. isolate and one B. fragilis isolate). Only the single B. fragilis isolate was nim-positive by PCR. Only one B. fragilis isolate was resistant to both carbapenems tested, while six more Bacteroides spp. isolates were imipenem-susceptible and ertapenem-non-susceptible. The MIC range, MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were comparable for imipenem and ertapenem, although ertapenem MIC(90)s were one or two two-fold dilutions higher.
TI  - Phenatic acids A and B, new potentiators of antifungal miconazole activity produced by Streptomyces sp. K03-0132.
AB  - Two new phenols, designated phenatic acids A and B, were isolated along with known actiphenol, from the culture of Streptomyces sp. K03-0132 by solvent extraction, silica gel column chromatography and HPLC. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses including mainly various NMR experiments. They have a common 1-hydroxy 2, 4-dimethyl benzene ring. These compounds potentiate miconazole activity against Candida albicans. Phenatic acid B also showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis and Acholeplasma laidlawii.
TI  - New antibiotic agents: problems and prospects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the third most common healthcare-associated infection, often leading to prolonged hospital stay and excessive expenditures. Management of these infections has become more challenging due to rising rates of multi-drug-resistant organisms and few new antibiotic options. METHODS: This paper reviews the literature, summarizes the epidemiology of surgical site infections and the threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and provides an insight into new treatment options for this condition. RESULTS: Patients with surgical site infections are at greater risk of acquiring healthcare-associated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) sp., and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis are also a growing problem. Several useful drugs have recently become available for the management of serious, gram-positive infections (e.g., daptomycin, linezolid, telithromycin). Tigecycline, the first-in-class glycylcycline, has broad-spectrum in vitro activity, including against MRSA, VRE, resistant enteric gram-negative bacilli (e.g., Acinetobacter sp.), "atypical" pathogens, and anaerobes. Phase 3 clinical trials suggest that tigecycline will be an excellent option for antibiotic monotherapy for complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSSI) and intra-abdominal infections. Oritavancin and dalbavacin, two novel glycopeptide antibiotics that are also in late-stage clinical development, appear that they, too, will be useful for cSSSI due to resistant, gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-drug-resistant pathogens are threatening the success of available antibiotic therapy. Many new options are useful for infections due to multi-drug-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. Tigecycline is a promising new agent that provides coverage against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative, aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic strains, including resistant isolates, and may make broad-spectrum, single-agent therapy possible.
TI  - "Bacteroides nordii" sp. nov. and "Bacteroides salyersae" sp. nov. isolated from  clinical specimens of human intestinal origin.
AB  - Two groups of unknown bacteria, which phenotypically resemble members of the Bacteroides fragilis group but phylogenetically display >5% 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence from their nearest validly described species, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, were characterized by phenotypic and molecular taxonomic methods. Phylogenetically and phenotypically, the unidentified bacteria displayed a relatively close association with each other. However, a 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence of approximately 4% between the two unknown bacteria, as well as distinguishable biochemical characteristics, demonstrates that these organisms are genotypically and phenotypically distinct, and each group may represent a previously unknown subline within the Bacteroides phylogenetic cluster. Subsequent DNA-DNA hybridization studies confirmed that the two novel organisms were indeed distinct from each other. The previously described species closest to both of them is B. thetaiotaomicron (approximately 94% sequence similarity), but they can be differentiated easily from B. thetaiotaomicron by virtue of not utilizing trehalose. DNA-DNA pairing studies also documented the separateness of the unknown species and B. thetaiotaomicron. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, two new species, "Bacteroides nordii" sp. nov. and "Bacteroides salyersae" sp. nov, are proposed. The G+C content of the DNA is 41.4 mol% for Bacteroides nordii and 42.0 mol% for Bacteroides salyersae. The type strains of Bacteroides nordii and Bacteroides salyersae are WAL 11050 (ATCC BAA-998 or CCUG 48943) and WAL 10018 (ATCC BAA-997 or CCUG 48945), respectively.
TI  - Plasmid-related beta-lactamase production in Bacteroides fragilis strains.
AB  - Twenty Bacteroides fragilis group species isolated from children with and without diarrhea were analyzed. Antibiotic susceptibility was performed using an agar dilution method; beta-lactamase production was determined using a nitrocefin method, and plasmids were extracted using a commercial Miniprep System. MIC values ranged from 16 to 256 microg/ml for penicillin, 4-128 microg/ml for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, 0.25-256 microg/ml for clindamycin, and 16-256 microg/ml for penicillin. beta-Lactamase was detected in all isolates. Only five isolates harbored plasmids varying from 7.8 to 1.8 kb. Loss of 6.4- and 3.8-kb plasmids in B. fragilis C68c was related to antibiotic resistance. Low molecular weight plasmids of 2.8-1.8 kb were stable. PCR amplification of cfiA and cepA genes was observed using total DNA, and the cfiA gene was also amplified from the 6.4-kb plasmid.
TI  - Survey of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from the intestinal tract of children.
AB  - The bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis group are considered important clinical  pathogens and they are the most common anaerobes isolated from human endogenous infections. In this study, the susceptibility patterns to antibiotics and metals of 114 species of the B. fragilis group isolated from children with and without diarrhea were determined. Susceptibility was assayed by using an agar dilution method with Wilkins-Chalgren agar. All B. fragilis strains were resistant to lead and nickel, but susceptible to metronidazole and imipenem. beta-lactamase production was detected by using biological and nitrocefin methods, respectively, in 50% and 90.6% of the isolates of children with diarrhea and in 60% and 90% of the isolates of children without diarrhea. Our results show an increase of antibiotics and metals resistance in this microbial group, and a periodic evaluation of the antimicrobial susceptibility is needed. In Brazil, the contamination for antibiotics or metal ions is often observed, and it is suggested an increase the antimicrobial resistance surveillance of this microbial group, mainly those isolated from children's diarrhea.
TI  - Virulence markers and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis group isolated from stool of children with diarrhea in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - Bacteroides fragilis has been isolated from several human and non-human monomicrobial and mixed infections. In this study, some virulence markers and the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria of the B. fragilis group isolated from children's stools were evaluated. All the 64 isolates showed the following characteristics: capsulated, beta-hemolytic, hydrophilic, and serum-resistant. Only, 24 (37.5%) strains were resistant at 60 masculine C, for 30 min, and among them, 12 (18.75%) were resistant at 60 masculine C, for 60 min. Also, none strain was resistant at 100 masculine C. Four strains were able to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and D-mannose, D-galactose, D-arabinose, and D-xylose inhibited hemagglutination in 2 B. fragilis strains (p76a, p76b). The hemagglutination in the strain B. uniformis p3-2 was inhibited by D-xylose and D-galactose. The bft gene detection and the enterotoxin production were observed only in 13 EF-enterotoxigenic species. Fragilysin activity was confirmed on HT-29 cells. The antimicrobial determination confirmed that both imipenem and metronidazole were efficient against B. fragilis species; all the strains were resistant to lead and nickel. Plasmids of 2.9, 4.4, 4.8, and 8.9 kb were observed in 6 tested strains. These results show the values of the species identification from clinical infections, as well as of the periodic evaluation of the resistance patterns of the B. fragilis group at Brazilian medical institutions.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - Identification and distribution of insertion sequences of Paracoccus solventivorans.
AB  - Three novel insertion sequences (ISs) (ISPso1, ISPso2, and ISPso3) of the soil bacterium Paracoccus solventivorans DSM 11592 were identified by transposition into entrapment vector pMEC1. ISPso1 (1,400 bp) carries one large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a putative basic protein (with a DDE motif conserved among transposases [Tnps] of elements belonging to the IS256 family) with the highest levels of similarity with the hypothetical Tnps of Rhodospirillum rubrum and Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida. ISPso2 (832 bp) appeared to be closely related to ISPpa2 of Paracoccus pantotrophus DSM 11072 and IS1248 of Paracoccus denitrificans PdX22, both of which belong to the IS427 group (IS5 family). These elements contain two overlapping ORFs and a putative frameshift motif (AAAAG) responsible for production of a putative transframe Tnp. ISPso3 (1,286 bp) contains a single ORF, whose putative product showed homology with Tnps of ISs classified as members of a distinct subgroup of the IS5 group of the IS5 family. The highest levels of similarity were observed with ISSsp126 of Sphingomonas sp. and IS1169 of Bacteroides fragilis. Analysis of the distribution of ISs of P. solventivorans revealed that ISPso2-like elements are the most widely spread of the elements in nine species of the genus PARACOCCUS: ISPso1 and ISPso3 are present in only a few paracoccal strains, which suggests that they were acquired by lateral transfer. Phylogenetic analysis of Tnps of the novel ISs and their closest relatives showed their evolutionary relationships and possible directions of lateral transfer between various bacterial hosts.
TI  - The influence of experimental Bacteroides fragilis infection on substance P and somatostatin-immunoreactive neural elements in the porcine ascending colon - a preliminary report.
AB  - The present study was aimed at disclosing the influence of Bacteroides fragilis (one of the most important bacterial agents causing colitis in children) experimental infection on the expression of substance P (SP) and somatostatin (SOM) in neurons and nerve fibres within the porcine ascending colon. Distinct differences in the distribution pattern of neural elements immunoreactive to the substances studied were observed between the experimental (Inflam) and control (Contr) pigs. In general, the number of SP-IR neurons and nerve terminals increased, while the expression of SOM decreased after Bacteroides fragilis-induced colitis (BFIC). However, distinct differences in the intensity of these alterations were observed between particular compartments of the bowel segment studied. Thus, the present results suggest that SP- and SOM-immunoreactive (SOM-IR) elements of the enteric nervous system play a part in the control of colonic activity during BFIC.
TI  - Detection of non-enterotoxigenic and enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis in stool samples from children in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - Non-enterotoxigenic bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis group and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis were identified from children with and without aqueous acute diarrhea. In this study, 170 stool samples from 96 children with and 74 without diarrhea were analyzed. Enterotoxin production and the toxin gene detection were detected by cytotoxicity assay on HT-29/C1 cells and by PCR, respectively. B. fragilis species was prevalent in both groups and enterotoxigenic B. fragilis strains were isolated from two children with diarrhea. More studies are important to evaluate the role of each bacteria of the B. fragilis group, including enterotoxigenic strains play in the diarrheal processes in children.
TI  - Reclassification of Bacteroides putredinis (Weinberg et al., 1937) in a new genus Alistipes gen. nov., as Alistipes putredinis comb. nov., and description of Alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., from human sources.
AB  - During studies on the bacteriology of appendicitis in children, we often isolated from inflamed and non-inflamed tissue samples, an unusual bile-resistant pigment-producing strictly anaerobic gram-negative rod. Phenotypically this organism resembles members of Bacteroides fragilis group of species, as it is resistant to bile and exhibits a special-potency-disk pattern (resistance to vancomycin, kanamycin and colistin) typical for the B. fragilis group. However, the production of brown pigment on media containing haemolysed blood and a cellular fatty acid composition dominated by iso-C15:0, suggests that the organism most closely resembles species of the genus Porphyromonas. However, the unidentified organism differs from porphyromonads by being bile-resistant and by not producing butyrate as a metabolic end-product. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism represents a distinct sub-line, associated with but distinct from, the miss-classified species Bacteroides putredinis. The clustering of the unidentified bacterium with Bacteroides putredinis was statistically significant, but they displayed > 4% sequence divergence with each other. Chromosomal DNA-DNA pairing studies further confirmed the separateness of the unidentified bacterium and Bacteroides putredinis. Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that Bacteroides putredinis and the unidentified bacterium from human sources be classified in a new genus Alistipes, as Alistipes putredinis comb. nov. and Alistipes finegoldii sp. nov., respectively. The type strain of Alistipes finegoldii is CCUG 46020(T) (= AHN243(T)).
TI  - Tension pneumopericardium caused by positive pressure ventilation complicating anaerobic pneumonia.
AB  - A 22-year-old man was admitted with pneumonia. He was immediately intubated and positive pressure ventilation was initiated. Blood and sputum cultures showed Bacteroides fragilis and Corynebacterium sp., which were treated with metronidazole and clindamycin. Three weeks later his blood pressure suddenly dropped with an elevation of the central venous pressure. Chest X-ray revealed a pneumopericardium. A parasternal mediastinotomy with partial pericardiectomy was immediately performed. On opening the pericardium his blood pressure normalised. The patient gradually recovered and six weeks after admission he was extubated. Two weeks later he was discharged. A pneumopericardium without previous thorax trauma is very rare and early recognition is imperative because a tension pneumopericardium with cardiac tamponade may develop, as happened in this case. A tension pneumopericardium has to be treated with immediate pericardiocentesis followed by partial pericardiectomy to avoid recurrence.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Cefditoren, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefditoren pivoxil, an oral third-generation cephalosporin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in September 2001. It has been used in Japan for several years. The greatest therapeutic potential of cefditoren appears to be its activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms causing respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefditoren is also effective against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Nevertheless, cefditoren has no activity against atypical pathogens, including Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella sp. Moreover, cefditoren does not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Bacteroides fragilis. In virtually all studies, cefditoren has compared favorably against other orally administered antibiotics used against the most commonly isolated respiratory tract pathogens. Its side effect profile includes diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, and dyspepsia. Cefditoren is indicated for treatment of mild-to-moderate acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis-tonsillitis, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by susceptible strains of organisms in adults and adolescents (> or = 12 yrs of age). Based on its reported antimicrobial activity, cefditoren has potential for empiric management of most commonly encountered respiratory tract infections. Additional studies will further define its role in clinical practice.
TI  - Clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp., Clostridium sp., and Fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. The strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. Predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. Organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. When anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. The early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.
TI  - Prevalence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli in routine clinical specimens.
AB  - A total of 206 gram negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 2591 routine clinical specimens. Majority of them (78.2%) were part of a mixed flora. A high incidence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli was found in post-operative wound infections and diabetic foot infections (30.1%), followed by necrotizing fasciitis and crush injuries (18%), pus of empyema and lung abscesses (14.5%) and aspirates from other deep abscesses (10.7%). Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently recognized species (42.2%), followed by Fusobacterium sp. (17.4%), Prevotella sp. (15.1%) and Porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). Neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. Gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - High prevalence of cfxA beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - This prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. Three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. One to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the Prevotella genus (Bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; Prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). PCR assays were used to detect cfxA and cepA/cblA, the genes encoding class A/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the Bacteroides fragilis group. The present investigation confirmed the role of Prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. Additionally, this PCR screening showed (1): the high prevalence of CfxA beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepA/cblA (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxA in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of cLV25, a Bacteroides fragilis chromosomal transfer factor resembling multiple Bacteroides sp. mobilizable transposons.
AB  - Horizontal DNA transfer contributes significantly to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes in Bacteroides fragilis. To further our understanding of DNA transfer in B. fragilis, we isolated and characterized a new transfer factor, cLV25. cLV25 was isolated from B. fragilis LV25 by its capture on the nonmobilizable Escherichia coli-Bacteroides shuttle vector pGAT400DeltaBglII. Similar to other Bacteroides sp. transfer factors, cLV25 was mobilized in E. coli by the conjugative plasmid R751. Using Tn1000 mutagenesis and deletion analysis of cLV25, two mobilization genes, bmgA and bmgB, were identified, whose predicted proteins have similarity to DNA relaxases and mobilization proteins, respectively. In particular, BmgA and BmgB were homologous to MocA and MocB, respectively, the two mobilization proteins of the B. fragilis mobilizable transposon Tn4399. A cis-acting origin of transfer (oriT) was localized to a 353-bp region that included nearly all of the intergenic region between bmgB and orf22 and overlapped with the 3' end of orf22. This oriT contained a putative nic site sequence but showed no significant similarity to the oriT regions of other transfer factors, including Tn4399. Despite the lack of sequence similarity between the oriTs of cLV25 and Tn4399, a mutation in the cLV25 putative DNA relaxase, bmgA, was partially complemented by Tn4399. In addition to the functional cross-reaction with Tn4399, a second distinguishing feature of cLV25 is that predicted proteins have similarity to proteins encoded not only by Tn4399 but by several Bacteroides sp. transfer factors, including NBU1, NBU2, CTnDOT, Tn4555, and Tn5520.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of BTF-37: chromosomal DNA captured from Bacteroides fragilis that confers self-transferability and expresses a pilus-like structure in Bacteroides spp. and Escherichia coli.
AB  - We report the isolation and preliminary characterization of BTF-37, a new 52-kb transfer factor isolated from Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolate LV23. BTF-37 was obtained by the capture of new DNA in the nonmobilizable Bacteroides-Escherichia coli shuttle vector pGAT400DeltaBglII using a functional assay. BTF-37 is self-transferable within and from Bacteroides and also self-transfers in E. coli. Partial DNA sequencing, colony hybridization, and PCR revealed the presence of Tet element-specific sequences in BTF-37. In addition, Tn5520, a small mobilizable transposon that we described previously (G. Vedantam, T. J. Novicki, and D. W. Hecht, J. Bacteriol. 181:2564-2571, 1999), was also coisolated within BTF-37. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of Tet element-containing Bacteroides spp. and BTF-37-harboring Bacteroides and E. coli strains revealed the presence of pilus-like cell surface structures. These structures were visualized in Bacteroides spp. only when BTF-37 and Tet element strains were induced with subinhibitory concentrations of tetracycline and resembled those encoded by E. coli broad-host-range plasmids. We conclude that we have captured a new, self-transferable transfer factor from B. fragilis LV23 and that this new factor encodes a tetracycline-inducible Bacteroides sp. conjugation apparatus.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria and intrahepatic stones: detections of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect anaerobic bacteria Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis  in intrahepatic stones by molecular genetic method. METHODS: DNA was extracted from 59 stone samples and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene of Clostridium sp. and the glutamine synthetase gene of Bacteroides fragilis. Single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed to identify the Clostridium sp. RESULTS: 16S rRNA gene sequences for Clostridium sp. were identified in 49 stones (83%, 49/59). The two most common groups were detected in 19 (41%) and 17 (37%) of the 46 samples using SSPC analysis, and 25/59 (42%) stones were tested positive for Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobes such as Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis present in intrahepatic stones and may play a role in stone formation. PCR is a useful technique to detect fastidious pathogens, which are difficult to culture. SSCP of PCR products is a rapid method in differentiating bacterial species.
TI  - Substance P immunoreactive sensory axons as a subset of the total axonal population in the maxillary sinus of the rabbit: a characterization of normal and infected mucosa.
AB  - Substance P (SP), one of the neuropeptides released from sensory nerves, is thought to mediate neurogenic inflammation. Although SP immunoreactive axons have been described in the sinus mucosa, no attempt has been made to characterize SP fibers as a subset of all axons present in the sinus mucosa. In addition, no study to date has characterized the changes in infected sinus mucosa. The maxillary sinus mucosa of New Zealand white rabbits was harvested from control animals and in animals with induced maxillary sinusitis. Immunohistochemical staining of the sinus mucosa for both Protein Gene Product 9.5 (PGP), a nonspecific marker for all nerves, and for SP was performed on 11 animals: 3 controls and 8 infected. In sinus mucosa from the control rabbits, <50% of all axons labeled by PGP were immunoreactive for SP. In infected mucosa, the absolute number of axons found by PGP staining decreased and nearly all of these remaining fibers were also immunoreactive for SP. We conclude that the phenotypical labeling of nerve fibers seen in normal mucosa is altered by bacterial-induced infection.
TI  - Bacteroides acidifaciens sp. nov., isolated from the caecum of mice.
AB  - During studies of the bacterial flora in the intestines of mice, we isolated characteristic strains which lowered the pH of peptone-yeast broth containing Fildes' digest. Based on 16S rRNA sequence comparison, these isolates were considered to belong to the Bacteroides cluster in the bacteroides subgroup of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides phylum, and were divided into two groups. Their phenotypic characteristics, i.e. growth in 20% bile, aesculin hydrolysis, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH) activity, were the same as those of the 'Bacteroides fragilis group'. The low level of DNA-DNA hybridization with type strains in the Bacteroides cluster confirmed the novel species status of these isolates. It is proposed that these isolates be named Bacteroides acidifaciens, the type strain of which is A40T (= JCM 10556T).
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infection following spinal fusion in  children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of wound infections following spinal fusion in children. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and microbiological records. RESULTS: Aspirates of pus from 18 infection sites showed bacterial growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 3 (17%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 3 (17%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (67%). Forty-two isolates were recovered: 18 anaerobes (1.0 isolates per specimen) and 24 aerobes (1.3 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp. (9 isolates, including 8 Bacteroides fragilis group) and 5 Peptostreptococcus sp. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (6) and Proteus sp. (5). An increase in recovery of E. coli and B. fragilis was noted in children with bowel or bladder incontinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in wound infections following spinal fusion in children.
TI  - [Trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  - Presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (LGT) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. It is currently accepted that infections of the LGT are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. This means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. Lactobacillus sp. and Corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with Streptococcus (aerobe), Streptococcus agalactiae and others like Enterococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides sp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli. Different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). They are discussed in different sections. Trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to Chlamydia with excellent clinical results and a good tolerance. It was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. New fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. The use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of T-3811ME, a novel des-F(6)-quinolone, were evaluated in comparison with those of some fluoroquinolones, including a newly developed one, trovafloxacin. T-3811, a free base of T-3811ME, showed a wide range of antimicrobial spectra, including activities against Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In particular, T-3811 exhibited potent activity against various gram-positive cocci, with MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of 0.025 to 6.25 microgram/ml. T-3811 was the most active agent against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci, including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). T-3811 also showed potent activity against quinolone-resistant gram-positive cocci with GyrA and ParC (GrlA) mutations. The activity of T-3811 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermentative gram-negative rods was comparable to that of trovafloxacin. In common with other fluoroquinolones, T-3811 was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Legionella sp., with MIC90s of 0.0125 to 0.1 microgram/ml. T-3811 showed a potent activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium difficile. T-3811 was the most active agent against C. trachomatis (MIC, 0.008 microgram/ml) and M. pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.0313 microgram/ml). The activity of T-3811 against M. tuberculosis (MIC90, 0.0625 microgram/ml) was potent and superior to that of trovafloxacin. In experimental systemic infection with a GrlA mutant of S. aureus and experimental pneumonia with PRSP in mice, T-3811ME showed excellent therapeutic efficacy in oral and subcutaneous administrations.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of the catalase gene from Rhizobium sp. SNU003, a  root nodule symbiont of Canavalia lineata.
AB  - A catalase gene from Rhizobium sp. SNU003, a root nodule symbiont of Canavalia lineata, was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. The Rhizobium DNA of about 280 bp was amplified using two PCR primers synthesized from the conserved sequences of the type I catalase gene. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment revealed three regions that were conserved in the catalase, showing it as being part of the catalase gene. A genomic Southern hybridization using this fragment as a probe showed that the 5.5 kb PstI, 1.8 kb EcoRI, and 0.7 kb StyI fragments hybridized strongly with the probe. The Rhizobium genomic library constructed into the EMBL3 vector was screened, and one catalase clone was selected. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.5 kb PstI fragment from the clone revealed an open reading frame of 1455 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 485 amino acids with a molecular mass of 54,958 Da and a pI of 6.54. The predicted amino acid sequence of the catalase is 66.3% identical to that of Bacteroides fragilis, but was only 53.3% identical to the Rhizobium meliloti catalase.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infection following spinal fusion.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of surgical-site infections (SSI) following spinal fusion was retrospectively studied. This was done by reviewing the clinical and microbiological records at the Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md., from 1980 to 1992. Aspirates of pus from 25 infection sites showed bacterial growth. Aerobic bacteria only were recovered from 9 (36%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria only were recovered from 4 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 12 (48%). Sixty isolates were recovered: 38 aerobes (1.5 isolates per specimen) and 22 anaerobes (0.9 isolate per specimen). The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (n = 8) and Proteus sp. (n = 7). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 9) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (n = 6) isolates. An increase in recovery of E. coli and B. fragilis was noted in patients with bowel or bladder incontinence. This study highlights the polymicrobial nature of SSI and the importance of anaerobic bacteria in SSI following spinal fusion.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid from Flavobacterium sp. KP1, a psychrophilic bacterium.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid found at high copy number was isolated from Flavobacterium sp.  KP1, a psychrophilic Gram-negative bacterium, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number AB007196. The pFL1 plasmid is 2311 nucleotides in length with 32.7% GC content, and shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other plasmids of similar length. The plasmid contains two open reading frames of significant length, ORFI and ORFII. ORFI encodes a protein similar to the replication proteins found in Gram-negative bacterial plasmids, Bacteroides fragilis plasmid pBI143 and Zymomonas mobilis plasmid pZM2. The putative translation product of ORFII shows homologies with plasmid recombination proteins found mainly in Gram-positive bacterial plasmids such as Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181.
TI  - The effect of vaginal microbes on in vivo and in vitro expression of human papillomavirus 16 E6-E7 genes.
AB  - Since other viruses can influence expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6-E7 genes in vitro, this study addressed whether specific vaginal bacteria do so as well. The vaginal microflora of 18 women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or normal histology and HPV 16 infection, was evaluated by quantitative culture. Expression of HPV 16 E6-E7 oncogenes was assessed in exfoliated cervical cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HPV 16 expression was also quantitated in CaSki carcinoma cell line cocultured with Bacteroides fragilis or Lactobacillus acidophilus. Isolation of Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.05) and expression of the E6*II transcript (p = 0.03) were associated with low-grade CIN or normal histology. However, changes in E6-E7 expression were not associated independently with isolation of a specific microorganism. Similarly, expression of HPV 16 E6-E7 oncogenes in vitro was unaltered in the presence of bacteria. These results suggest that vaginal microorganisms are unlikely to alter the natural history of HPV-associated CIN by influencing HPV oncogene expression.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Cloning of an EF-P homologue from Bacteroides fragilis that increases B. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Investigations of possible regulators of Bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (GS) activity were done in Escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. The B. fragilis glnA gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pACYC184 and expressed in the E. coli glnA ntrB ntrC deletion strain, YMC11. GS activity was monitored following co-transformation with a B. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pEcoR251. A gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in B. fragilis GS activity but did not affect the activity of the E. coli GS enzyme or the B. fragilis sucrase (ScrL). Deletion of the B. fragilis glnA downstream region decreased basal levels of GS activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the B. fragilis GS activity. Reporter gene analysis, using the B. fragilis glnA promoter region fused to the promoterless Clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. This demonstrated that the increase in GS activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. Sequence data indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor P (EF-P) proteins, the highest being to that of a Synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to Mycobacterium genitalium (27%). Amino acid identity to the E. coli EF-P was intermediate (37%). A possible role for EF-P in enhancing translation of the B. fragilis glnA mRNA is proposed.
TI  - Microbiology of necrotizing fasciitis associated with omphalitis in the newborn infant.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis in newborn infants. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review was done of the author's 20-year experience. RESULTS: Specimens obtained from 11 newborn infants with periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 38 bacterial isolates was recovered: 21 aerobic and facultative and 17 anaerobic. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 1 specimen (9%), anaerobes only in 2 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 8 (73%). Multiple organisms were recovered from all instances and the number of isolates varied from two to six (average 3.5 isolates per specimen). The predominant isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp. (7 isolates); Bacteroides fragilis group (6); streptococcus group B (4); and Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group D, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis (3 each). All patients underwent extensive debridement and resection, and they received supportive and antimicrobial therapy. Six (55%) of the patients died. CONCLUSIONS: These findings illustrate the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of periumbilical necrotizing fasciitis.
TI  - Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ.
AB  - We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast, tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriologic and therapeutic considerations in intra-abdominal surgical infections.
AB  - The most important factor in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections are early diagnosis and prompt surgical intervention while antibiotics play a secondary role. The goals of surgical procedures should be to stop peritoneal contamination, to debride necrotic tissue, to remove debris and foreign bodies and to drain any pus collection. Antibiotics should be initiated before surgery and they must encompass both colonic aerobes and anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis group but not necessary Enterococcus sp. Antibacterial agents with pure activity against anaerobes include chloramphenicol, clindamycin and the nitroimidazoles while ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, cefoxitin, cefotetan, ceftizoxime imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem and some advanced quinolones like sparfloxacin, represent a single drug to cover both aerobic and anaerobic microflora. Although almost all clinical trials usually result in a 90% efficacy rate, the final outcome is dependant on the stage of the infection (early versus late), sepsis score, underlying diseases and the applied surgical procedures. On the other hand the choice of antibiotic(s) must be influenced by its toxicity, profiles local nosocomial susceptibility patterns, resistance inducing ability and price.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infected hemorrhoids. METHODS: Retrospective review of the clinical microbiology records. RESULTS: Aspirates of pus from infected hemorrhoids in 19 patients showed bacterial growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in six (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in one (5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 12 (63%). Sixty-eight isolates were recovered: 39 anaerobes (2.1 isolates per specimen) and 29 aerobes (1.5 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp. (13 isolates, including 10 Bacteroides fragilis groups) and 13 Peptostreptococcus sp. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (7), Proteus sp. (5), group D streptococci (4), and Pseudomonas sp. (3). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in infected hemorrhoids.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Bacteroides infections in children.
AB  - From 1974 to 1990, 336 Bacteroides isolates were obtained from 312 specimens from 274 patients. They comprised 180 (54%) B. fragilis isolates, 55 (16%) B. theta-iotaomicron, 36 (11%) B. vulgatus, 34 (10%) B. distasonis, 21 (6%) B. ovatus and 10 (3%) B. uniformis. Infections in 253 (92%) patients were polymicrobial, but in 21 (8%) children, a Bacteroides sp. was isolated in pure culture. Most Bacteroides isolates were from peritoneal fluid (114), abscesses (110), wound infections (20), blood cultures (10) and from patients with pneumonia (14) or chronic otitis media (8). Predisposing conditions were present in 145 (53%) children; these were previous surgery (46), trauma (28), malignancy (21), prematurity (19), immunodeficiency (18), steroid therapy (12) foreign body (10), diabetes (9) and sickle cell disease (7). The micro-organisms isolated most commonly mixed with Bacteroides spp. were anaerobic cocci (221), Escherichia coli (122), Fusobacterium spp. (38) and Clostridium spp. (30). All patients received antimicrobial therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage or correction of pathology in 197 (72%) cases. All but 12 (5%) patients recovered. These data illustrate the importance of Bacteroides spp. in infections in children.
TI  - Antibiotic GE37468 A: a new inhibitor of bacterial protein synthesis. I. Isolation and characterization.
AB  - GE37468 A is a new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic obtained by fermentation of Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 55365. It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by acting on elongation factor Tu and is structurally and functionally related to the GE2270 class of EF-Tu inhibitors. It is active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides fragilis, and protects mice against Staphylococcus aureus infection.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - A new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnN gene supports nitrogen assimilation in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.
AB  - A new glutamine synthetase gene, glnN, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (M(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (GS) in this cyanobacterium. The functionality of this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an Escherichia coli glnA mutant and to support Synechocystis growth in a strain whose glnA gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. In this mutant (strain SJCR3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second GS activity was subject to regulation by the nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. Transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnN suggested that synthesis of the second Synechocystis GS is regulated at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the level of glnN mRNA, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. The glnN product is similar to the GS subunits of Bacteroides fragilis and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose GSs are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic GSs. However, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the GSs so far described. The new GS gene was also found in other cyanobacteria but not in N2-fixing filamentous species.
TI  - Piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. The Piperacillin/tazobactam Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. METHODS: This was a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. Patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. One group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. Cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. The most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). The most common microorganisms recovered included: Peptostreptococcus sp (99), Prevotella sp (87), black pigmented Bacteroides (29), B fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group B streptococcus (26), Escherichia coli (31), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and C trachomatis (19). A favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin patients. Among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. Diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; P = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. None of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. CONCLUSION: The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  - This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. Two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. Septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. The parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. The most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. In both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium sp. and Peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. High mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly Escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly Bacteroides fragilis. All antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. Metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. The lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. Finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - [Polymicrobial infections in recurrent tonsillitis and adenoiditis in children].
AB  - Bacteriological examination focused on the aerobic and anaerobic flora from ectomized tonsils in 17 patients with recurrent tonsillitis, in 8 patients with hypertrophy of the tonsils and 122 children with an adenoid vegetation confirmed microbial aetiology. In ectomized tonsils and adenoids aerobic gram-positive bacteria comprised most frequently staphylococci, and gram-negative bacteria H. influenzae. As to anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, they isolated most frequently peptostreptococci, and as to gram-negative ones B. fragilis from tonsils and Bacteroides sp. from adenoids. In the treatment of recurrent infections of the upper respiratory pathways it is important to use preferentially aminopenicillins combined with beta-lactamase inhibitors and lincosamides.
TI  - Value of cultures of tissue samples taken at operation for lower intestinal perforation.
AB  - Tissue cultures from perforations of the lower intestinal tract commonly yield both aerobes (coliform organisms) and anaerobes (Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium sp.). To determine the consistency of this pattern and the value of intraoperative cultures, the authors reviewed the hospital records of 115 patients with perforation of the appendix (100 patients) or colon (15 patients), treated between 1987 and 1990, in whom organisms were cultured from tissue samples taken intraoperatively. Attention was paid to the organisms cultured, their distribution and antibiotic sensitivity in initial samples and in subsequent samples obtained when there were septic complications. On average, 4.7 bacterial isolates per patient were obtained. The common organisms were as expected: Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli and Clostridium sp. Although the culture results did not affect the management of these patients, the sensitivity of Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin was found to be lower than expected, indicating a shift in sensitivity.
TI  - Oral infectivity and bacterial interactions with mononuclear phagocytes.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify the association between the oral infectivity of a bacterial strain and its susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them. Ten bacterial strains tested--all of known oral infectivity--comprised Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes (three strains), Escherichia coli (two strains), Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, and a Bacteroides sp. The phagocytic uptake of each strain was measured as the bacteria to phagocyte ratio after mononuclear phagocytes in mouse peritoneal exudate were permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo for 3 min. The three Listeria strains were the most susceptible to phagocytic uptake and the Salmonella strain was relatively resistant. The intracellular survival of each strain was studied during a subsequent 2 h in-vitro incubation of the mononuclear phagocytes that had been permitted to ingest bacteria in vivo. The strains with the best intracellular survival were Ent. faecalis and two of the three Listeria strains. The ability of S. typhimurium to survive intracellularly was intermediate but better than that of the two E. coli strains. Oral infectivity was not consistently correlated with susceptibility to ingestion by mononuclear phagocytes or ability to survive within them.
TI  - In-vitro susceptibility and in-vivo efficacy of antimicrobials in the treatment of intraabdominal sepsis in mice.
AB  - Cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, ceftizoxime, imipenem plus cilastatin, ampicillin plus sulbactam and clindamycin alone or combined with gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or aztreonam were compared in the therapy of intraabdominal infection in mice caused by Escherichia coli in combination with either Bacteroides fragilis or Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Mortality in the control group was 45%, and no animal receiving either imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin or aztreonam died. Mortality in mice receiving cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole, or ceftizoxime was below 7% (P < 0.05%) and mortality following treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam was 23-27% (P > 0.05). The abscesses were examined ten days after inoculation. No abscesses were observed in mice treated with clindamycin or imipenem. Therapy with gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, aztreonam or ceftizoxime alone did not prevent abscess formation by both Bacteroides sp. A significant reduction in abscess formation and number of E. coli and B. fragilis was observed with combination therapy of clindamycin with either ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, aztreonam, or gentamicin and single agent therapy with either imipenem, cefoxitin, cefotetan, cefmetazole and ampicillin-sulbactam alone. However, cefotetan and cefmetazole did not reduce abscess formation or the number of B. thetaiotaomicron. These in-vivo data confirm the in-vitro activity of these antimicrobials.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - Microbiology of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
AB  - Specimens obtained from 67 infants with secondarily infected diaper dermatitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Bacteria growth was obtained in 58. Aerobic facultative bacteria or Candida sp. only were present in 28 patients (48%), anaerobic bacteria only in 11 (19%), and mixed anaerobic with aerobic, facultative, or yeast flora was present in 19 (33%). Ninety-one bacterial or fungal isolates were recovered (1.6 per specimen), 54 (0.9 per specimen) aerobic or facultative bacteria, 8 (0.1 per specimen) Candida sp., and 31 (0.6 per specimen) strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (23 isolates), Streptococcus sp. (16), and Escherichia coli (6). The predominant anaerobes included Bacteroides sp. (12, including 9 Bacteroides fragilis group) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (11). Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 32 (55%) patients, 18 of which were S. aureus. Twenty-five beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were detected in 22 (51%) of the 43 tested patients. These included 16 S. aureus and 6 B. fragilis group. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial nature of secondarily infected diaper dermatitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  - The bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. Predisposing conditions were present in all instances. Sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. The abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients. There were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 Bacteroides fragilis group), Fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and Prevotella sp. and Actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). A total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 Gram-positive cocci and 6 Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of anaerobic infections of the head and neck.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria are important pathogens in head and neck infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, chronic mastoiditis, head and neck abscesses, cervical adenitis, parotitis, and postoperative infection. Bacteroides sp (Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides fragilis group), Peptostreptococcus sp, and Fusobacterium sp predominate. The observed recent increase in the number of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Bacteroides sp isolated in head and neck infections has been associated with increased failure rates of the penicillins in the management of these infections. The pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. Because of these direct and indirect virulent characteristics of anaerobic bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - The acute phase of experimental infection with Trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - 1. The influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain CL of Trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic CFW (LOB) mice monoassociated with Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus sp or Clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. Significantly earlier parasitemia peak and mortality were observed in Bacteroides fragilis- and Clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). More precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in Peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. The extent of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, B. fragilis-associated, Clostridium-associated, and Peptostreptococcus-associated animals. The levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, Peptostreptococcus-associated, Clostridium-associated, and B. fragilis-associated mice. 4. These results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with T. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. This suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with T. cruzi.
TI  - Infection and labor. VII. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in spontaneous rupture of membranes at term.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency, microbiologic characteristics, and clinical significance of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity in women with premature rupture of membranes at term. STUDY DESIGN: Amniocentesis was performed in 32 women with term premature rupture of membranes and amniotic fluid cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and Mycoplasmas. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was 34.3% (11/32). The most common isolates were Ureaplasma urealyticum, Peptostreptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Fusobacterium sp. Clinical chorioamnionitis occurred only in one patient with a positive amniotic fluid culture. Her neonate had ophthalmitis. Three patients (9.4%) had endometritis. Among women who were delivered vaginally, those with a positive amniotic fluid culture had a significantly higher rate of endometritis than those with a negative culture (33% [3/9] vs 0% [0/20], respectively, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity occurs in approximately one third of patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes. Microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity is a risk factor for endometritis in women with term premature rupture of membranes.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - [Surgical treatment of acute bacteroid purulent cholangitis].
AB  - The results of treatment of 40 patients with acute purulent cholangitis developed against the background of choledocholithiasis are presented. Bacteroid of the kind B. fragilis (67.5% of cases), Fusobacterium, Lactobacillus sp. (30%) are the leading etiological factor of cholangitis. The indications for external and internal drainage of the bile ducts are substantiated. The ineffectiveness of internal drainage in this disease is demonstrated.
TI  - Bacterial vaginosis.
AB  - In the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. Accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis Bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, Gardnerella vaginalis and Mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in Lactobacillus sp. Excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and G. Vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal pH constitute the hallmark of diagnosis. The pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. Bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. It is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. Therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. Women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. The cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. New data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. No evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - [Influence of cefodizime via intravenous bolus injection on human fecal flora].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was given to 8 healthy male volunteers with ages 23-28 years (mean: 24 years) and body weights 54-73 kg (mean: 64 kg). 4 volunteers received 2 g b.i.d., intravenous infusion for 5 days, and 4 volunteers had 4 g b.i.d. for the same duration. We studied changes in bacterial flora and drug levels in feces, as well as changes in susceptibility of isolated microbes to CDZM, cefmetazole, cefotaxime (CTX) and cefoperazone. Adverse drug reactions and changes in laboratory findings were also investigated. The following results were obtained. 1. In fecal flora for the 2 g b.i.d. group, on day 3 of treatment Enterobacteriaceae were identified in only 2 of the 4 cases. Individual microbe counts decreased or fell below detection limit (10(2) cells/g) on day 3 of treatment. Colony forming units (CFUs) of Enterobacteriaceae on day 5 of treatment were similar to those on day 3. After the end of treatment, its CFUs increased. The mean CFU of Enterobacteriaceae on day 10 after the end of treatment increased to about the same level as before dosing. However, some microbes did not revert to pretreatment levels. Of other Gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas sp. increased in one case transiently on day 3 of treatment. After day 3 of treatment, its CFU decreased. Gram-positive microbes showed various changes. Mean CFU of yeast like organism (YLO) increased between day 3 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment and its mean CFU decreased on day 10 after the treatment. As for anaerobes, CFUs of Bacteroides fragilis group organisms and overall anaerobes showed no distinctive changes. Clostridium difficile were detected in two cases. In one case, C. difficile was noted at levels between 1.1 X 10(3) cells/g and 2.0 X 10(6) cells/g at the following sampling times: days 1 and 3 of treatment and days 3, 5, 10 and 20 after the end of treatment. In other case, it was noted at levels of 1.8 X 10(5) cells/g on day 20 after the end of treatment. D-1 toxin was detected in one case before dosing, and in three cases (the concentration of D-1 toxin was 250 ng/g or 500 ng/g) on day after treatment. Enterobacteriaceae in fecal flora of 4 cases given 4 g b.i.d. frequently decreased or fell below detection limit on days 3 and 5 of treatment and day 3 after the end of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  - The microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. Aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and Staphylococcus aureus (10). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 Bacteroides fragilis group and 5 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and Fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. These included all 8 tested S aureus and 7 B fragilis group, 3 of 10 H influenzae, 2 of 4 B melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most cases of S pneumoniae and H influenzae were associated with pneumonia. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. The data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.
TI  - Multicenter in vitro comparison of piperacillin and nine other antibacterials against 1,629 clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial spectrum of activity of piperacillin was compared with that of  other antibiotics against isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius, and Clostridium difficile obtained from laboratories at hospitals in St. Louis, in Memphis, and in Newark, New Jersey. Of the 1,629 isolates tested, 91% were susceptible to piperacillin, 90% to mezlocillin, 87% to ticarcillin/clavulanate and imipenem, 83% to ceftazidime, 81% to cefoperazone, 80% to ciprofloxacin, 77% to ceftriaxone, 71% to aztreonam, and 51% to cefoxitin.
TI  - The role of bacterial vaginosis as a cause of amniotic fluid infection, chorioamnionitis and prematurity--a review.
AB  - Antepartum bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy has been related to premature delivery, the recovery of microorganisms from amniotic fluid of women in premature labor with intact membranes, to histologic chorioamnionitis and to the recovery of microorganisms from the placenta or membranes. Microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are commonly recovered from the amniotic fluid and chorioamnion of patients who deliver prematurely. In addition, bacterial vaginosis is associated with maternal infectious morbidity during labor and in the postpartum period. Very little is known of the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which bacterial vaginosis may cause preterm labor and/or premature rupture of the membranes. However, it is of interest to speculate on possible mechanisms. The high concentration of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in the vagina and cervix of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may increase the possibility of an ascending infection via the cervix, decidua, fetal membranes, maternal placenta, and amniotic fluid. Some of the bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis such as Bacteroides sp. are particularly virulent. Certain bacteria produce enzymes that potentially could affect the fetal membranes or maternal deciduae. Bacteroides sp. and group B streptococcus produce proteases. Protease enzymes reduce the chorioamniotic membrane strength in vitro. It is even possible that a high concentration of bacteria in the lower genital tract could produce enough proteases to weaken the fetal membrane strength causing premature rupture of the membranes. Bacterial lipases could also produce tissue injury. Schwarz et al. demonstrated that lysosomes within fetal membrane cells contain phospholipase A2 in high concentrations. Phospholipase A2 is a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis and the destruction of lysosomes within deciduae or chorioamnion cells may induce prostaglandin synthesis resulting in uterine contractions. Bejar et al. found a high rate of phospholipase A2 production by Bacteroides sp., anaerobic streptococci, Fusobacterium sp., and G. vaginalis. Benett et al. demonstrated that bacterial products of group B streptococci, viridans streptococci, Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis but not of Lactobacillus sp. increase the synthesis of prostaglandins in the membranes. Thus, selected bacteria, including some closely related to bacterial vaginosis may play a role in the initiation of uterine contractions by stimulating prostaglandin synthesis. In an alternative mechanism, either the release of prostaglandin in the membrane or uterine contraction could cause microbreaks of the membrane that allow bacterial colonization of the membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of intra-abdominal abscesses in children.
AB  - In this study of the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 23 intra-abdominal abscesses, aerobic bacteria alone were present in one specimen, anaerobic bacteria only in four, and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora in 18. Ninety bacterial isolates (3.9 isolates per specimen), 63 anaerobic (2.7 per specimen), and 27 aerobic and facultative (1.2 per specimen) isolates were recovered. The predominant organisms were Bacteroides fragilis group (23 isolates), Peptostreptococcus sp (20 isolates), and Escherichia coli (15 isolates). This study demonstrates the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic etiology of intra-abdominal abscesses in children.
TI  - New diterpenoid antibiotics, spirocardins A and B.
AB  - New antibiotics spirocardins A and B were isolated from the culture broth of an actinomycete isolated from a soil sample collected near Lake Hibara, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The producing strain was classified as Nocardia sp. SANK 64282. The antibiotics were isolated from the culture filtrate by solvent extraction and purified further by silica gel and preparative reverse phase column chromatography. They were primarily active against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and limited species of Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They were also moderately active against several species of Mycoplasma. The molecular formulae of spirocardins A and B were C20H30O6 and C20H32O6, respectively. From their physico-chemical characteristics they were revealed to be diterpenoid antibiotics with closely related structures and the former was easily converted to the latter by the reduction with NaBH4.
TI  - Accuracy and reproducibility of the 4-hour ATB 32A method for anaerobe identification.
AB  - The ATB 32A system (API System SA, La Balme les Grottes, Montalieu-Vercieu, France) was evaluated for use in the identification of 214 anaerobes. Organisms included 73 isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 24 Bacteroides spp., 10 fusobacteria, 43 clostridia, 28 cocci, and 36 gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. With the concomitant use of Gram stain, pigmentation, catalase testing, and aerobic growth, the ATB 32A system correctly identified 97% of the B. fragilis group isolates, 88% of Bacteroides spp., 50% of fusobacteria, 74% of clostridia, 100% of cocci, and 86% of the gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Overall, 188 strains (88%) were correctly identified, with 18 (8%) requiring extra tests, other than the four mentioned above, for correct identification. Eight strains were misidentified, including one Bacteroides sp., three fusobacteria, one Clostridium sp., and three gram-positive, nonsporeforming rods. Reproducibility was very good, with 12 of 14 strains (86%) tested in triplicate yielding identical correct results on each of three occasions and 2 strains (14%) yielding identical correct results on two occasions. There was a low-probability identification (including the correct species) on the third testing. The ATB 32A system represents a worthwhile advance in systems used for the identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Microbiology of infected pilonidal sinuses.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from infected pilonidal sinuses in 75 patients showed bacterial  growth. Anaerobic bacteria only were recovered in 58 (77%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in three (4%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 14 (19%). Two hundred and nine isolates were recovered: 147 anaerobes (2.0 isolates a specimen) and 62 aerobes (0.8 a specimen). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp (81 isolates, including 29 Bacteroides fragilis group) and 51 anaerobic cocci. The predominant aerobes were Escherichia coli (n = 15), Proteus sp (n = 9), group D streptococcus (n = 7), and Pseudomonas sp (n = 7). This study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobic bacteria in infected pilonidal sinuses.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Direct and indirect pathogenicity of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in mixed infections in children.
AB  - The recent emergence of numerous aerobic and anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacterial strains has been associated with an increase in the failure rate of penicillins in the therapy of infection caused by these organisms. These include respiratory tract, skin of soft tissue, female genital tract, intra-abdominal, and other miscellaneous infections. The important aerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) include Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella sp. The anaerobic BLPB are all Bacteroidiaceae and include Bacteroides fragilis group, B. melaninogenicus group, B. oralis, B. oris-buccae, and Fusobacterium sp. Laboratory, animal, and clinical studies that support the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms and the distribution of these BLPB in various infections are reviewed. BLPB may not only have a direct pathogenic role in causing the infection, but also an indirect pathogenic role. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy, but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of aerobic and anaerobic BLPB require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of Bacteroides fragilis and  B. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate Bacteroides fragilis strains and Escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of the B. melaninogenicus group and Streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. Single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. Single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (S. pyogenes, E. coli or Bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. However, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. Combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. Non-capsulate Bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either S. pyogenes or E. coli. Therapy directed at the elimination of S. pyogenes and E. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate Bacteroides spp. These data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the B. fragilis group and E. coli and between the B. melaninogenicus group and S. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of PD 127,391, an enhanced-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 127,391, a dihalogenated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, and cefuroxime against 525 recent isolates and well-characterized antimicrobial agent-resistant strains. The MICs of PD 127,391 against 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides fragilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria sp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml. Some 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci were susceptible to 0.25 micrograms of PD 127,391 per ml. Against most strains, PD 127,391 was 2- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin, but it was 64-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against B. fragilis. Strains of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to nalidixic acid were less susceptible to all of the quinolones tested, including PD 127,391. The MIC and minimum lethal concentration of PD 127,391 against three strains of Chlamydia trachomatis were each 0.06 microgram/ml, and the MIC against 90% of 21 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 1 microgram/ml. PD 127,391 was less active at pH 5, its maximal activity being at pH 7 to 8. The presence of urine at pH 5.9 decreased the bactericidal activity. The protein binding of PD 127,391 was 2 to 7%, and serum had little effect on activity.
TI  - Use of antibiotics in the management of postirradiation wound infection and sepsis.
AB  - Ionizing gamma irradiation depresses the host defenses and enhances the susceptibility of the immunocompromised host to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. Trauma and wounding act synergistically and decrease the survival after exposure to irradiation. The current antimicrobial agents suitable for controlling serious infections and their use in post irradiation local and systemic infection with and without trauma are discussed. The experience gained in managing immunocompromised patients following chemotherapy is reviewed. Empiric single agent or combination agent therapy should be directed at the eradication of potential gram-negative as well as gram-positive pathogens. The most important organisms known to cause these infections are Pseudomonas sp. and Enterobacteriaceae. Management of intra-abdominal infections following trauma should include early surgical correlation and antimicrobials directed against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes cause most skin and soft tissue infections following trauma. Chemoprophylaxis of enteric sources of systemic infection can be achieved by antimicrobials that selectively inhibit the Enterobacteriaceae sp. and preserve the anaerobic flora. The management of infection in the injured and irradiated host includes supportive and restorative therapy. Supportive therapy includes debridement and cleansing of wounds, fluids, immunoglobulin, and antimicrobials. Restorative therapy includes definite surgery repair and replenishment of the immune system by use of immunomodulators, growth factors, and bone marrow transplantation. Further studies are needed to examine the usefulness of presently available drugs and experimental agents in the irradiated and traumatized host.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial agent, in comparison with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin (SC-47111; NY-198), a new difluorinated quinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin, amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and trimethoprim against 585 recent clinical isolates and other strains with known mechanisms of resistance. The MICs of lomefloxacin against 90% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci were between 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Neisseria sp. and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml, and streptococci (including Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococci) and Bacteroides fragilis were susceptible to 8 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin was comparable in activity to fleroxacin and ofloxacin, but it was less active than ciprofloxacin. There was cross-resistance between the quinolone group of antimicrobial agents. The protein binding of lomefloxacin was 15.4%, and serum had little effect on the activity of the compound. However, urine at pH 5.0 decreased the activity by two- to eightfold compared with that at pH 7.0
TI  - Comparative study of cefotetan and cefoxitin in the treatment of intra-abdominal  infections.
AB  - One hundred eighty-eight patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare the safety and effectiveness of 1 to 2 gm cefotetan every 12 hours with those of 1 to 2 gm cefoxitin every 6 hours in patients with intra-abdominal infections. Most of the infections were community acquired, were associated with gastrointestinal tract perforation, and were caused by both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The median duration of therapy was 6 days for each group. The clinical response rate for the 95 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group was 98%, and that for the 43 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group was 95%. Bacteriologically, 97% of the 58 evaluable patients in the cefotetan group and 89% of the 27 evaluable patients in the cefoxitin group had a satisfactory or presumed satisfactory response; two patients in the cefotetan group and three in the cefoxitin group were considered bacteriologic failures. Cefotetan was as effective as cefoxitin in eradicating Bacteroides fragilis and other species of Bacteroides, Clostridium sp., and gram-negative bacilli. The incidence of treatment-related adverse reactions for cefotetan (27%) was not statistically different from that for cefoxitin (17%). No clinically significant differences were detected between the treatment groups in changes in the results of clinical laboratory tests performed before and after treatment; a decrease in hematocrit among the cefotetan group was statistically greater (p = 0.04) than that for the cefoxitin group, and a decrease in serum creatinine level for the cefoxitin group was greater than that for the cefotetan group (p = 0.02). Cefotetan may represent an effective, safe, and cost-saving alternative to cefoxitin for the prompt treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. Metronidazole was the most active agent; only Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant. Clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. Beta-lactam antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the Bacteroides fragilis group. At a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of Fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. The highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the B. fragilis group. Within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. We conclude that metronidazole has the most predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.
TI  - The role of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococci and fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (RTI). These organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative and anaerobic bacteria. A recent increase in numbers of bet-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in RTI has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - The in vitro activity of the combination of cefotaxime and HRE 664.
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX) and HRE 664 (a novel penem antibiotic) possess complementary in  vitro properties. Differences can be observed in their antibacterial spectra, their beta-lactamase stability and -inhibition, and their affinity to penicillin-binding proteins. These differences suggested that combinations of the cephalosporin and the penem antibiotic would be advantageous and should be studied. The fractional inhibitory concentration values of checkerboard studies confirmed that CTX and HRE 664 act synergistically against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Fixed combinations containing 80% CTX and 20% HRE 664 possess broader antibacterial spectra and in certain cases higher antibacterial activities than each of the components alone. The combinations had improved activity against Staphylococci including methicillin-resistant strains, beta-lactamase producing strains of Enterobacter sp. and Bacteroides fragilis. The combination as well as the single antibiotics had only limited activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiological studies of tracheostomy site wounds.
AB  - Specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered in 19 (76%). A total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). The most frequently recovered isolates were Peptostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Fusobacterium sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. These included all isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group. The polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Synergistic combinations of antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Studies evaluating the in vitro and in vivo synergistic potential of combined antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria are reviewed. Most studies evaluated therapy against Bacteroides sp. (mostly Bacteroides fragilis group). The combinations found to be most effective against B. fragilis were between metronidazole and clindamycin, spiramycin or gentamicin and between clindamycin and aminoglycosides. Against Bacteroides melaninogenicus the effective combinations were penicillin or clindamycin plus gentamicin and metronidazole and spiramycin or gentamicin. Occasional synergy was observed against Clostridium sp. and anaerobic cocci with clindamycin and gentamicin. Synergistic combinations have the potential of clinical use in serious anaerobic infections.
TI  - Role of anaerobic beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in upper respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis and Bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci and Fusobacterium sp. are important pathogens in upper respiratory tract infections. A recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase-producing strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria in upper respiratory tract infections has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis and lung abscesses. The indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - Microbiology of the female genital tract.
AB  - Patients who contract genital tract infections are predominantly young, are otherwise healthy, and generally respond well to treatment for bacterial infections. These infections are most commonly polymicrobial in etiology, with several noteworthy exceptions. Often there is an inciting event such as childbirth, surgical intervention, pregnancy termination or intrauterine contraceptive device insertion. With treatment, prognosis for cure is excellent; however, sequelae such as recurrent infections, infertility, or ectopic pregnancy can be serious. Bacteria encountered in the female genital tract can be divided into aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Among the aerobic gram-positive organisms, several varieties of streptococci such as Group B streptococci and enterococci occur frequently. Staphylococcus aureus is an infrequent but important pathogen. Among the aerobic gram-negative organisms, the most common is Escherichia coli. Klebsiella sp. and Proteus sp. occur in about 5% of genital tract infections. Species that are more resistant to antibiotics, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter sp., occur in approximately 1% or 2% of these cases and are more likely to appear in patients who have previously received antibiotic therapy or who have been hospitalized for some time. Among the anaerobic organisms, the most common gram-positive isolates are Peptostreptococci and Peptococci. Clostridia sp. occurs less frequently. Among the anaerobic gram-negative organisms, the Bacteroides sp. most frequently encountered are Bacteroides bivius and Bacteroides disiens. Bacteroides fragilis is still a common problem but appears to be less predominant. Other organisms encountered are Chlamydia trachomatis, the genital mycoplasmas, yeasts, protozoa, and viruses.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Bacterial synergy in pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  - Polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora are responsible for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The most frequent pathogens appear to be Neisseria gonorrhoea and anaerobic bacteria (most commonly anaerobic cocci and Bacteroides sp.). Recent studies have demonstrated the recovery of Chlamydia trachomatis in up to a third of these infections. Although N. gonorrhoea is frequently recovered from cervical cultures, it is less commonly recovered from intra-abdominal sites. Recent studies have demonstrated the in-vivo synergistic relationship between N. gonorrhoeae and Bacteroides fragilis. The growth of each component of the mixed infection was enhanced when these were present together in an abscess. Furthermore, the emergence of encapsulated strains was enhanced in these infections. This synergy enables the organisms to cause more severe local and systemic damage to the host. Therapeutic intervention should include the use of antimicrobial agents effective against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of the mixed infection. Unless such therapy is given, the infection may persist. It is also recommended to use antimicrobials that possess synergy between them against the bacterial pathogens. Agents effective against the anaerobic pathogens are metronidazole, clindamycin and cefoxitin. Antimicrobials effective against the Gram-positive aerobic pathogens and N. gonorrhoeae are spiramycin and penicillins. Aminoglycosides or third generation cephalosporins are effective against Gram-negative enterics. The combination of metronidazole and spiramycin has shown to be synergistic against mixed infections of Bacteroides sp. and N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Direct and indirect pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in children.
AB  - Bacteroides sp (Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides oralis, and Bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci, and fusobacteria are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (RTI). These organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. Evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. A recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in RTI has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. These infections include chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. The pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. These direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. The synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. These mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. Both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. However, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. Data, thus far, indicate that there are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed RTI.
TI  - [In vitro studies on microbial incorporation of nitrogen from [15N2] urea and [15N]ammonium chloride by human intestinal flora].
AB  - 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15N2]-urea and [15N]-ammonium chloride. The rates of [15N]-incorporation were calculated. They depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered NPN-substance and on the amount of NPN-substance in the medium. With [15N2]-urea the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (E coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (Bifidobacterium sp.). With [15N]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (Proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (Bifidobacterium sp.). The findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.
TI  - Etiological agent and primary source of infection in 42 cases of focal intracranial suppuration.
AB  - The microbiological findings for 42 patients with focal intracranial suppuration  were analyzed and correlated with the different sources of primary infection. Streptococcus spp. were identified in focal intracranial suppuration of all origins except postcraniotomy. Microaerophilic streptococci were important in cases secondary to respiratory tract infection and in those of unknown origin. Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus spp., and Bacteroides fragilis were the organisms most commonly found in polymicrobial otogenic abscesses. Clostridium sp. was the main microorganism implicated in postcraniotomy suppurations.
TI  - Anaerobic osteomyelitis in children.
AB  - Twenty-six pediatric patients with osteomyelitis caused by anaerobic bacteria are presented. The etiologic factors were chronic mastoiditis (7 patients), decubitus ulcers (5), chronic sinusitis (4), periodontal abscesses (3), bites (3), paronychia (2), trauma (1) and scalp infection after fetal monitoring (1). Seventy-four organisms (2.8 isolates/specimen), including 63 anaerobes (2.4/specimen), and 11 facultative and aerobic bacteria (0.4/specimen) were recovered. The predominant organisms were anaerobic cocci (29 isolates), Bacteroides sp. (21), Fusobacterium sp. (8), Streptococcus sp. (5) and Clostridium sp. (4). The organisms generally reflected the microbial flora of the mucous surface adjacent to the infected site. Ten beta-lactamase-producing organisms were recovered from 7 (27%) patients. These included all isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis (4) and of Staphylococcus aureus (3), 2 of the 12 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group and 1 of 3 Bacteroides oralis. The clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of anaerobic osteomyelitis in children are discussed.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934 compared with that of other new 4-quinolones and  nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone compound, was compared with that of the other new 4-quinolones, enoxacin and ciprofloxacin, and also with that of nalidixic acid. CI-934 was more active than any of the other 4-quinolones tested against Gram-positive aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 0.06-0.25 mg/l), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MICs 0.25-0.5 ml/l), viridans streptococci (MICs 0.06-0.5 mg/l) and most enterococci (MICs 0.12-0.5 mg/l), although some ampicillin-resistant isolates of Str. faecium were slightly less susceptible (MICs 2 mg/l). All three of the newer 4-quinolones tested were highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MICs mostly less than 1 mg/l). The other Gram-negative aerobes tested were in general somewhat less susceptible, although for Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MICs seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. CI-934 was more active than enoxacin against Gardnerella vaginalis (MICs 1-8 mg/l) although it was a little less active than ciprofloxacin. Bacteroides species (including about half of the fragilis group) were susceptible to CI-934 (MICs mostly 1-8 mg/l): ciprofloxacin had similar activity but enoxacin was less active. Other anaerobes tested were mostly highly susceptible to CI-934 (MICs 1 mg/l or less) but were somewhat less susceptible to enoxacin and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - Evidence that polygalacturonic acid may not be a major source of carbon and energy for some colonic Bacteroides species.
AB  - Five Bacteroides species that are found in the human colon can utilize polygalacturonic acid (PGA) when they are grown in laboratory media: Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis subsp. a, and Bacteroides sp. strain 3452A (an unnamed DNA-DNA homology group). PGA-degrading enzymes from B. thetaiotaomicron have been isolated and characterized previously. To determine whether a PGA lyase activity in human feces could be attributed to any of these species, we first determined the properties of PGA lyases from the other four Bacteroides species. PGA lyases from all the Bacteroides species were soluble, cell associated, and inducible by PGA. All had similar pH optima (8.4 to 8.8) and similar molecular weights (50,000). All activities were enhanced by calcium. The PGA lyases from the five species differed with respect to isoelectric point: B. thetaiotaomicron (pI 7.5), B. vulgatus (pI 7.7), B. ovatus (pI 5.8, 7.2), B. fragilis subsp. a (pI 6.1), and Bacteroides sp. strain 3452A (pI 7.7). The PGA lyase activity in human feces resembled those of the Bacteroides PGA lyases in that it had a pH optimum of 8.4 to 8.8 and was enhanced by calcium. However, it differed from the Bacteroides PGA lyases both with respect to isoelectric point (pI 4.2 to 4.4) and molecular weight (100,000). On the basis of these findings, it appears that the PGA lyase activity in human feces is not produced by any of the Bacteroides species surveyed in this survey. Moreover, there was no detectable PGA lyase activity in feces that had the same properties as the Bacteroides enzymes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of roxithromycin: a laboratory evaluation.
AB  - Roxithromycin, formerly known as RU 28965 (9-[O [(2-methoxyethoxy)methyl]oxime]-erythromycin), is a novel 14 atom-membered semisynthetic macrolide with an antibacterial spectrum directed towards Gram-positive cocci and bacilli, Gram-negative cocci and some Parvobacteriaceae. The in vitro antibacterial activity of roxithromycin was compared with those of erythromycin and spiramycin against 275 clinical isolates by using 2-fold broth macro-dilution tests. The antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin and erythromycin were qualitatively comparable (including the bacteriostatic type of activity and the profile of resistance), but minimal inhibitory concentrations of erythromycin were generally one half those of roxithromycin, except for Corynebacterium sp. and Bacteroides fragilis against which the new macrolide was more active. On the other hand, roxithromycin exhibited a superior in vivo antibacterial activity in laboratory animals, being up to six times more potent than erythromycin in curing experimentally infected mice. Roxithromycin showed high blood levels and long half-lives of elimination in rodents after oral administration, and its bioavailability amounted to 72% in mice and 85% in rats, compared to less than 10% for erythromycin. Roxithromycin was widely distributed throughout the body with a high degree of penetration into all tissues, particularly in the lungs.
TI  - Interactions between polymorphonuclear leucocytes, Bacteroides sp, and Escherichia coli: their role in the pathogenesis of mixed infection.
AB  - Five Bacteroides fragilis strains and five Bacteroides vulgatus strains were compared with regard to their ability to consume complement and to fix C3, their killing by polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and their ability to inhibit the bactericidal effect of serum and polymorphs on Escherichia coli strains. Complement consumption was positively related to C3 fixation, but no relation was observed between these variables and the killing of the anaerobes. Greatest inhibition of the killing of E coli by serum and polymorphs was achieved with the bacteroides strains that fixed most complement. The greater virulence of B fragilis in mixed infections with E coli was not reflected either by a greater ability to inhibit the killing of E coli or a greater resistance of the anaerobes themselves to the bactericidal effect of serum and polymorphs.
TI  - DNA probes for identification of clinically important Bacteroides species.
AB  - Conventional procedures for identifying gram-negative anaerobes such as Bacteroides spp. are cumbersome and time-consuming. A simpler approach would be to use DNA probes to identify these organisms. Since many different species of gram-negative anaerobes are isolated from clinical specimens, the most useful DNA probes would be probes that identify a few clinically significant groups of anaerobes. To obtain such probes, we cloned HindIII-digested chromosomal DNA from various Bacteroides species and then screened these probes, labeled with 32P by nick translation, for hybridization to DNA from various species of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and other gram-negative bacteria. We identified three DNA probes (pBFII-4, pBFII-5, and pBFII-6) that hybridized specifically to DNA from Bacteroides fragilis, the species that accounts for about half of all isolates from clinical specimens containing anaerobes. We identified one DNA probe (pBE-3) that hybridized to all members of the B. fragilis group, a group of species that resemble B. fragilis with respect to fermentation pattern and antibiotic resistances. We also identified one probe (pBO-21) that hybridized to DNA from all Bacteroides sp. strains as well as to DNA from strains of Fusobacterium necrophorum and Fusobacterium nucleatum. pBO-21, but not pBE-3, cross-hybridized with a cloned Bacteroides sp. 16S rRNA gene. The limit of detection for these probes was 10(6) bacteria. The probes could detect B. fragilis in blood culture medium and in mixed cultures with other gram-negative bacteria. Attempts to use biotin-labeled DNA probes instead of 32P-labeled probes were not successful because the Bacteroides sp. extracts contained material that bound the streptoavidin-peroxidase detection reagent.
TI  - [Clinical studies on fosfomycin sodium following intravenous administration (tissue concentration and clinical efficacy)].
AB  - Fosfomycin (FOM) is a synthetic antibiotic having a unique structural formula and bactericidal mechanism and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against various bacterial species. It has higher activity in vivo than in vitro. As therapy, FOM-Na in a daily dose of 4 g (2 g X 2) was given by intravenous drip infusion for 5 to 10 days to 6 cases with infectious diseases (2 cases of acute cholecystitis, 3 cases of acute localized peritonitis due to phlegmonous appendicitis and 1 case of acute diffuse peritonitis due to perforative appendicitis). The clinical response was rated as "excellent" in 1 case, "good" in 4 cases, "fair" in 1 case and "poor" in none. No adverse effects were observed in any of the patients. Six clinical isolates were obtained, and these consisted of 4 strains of Escherichia coli and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The MICs of FOM were from 6.25 to 12.5 micrograms/ml for E. coli, 50 micrograms/ml for K. pneumoniae, and 100 micrograms/ml for B. fragilis. FOM-Na was administered to the 6 cases intravenously in a dose of 2 g before surgery, and tissue specimens and body fluid samples were taken during the operation. The FOM concentration was determined by bioassay with a Proteus sp. (MB 838) as the test organism. The mean FOM concentration in bile from the common bile duct was 61.85 +/- 17.13 micrograms/ml (n = 5) at 95 to 108 minutes after FOM-Na intravenous bolus injection. The mean FOM concentration in the gall bladder bile was 80.06 +/- 92.36 micrograms/ml, while that in the gall bladder wall was 146.65 +/- 39.10 micrograms/g. The mean FOM concentration in purulent ascites was 58.20 +/- 13.29 micrograms/ml, 36.22 +/- 14.63 micrograms/g in the appendix wall and 12.64 +/- 11.34 micrograms/ml in pus in the appendix. The FOM concentrations in the infected tissues and body fluids thus exceeded the MICs of FOM for the pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, FOM-Na appears to be a very useful drug when used for chemotherapy of infections encountered in the surgical field.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Serum antibody reactive with predominant organisms in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis.
AB  - In the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (SP). Subjects with SP were often seropositive for Eubacterium brachy, Fusobacterium nucleatum E3C22, and Peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (JP) and subjects with healthy periodontium (HP) were not. Both SP and JP subjects were more frequently seropositive for Bacteroides gingivalis, F. nucleatum D52B16, and F. nucleatum E1D1 than were HP subjects. The data were most striking for B. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for SP and JP subject groups. However, SP subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. In contrast, JP and HP subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. Except at very low levels of antibody, neither SP nor JP groups differed significantly from the HP group for antibody to Eubacterium nodatum, Bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or Lactobacillus minutus antibody. There was a high frequency of antibody to E. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite the fact that this organism is rarely found in HP subjects. For Eubacterium timidum, the JP group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the HP group. Despite high levels of L. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 SP subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the HP and JP subjects had detectable antibody. These results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. B. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. However, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., L. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.
TI  - Mutagenic activation of biliary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene by intestinal microflora.
AB  - To investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from Fischer rats treated per os with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. A mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of Salmonella typhimurium tester strains TA98 or TA100. Bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-NP) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain TA98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. There was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. Treatment of 1-NP-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced its mutagenicity. Cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 12044, B. vulgatus ATCC 8482, B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 12290, Bacteroides sp. strain 524, Eubacterium eligens VPI C15-48, Peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and Escherichia coli A-5-18) also enhanced the mutagenicity of 1-NP-bile. These bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-D-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. These data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-NP-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic aglycone(s).
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic tonsillitis in young adults.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 22 young adults (mean age, 23 years) suffering from chronic tonsillitis. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained from core tonsillar cultures in all patients, yielding an average of 9.0 isolates (5.3 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium sp, and gram-positive cocci. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and hemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase-production was noted in 32 isolates recovered from 18 tonsils (82%). These included all eight isolates of S aureus and five B fragilis, and 11 of 24 B melaninogenicus group (46%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep tonsillar flora in young adults with chronic tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in most of the patients.
TI  - Infection and the use of antibiotics in Crohn's disease.
AB  - Many patients with Crohn's disease present with the complications of infection. Hence, antibiotics play an important role in the medical management of acute inflammatory disease, persistent perianal disease and as prophylaxis for surgical operations. The author's group has demonstrated that bacteria colonize the serosa of the bowel in patients with Crohn's disease in 27% of cases. Furthermore, pathogenic bacteria could be recovered from the lymph nodes in 33% of patients with Crohn's disease, compared with only 5% in a controlled population. Extraintestinal bacterial colonization was, therefore, present in approximately half of all patients requiring an operation for Crohn's disease. The principal bacteria isolated at these sites were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Proteus sp and diphtheroids. A prospective controlled trial on the use of 1 month's antimicrobial therapy in patients with relapse of Crohn's disease revealed that metronidazole was associated with a 57% response rate, compared with a response of only 17% in patients receiving no metronidazole. These interim findings suggest that metronidazole may have a role in the management of acute relapse in patients with Crohn's disease.
TI  - [In vitro activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on anaerobic bacteria. Comparison with amoxicillin, lamoxactam and metronidazole].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the combination amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AAC) (2/1 w/w) on 84 strains of obligate anaerobes were measured by the agar diffusion method and compared to those of amoxicillin (AMO), lamoxactam (LAM) and metronidazole (MET). For the 47 Bacteroides fragilis strains tested, the mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml with AAC, 1-2 with MET, 0.5-1 with LAM and 8-16 with AMO. A similar range of activity was found on the 16 other strains of Bacteroides sp.. AAC and AMO have a comparable activity on Clostridium perfringens (mode MIC 0.016-0.032 microgram/ml), superior to that of LAM (mode MIC 0.125) and MET (mode MIC 0.5). AAC and AMO have an almost identical activity on Peptococci and Peptostreptococci, the MIC for both drugs being less than 0.125 microgram/ml. A similar activity was found for LAM and MET.
TI  - beta-Lactamase-producing bacteria recovered after clinical failures with various  penicillin therapy.
AB  - The presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in clinical specimens was investigated in 185 children with orofacial or respiratory tract infections. All of these patients failed to respond to antimicrobial therapy, including penicillins, that was administered to 148 (80%) of them. beta-Lactamase-producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were detected in 75 (40.5%) of the 185 children. The beta-lactamase-producing strains included all 11 strains of the Bacteroides fragilis group, 30 (45.4%) of the 66 strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, five (41.7%) of the 12 strains of Bacteroides oralis, and 41 (97.6%) of 42 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. All beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides strains were resistant to penicillin as compared with the non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. Clinical cure was achieved after surgical drainage and a change in antimicrobial therapy in most of the patients. In treatment of orofacial and respiratory tract infections, the clinician should consider the presence of beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides sp and S aureus as a possible cause of clinical failure with various penicillin therapies.
TI  - Trends in the development of beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - In many ways it is ironic that the first description of a beta-lactamase occurred in 1940 with an enzyme isolated from Escherichia coli since in recent years there has been a major interest in Gram-negative species and the development of agents to overcome the hydrolytic action of beta-lactamases of Gram-negative species. There have been four distinctly different approaches to the development of new beta-lactam antibiotics. These have been the search for inhibitors of beta-lactamases and agents such as clavulanic acid and sulbactam are examples of compounds which by virtue of Kcat function act as suicide inhibitors and make old antibiotics new. There has been the modification of the penicillin and cephem nucleus to increase beta-lactamase stability or failing that to improve the ability of the compounds to pass through the cell wall and increase affinity for critical beta-lactam receptors, i.e. penicillin-binding proteins. There has been the development of carbapenem type of agents such as imipenem which would have broad activity including aerobic, anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. There has been the discovery of the monobactam agents of which aztreonam is an example of a compound with great beta-lactamase stability but with activity limited to Gram-negative aerobic species. Bacterial resistance has indeed been the major factor that has modified use of beta-lactams and influenced the development of the aforementioned types of drugs. The widespread presence of beta-lactamases in common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis has made it necessary to have beta-lactamase stable compounds for initial therapy of infection. It is possible to analyze structure-activity relations of beta-lactam compounds to determine changes which will be most advantageous in light of known and expected resistance patterns. But the increased realization in recent years of the importance of the pharmacokinetics of beta-lactam drugs has made it essential that the development of new compounds be based on an integration of microbiological and pharmacokinetic parameters. Interest in the prevention of resistant flora has also affected the development of new drugs since it is increasingly appreciated that alteration of intestinal flora contributes to selection of drug resistant microorganisms. Finally, new toxicities or adverse effects associated with the use of certain new agents has modified the development of certain compounds.
TI  - The effect of lincomycin-neomycin treatment on experimental anaerobic bacterial bovine mastitis.
AB  - Three healthy lactating quarters of a Friesland cow were each experimentally infected with a pure culture of a strain of either Bacteroides fragilis, Eubacterium lentum or a Peptostreptococcus sp. respectively. The onset and progression to clinical mastitis was monitored 12 hourly by examination for clinical signs of inflammation, bacterial culture, somatic cell counts and with a strip cup. All infected quarters developed clinical mastitis within 24 hours. The 2 quarters infected with B. fragilis and E. lentum respectively were treated 4 times consecutively at 12 hour intervals, commencing at 24 h by intramammary instillation of 10 ml of a mixture containing 200 mg lincomycin hydrochloride, 200 mg neomycin sulphate and 5 mg methylprednisolone (Lincocin Forte, Upjohn). Both quarters became clinically normal and no bacteria could be detected in the secretions 12 hours after the first treatment. At 36 hours the strip cup became negative, and the somatic cell count dropped to less than 500 X 10(3) at 72 hours after the initial treatment. The quarter infected with a Peptostreptococcus sp. was unable to overcome the infection by natural means when intramammary treatment was delayed for the first 36 hours after the onset of clinical mastitis. Subsequent treatment of this quarter gave results similar to those treated earlier.
TI  - Alpha-ketoglutarate metabolism by cytochrome-containing anaerobes.
AB  - During growth in the presence of tracer amounts of exogenously supplied alpha-keto[1-14C]glutarate (AKG) or alpha-keto [5-14C]glutarate, cytochrome-containing Bacteroides fragilis strain 2044 and Bacteroides vulgatus strain 8482 incorporated extremely small amounts of radioactivity into cell macromolecules and protoheme. Under identical conditions, Bacteroides "l" strain 7CM and Bacteroides buccae strain J1 incorporated substantial label from [5-14C]AKG, but not [1-14C]AKG, into cellular macromolecules and protoheme. Bacteroides succinogenes strain S85 incorporated radioactivity from both [1-14C]AKG and [5-14C]AKG into cell macromolecules, but only label from [5-14C]AKG appeared in protoheme. Selenomonas ruminantium strain HD1 and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain D1, both of which are devoid of cytochromes, incorporated substantial label from both [1-14C]AKG and [5-14C]AKG into cell macromolecules, but failed to incorporate label from either position into protoheme. Bacteroides ruminicola sp. brevis strain GA33 incorporated label from both [1-14C]AKG and [5-14C]AKG into both cell macromolecules and protoheme. A substantial portion of the heme synthesized by this organism may be formed by the "plant" pathway involving the intact use of the AKG carbon skeleton. Major differences exist in the manner and extent of AKG utilization among cytochrome-containing anaerobes and between these organisms and bacteria devoid of cytochromes obtained from similar environments.
TI  - The frequency and some characteristics of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various forms of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The prevalence of strictly anaerobic bacteria in the secretions from untreated cases of mastitis in lactating dairy cows was investigated. The study involved 147 Friesland cows in 12 highveld herds. All herds yielded cows with anaerobic udder infections. No anaerobic bacteria were recovered from cows with normal quarters or those with latent aerobic infections. Only anaerobes were present in 10% of so-called 'aseptic' mastitis cases. A variety of anaerobic organisms was isolated concurrently with facultative bacteria from 5,3% and 58,8% of cases classified as subclinical and clinical respectively. Peptococcus spp. was associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and Bacteroides spp. with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus agalactiae in 80% anaerobic udder infections. Gram positive anaerobic species were mostly sensitive to penicillin-G but all the Gram negative rods were resistant. In addition, all B. fragilis strains produced beta-lactamase. The ability to produce heparinase was demonstrated in one strain of Peptococcus indolicus and a Peptostreptococcus sp.
TI  - Thiotetromycin, a new antibiotic. Taxonomy, production, isolation, and physicochemical and biological properties.
AB  - A new antibiotic, thiotetromycin, has been isolated from the culture filtrate of  Streptomyces sp. OM-674 by solvent extraction and silica gel chromatography. The molecular formula of the antibiotic has been determined as C13H18O2S on the basis of elemental analysis and its high resolution mass spectrometry. The antibiotic contains a thiotetronic acid in the molecule and possesses a selective activity against Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 230 clinical isolates, including 55 anaerobic bacteria, was tested with ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, moxalactam, cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Ceftazidime was the most active drug against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter sp. Against Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were similar to cefotaxime, moxalactam, and cefoperazone and more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin. Cefoxitin and moxalactam were significantly more active against Bacteroides fragilis than were the other beta-lactam drugs. Against Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone showed moderate activity, while ceftazidime was relatively inactive. These results indicate a potential role for ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against infections involving facultative and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefotiam in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - It was known that antibacterial spectrum and activity of CTM were superior to those of other cephalosporins. Basic and clinical studies in the field of obstetrics and gynecology on CTM were carried out. The results were summarized as follows. 1. Bacteriologically, the MIC of CTM against E. coli was less than 0.39 mcg/ml with an inoculum size of 10(6) CFU/ml. The 50% of Bacteroides sp. were inhibited by CTM at a concentration of 25 mcg/ml or less. 2. CTM was more stable against beta-lactamase extracted from B. fragilis than CEZ or cefpiramide. 3. After administration by the drip infusion of 1 g or 2 g to 5 cases, distribution of CTM to intrapelvic organs was measured. The results were relatively favourable. The concentration in the tissues was sufficient to inhibit clinical isolates such as E. coli and K. pneumoniae in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. 4. CTM was administered to 6 cases of various infections, and clinical response was excellent in 2 cases and good in 4 cases. No side effect nor adverse reaction of CTM was observed. Consequently CTM was considered to be one of useful antibiotics.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - 6-Acetylmethylenepenicillanic acid (Ro 15-1903), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. II. Antibacterial properties.
AB  - The beta-lactamase inhibitor Ro 15-1903 showed low affinity for penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) of Escherichia coli. When used as a single compound, it displayed no substantial antibacterial activity but in combination with ampicillin, it was similar to clavulanic acid in conferring activity against ampicillin-resistant strains. Some synergy between Ro 15-1903 and piperacillin was found against high inocula of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ro 15-1903 markedly enhanced the activity of ceftriaxone against Bacteroides fragilis. In keeping with the in vitro findings, the combination Ro 15-1903 and ampicillin protected mice against systemic infections with beta-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp. but not against those with Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and E. coli producing either chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of type I or plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase of type TEM.
TI  - Piperacillin sodium: antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and adverse reactions.
AB  - Piperacillin sodium is a beta lactam antibiotic with a broad range of antibacterial activity that includes gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci (except penicillinase-producing S. aureus) and anaerobic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis. Piperacillin inhibits many of the members of the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella sp and Pseudomonas, at lower concentrations than required for carbenicillin and ticarcillin. Piperacillin sodium is administered by intramuscular and intravenous injection and is widely distributed throughout body fluids and tissues. Like other newer penicillins, piperacillin is excreted by both renal and biliary mechanisms. The primary route of elimination is by glomerular filtration, which results in high urinary concentrations of the unchanged compound. Piperacillin has been approved for patients with serious infection caused by susceptible strains of specific organisms in intra-abdominal, urinary tract, gynecologic, lower respiratory tract, skin and skin structure, bone and joint, and gonococcal infections and septicemia. As with other penicillins, piperacillin has a low frequency of toxicity. The usual dose of piperacillin in adults with serious infections with normal renal function is 3-4 g every 4-6 hr as a 20-30 min infusion, with a maximum dose of 24 g per day. It is stable in most large volume parenteral solutions. Less serious infectins (requiring smaller dosages) may be treated by intramuscular injection; however, no more than 2 g should be given at any one injection site. Overall, piperacillin has a greater degree of activity than other penicillins. Evidence from prospective studies indicates that piperacillin is a highly effective agent for the treatment of patients with infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - [Timed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefmetazole against selected gram-negative bacteria].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of cefmetazole, a new preparation of cephamycin antibiotic, were determined against selected clinical strains of Escherichia coli (27 strains), Klebsiella sp. (27 strains) and Bacteroides fragilis (27 strains). Activities were evaluated at bacteriostatic and also bactericidal levels with particular reference to time of exposure of microbes to the drug. The minimal drug concentrations producing minimal reduction of colony-forming units at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug--approximations to the theoretical bacteriostatic concentrations--were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h MRCs, respectively. Conventional MIC yielding no turbidity after incubation of antibiotic-containing broth for 24 hours was also determined. The minimal concentrations of the drug producing 99.9% killing at time intervals of 3, 6 and 24 hours after exposure to the drug were designated as 3-h, 6-h and 24-h MLCs, respectively. Assuming that the apparent mode of action of a drug is bactericidal when the ratio of bactericidal-bacteriostatic concentrations is low (less than or equal to 4) and bacteriostatic when high (greater than or equal to 8), then cefmetazole appeared to be a bactericidal drug to a considerable number of Gram-negative strains when the exposure time exceeded a period of 6 hours. The data that the mode of action of this drug is bactericidal with such relatively brief exposure times--indicating rapid decrease of colony-forming units--would suggest cefmetazole is an excellent antibacterial agent and would be a useful drug in treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Methane and hydrogen production by human intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The gas above liquid cultures of a variety of human intestinal anaerobic bacteria was sampled and analysed by headspace gas chromatography. Hydrogen production was greatest with strains of the genus Clostridium, intermediate with anaerobic cocci and least with Bacteroides sp. Very few strains produced methane although small amounts were detected with one strain of B. thetaiotaomicron, C. perfringens and C. histolyticum. There may be a relationship between these anaerobic bacteria and several gastrointestinal disorders in which there is a build up of hydrogen or methane in the intestines.
TI  - Bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities.
AB  - Eleven cases of bacteremia in diabetic patients with infected lower extremities at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital (RLAH) were observed over a 34-mo period. The yearly incidence was 0.6% of admissions to the Ortho-Diabetes service. Aerobic bacteria were recovered in six cases and anaerobic bacteria in five. Bacteroides fragilis was isolated four times, Staphylococcus aureus three times, and nonfragilis Bacteroides sp., Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and viridans streptococcus were each seen once. Ten of the 11 patients were febrile at the time of bacteremia. Clinical, laboratory, radiologic, and ultrasonographic parameters were comparable in patients with aerobic and anaerobic bacteremia, and between bacteremic patients and nonbacteremic controls. Fever, however, was significantly more frequent in bacteremic patients. Foul-smelling lesions were seen in two of the five patients with anaerobic bacteremia, and in none of the patients with aerobic bacteremia. Postoperative B. fragilis bacteremia was observed to be transient and resolved without definitive therapy in one patient. Appropriate antibiotic therapy in 10 patients together with surgical intervention in eight cases resulted in resolution of the infection in the remaining patients.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - The upper vaginal and cervical anaerobic flora in menopausal women.
AB  - The upper vaginal and cervical bacterial flora, especially the anaerobic one which has a particular role in postoperative morbidity, was studied in 78 menopausal women between 48 and 78 yr of age. The aim of the present study was to compare the results obtained with those reported for bacterial flora in women of other age groups. The patients were divided into the following 3 groups. (I) Twenty-eight healthy women with a natural menopause; (II) 30 women, 2-6 mth after surgical menopause due to panhysterectomy; and (III) 20 menopausal women 3 mth after vaginal hysterectomy. 30.7% of the cultures were found to be sterile. The anaerobic bacteria, developed only in the presence of aerobic germs, represented 11.5% of the total number of cultures and was found to be formed by Streptococcus bacteroides sp. and Bacteroides fragilis. The vaginal flora of menopausal women is not different from that found in children, young women, in pregnancy or postpartum. The anaerobic germs isolated in our study are normal inhabitants of the vagina and cervix which may occasionally become pathogens.
TI  - [Anerobic infections in otolaryngology (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies have shown, that the normal flora of the upper airway harbors many different anaerobic bacteria. They play an important role in many chronic diseases such as chronic sinusitis, chronic secretory otitis and chronic tonsillitis. On the other hand they may cause acute situations such as pharyngeal abscess, Ludwig's angina, Vincent's angina or space infections in the neck. The bacteria most frequently reported from infected sites are Bacteroides sp., anaerobic cocci and fuso-bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis plays a minor role. Anaerobic pathogens should also be considered in patients with major surgery of the head and neck following radiation therapy. This concept leads to a considerable reduction of major and minor surgical complications.
TI  - Isolation and significance of anaerobic bacteria isolated from cases of bovine mastitis.
AB  - The role of obligate anaerobic bacteria in the aetiology of mastitis of lactating dairy cows was investigated. Anaerobes were isolated from 12% of lactating mastitic cows, which were representative of 50% of the 10 dairy herds examined. Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently isolated organism of (50%), followed by Peptococcus indolicus (33%), Eubacterium lentum (33%), E. aerofaciens (17%), Propionibacterium granulosum (17%) and an anaerobic Streptococcus sp. (17%). These obligate anaerobes were always isolated together with organisms classically involved in mastitis. It was possible to induce overt clinical mastitis in healthy lactating udders within 24 hours by infection with single pure cultures of anaerobes via the teat canal. All B. fragilis strains were resistant to penicillin G and tetracycline. In addition, one strain was also resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin and amoxicillin. Anaerobic gram positive cocci and bacilli were sensitive to most antibiotics. These findings imply an important role for anaerobes in the aetiology of mastitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cutaneous abscesses in children.
AB  - Specimens from 209 cutaneous abscesses in children were cultured for aerobic and  anaerobic microorganisms. Of these, nine (4%) were sterile and 51 (24%) yielded pure cultures that were predominantly Staphylococcus aureus. The rest of the abscesses yielded growth of two or more aerobic and/or anaerobic organisms. The data were organized according to these anatomic locations: head, neck, trunk, finger, nailbed, hand, leg, buttocks, perirectal, and vulvovaginal areas. Aerobic bacteria only were present in 92 specimens (46%), anaerobes only were isolated in 52 (26%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 56 abscesses (28%). A total of 467 isolates (270 anaerobes and 197 aerobes) were recovered, accounting for 2.3 isolates per specimen (1.3 anaerobes and 1.0 aerobes). The presence of more than one anaerobe per abscess was obtained from the vulvo-vaginal, buttocks, perirectal, finger, nailbed, and head areas. Aerobes were more prevalent in the neck, hand, leg, and trunk areas. The predominant aerobes recovered were: S aureus (89 isolates), alpha- and nonhemolytic streptococci (29), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (16), Enterobacter (10), and Escherichia coli (8). The predominant anaerobes recovered were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (79 isolates), Bacteroides sp (116, including 31 B melaninogenicus group and 29 B fragilis group), and Fusobacterium sp (39). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cutaneous abscesses in children in perirectal, head, finger, and nailbed areas.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burns in children.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of burn sites in 180 children were monitored. Specimens were obtained twice a week; each patient had between one and 21 cultures taken (mean 2.4). A total of 392 specimens were collected over 2 years, of which 319 were positive. Aerobic bacteria alone were present in 225 specimens (71%) and anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 26 (8%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in 68 burn specimens (21%). A total of 580 isolates (448 aerobes and 132 anaerobes) were recovered, accounting for 1.8 isolates per specimen (1.4 aerobes and 0.4 anaerobes). The predominant aerobic isolates were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, alpha hemolytic streptococcus, Pseudomonas sp., and Group D streptococcus. The predominant anaerobic isolates were: P. acnes, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Bacteroides sp. Blood cultures were drawn from 45 children: four showed bacterial growth of one of each of the following isolates: S. aureus, E. coli, Peptococcus asaccharolyticus, and B. fragilis. The numbers of isolates per specimen were higher in the oral and anal area (3.2 and 2.8) than in the extremities and trunk (1.8 and 0.9). Gram-negative enteric rods and Group D streptococci were more frequently recovered from the anal area. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. acnes were more frequently recovered from extremities. Bacteroides sp. and Fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently recovered from the anal and oral areas. All children were treated with local application of silver sulfadiazine, and antimicrobial therapy was used in 128 children. Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the bacteria isolated and use of antimicrobial agents. These data suggest a role for anaerobic bacteria in the colonization of burns in children, especially in burns of the anal and oral areas.
TI  - Bacteriology of intracranial abscess in children.
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical findings in 19 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Ten children presented with subdural empyema and nine had brain abscess. Sinusitis was present in 14 children, and dental abscess in two. The abscess was located in the frontal and parietal area in seven instances each, and in the temporal area in five. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 12 (63%) of the patients (including eight with subdural empyema and four with brain abscess), aerobic bacteria alone were present in two children (11%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in five (26%) patients. There were 43 anaerobic isolates (2.3 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (16 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (10, including two B. fragilis); Fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and Actinomyces sp. (five isolates). A total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five Gram-positive cocci and three Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Five patients, four with sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  - Adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (Group A) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (Group B). Patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. The adenoids were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. There were 97 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates in both groups were: Bacteroides sp. (including B. melaninogenicus and B. oralis), Fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and Veillonella sp. There were 138 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (Group A, B, C, and F), S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Hemophilus sp. Hemophilus influenzae type B, and S. aureus were more frequently isolated in Group A. B. fragilis was only recovered in Group A. Beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. Fifteen of these patients belonged to Group A (83% of Group A), while 3 were members of Group B (25% of Group B). These bacteria were all isolates of S. aureus (11) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 B. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 B. oralis, and two of 8 H. influenza type B. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
AB  - Cholesteatoma specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. All specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Bacterial growth was present in specimens of 24 of the 28 patients. A total of 74 bacterial isolates were present (40 aerobes and 34 anaerobes). Aerobes alone were isolated from 8 (33%) of culture positive patients, 4 patients (26.7%) yielded only anaerobes, and 12 (50%) had both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Fifty isolates (27 aerobes and 23 aerobes) were present in a concentration greater than 10(6) CFU/gm. The most commonly isolated aerobic organisms were P. aeruginosa (9), Proteus sp. (7), K. pneumoniae (5), S. aureus (5), and E. coli (4). The anaerobic bacteria most commonly isolated were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (12), Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 B. fragilis group), Clostridium sp. (3), and Bifidobacterium sp. (3). The above findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of cholesteatoma.
TI  - The treatment of the carrier state of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci with clindamycin.
AB  - 20 children who were chronic carriers of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were treated with oral clindamycin. Surface tonsillar cultures were obtained prior to therapy and 2 weeks after termination of therapy. They were processed for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all cultures. Prior to therapy, the average yield was 9 isolates (5 aerobes and 4.1 anaerobes) per specimen; after completion of therapy, the average yield was 5.7 isolates (3 aerobes and 2.7 anaerobes). GABHS, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Bacteroides oralis were completely eliminated after clindamycin therapy and the number of isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Fusobacterium sp. was reduced. Beta lactamase production was detected prior to therapy in 21 isolates recovered from 16 tonsillar surfaces (80%). These included all isolates of S. aureus (8) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 18 B. melaninogenicus (44%), and 3 of 5 B. oralis (60%). Only one isolate of beta-lactamase-producing strain of B. melaninogenicus was recovered after conclusion of therapy. Follow-up of the patients for 18 - 24 months (average 22 months) showed no recurrence of GABHS in 19 of the 20 children.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteremia in children.
AB  - Twenty-nine anaerobic isolates were recovered from 28 pediatric patients with anaerobic bacteremia: 14 Bacteroides sp (11 in the B fragilis group); four anaerobic Gram-positive cocci; four Clostridium sp; four Propionibacterium acnes; and three Fusobacterium sp. No aerobic bacteria were isolated from these patients. The gastrointestinal tract was the possible portal of entry in 13 instances, eight of which were due to Bacteroides organisms, four to Clostridium sp, and one to F nucleatum. The ear, sinus, and oropharynx were probable portals of entry in seven instances, four of which were due to Peptococcus sp and two to Fusobacterium sp. Five patients (18%) died; four had bacteremia caused by B fragilis group, and one had bacteremia caused by P acnes. The average duration of antimicrobial therapy was 20 days (range, seven to 72 days). The early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of utmost importance in improving the outcome of these patients.
TI  - Bacterial studies of peritoneal cavity and postoperative surgical wound drainage  following perforated appendix in children.
AB  - This study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. Additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. Bacterial growth occurred in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. Anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. There were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). The predominant isolates were: E. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); Group D streptococcus (12 specimens); and P. aeruginosa (9 specimens). There were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). The predominant isolates were: 157 Bacteroides spp. (including 92 B. fragilis group and 26 B. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 Peptococcus sp.; 29 Peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 Fusobactenium sp.; and 16 Clostridium sp. B. fragilis and Peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. Beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. These included all isolates of B. fragilis and six of the 23 Bacteroides sp. Forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. The predominant organisms were: B. fragilis (8 specimens); E. coli (6 specimens); Peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of P. aeruginosa and Peptococcus sp. Most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of perirectal abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from perirectal abscesses in 28 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 87 isolates (64 anaerobic and 23 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, an average of 2.3 anaerobes and 0.8 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered from 15 specimens (54%), and in nine specimens (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. Aerobic organisms were recovered in pure culture in only four patients (14%). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (32 isolates, including 14 B fragilis group and seven B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (15), Fusobacterium sp (six), and Clostridium sp (three). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (six of each), group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus morganii (two of each). Five children had a serious underlying chronic disease; three of these had an accompanying bacteremia and two died. Incision and drainage were performed on all patients: some children also received parenteral, or oral antibiotic treatment, or both.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscess in children.
AB  - Aspirates of pus from pilonidal abscesses in 25 children were studied for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 76 isolates (63 anaerobic and 13 aerobic) were recovered from the patients, accounting for 2.52 anaerobes and 0.52 aerobes per specimen. Anaerobic organisms were recovered from all the specimens, and in eight cases (32%) they were mixed with aerobic organisms. The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides sp (36 isolates, including ten B fragilis group and ten B melaninogenicus group), Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (16). Fusobacterium sp (five), and Clostridium sp (four). The predominant aerobic organisms were Escherichia coli (four) and group D streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and Proteus sp (two of each). We believe this study is the first to demonstrate the mixed anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology of pilonidal cyst abscesses in children.
TI  - Beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Bacteroides species from children.
AB  - Two hundred twenty-four isolates of Bacteroides sp. were recovered from recurrently inflamed tonsils, infected peritoneal fluid, abscesses, wounds, and burns of hospitalized children. Isolates were examined for beta-lactamase production by the chromogenic cephalosporin analog 87/312 methodology. Altogether, 119 isolates were beta-lactamase producers. Of these, 53 were in the B. fragilis group, 28 were in the B. melaninogenicus groups, 12 were B. oralis, 4 were B. ruminicola subsp. brevis, and 22 were Bacteroides sp. Of 28 beta-lactamase-producing strains of B. melaninogenicus, 25 were recovered from tonsils. These observations indicate that in pediatric patients there is a significant incidence of beta-lactamase producers among anaerobes other than B. fragilis.
TI  - The identification of gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolated from clinical infections.
AB  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli isolated from specimens submitted to the routine  diagnostic bacteriology laboratory and regarded as significant pathogens were identified by conventional bacteriological tests; 399 strains isolated from 356 specimens submitted from 332 patients were studied and most were readily identified by the results of a combined set of morphological, biochemical, tolerance and antibiotic disk resistance tests; B. fragilis has particular pathogenic potential and was the commonest species isolated, accounting for greater than 50% of strains. The next commonest was B. asaccharolyticus with 55 strains, and 16 other species or groups were represented by smaller numbers. Many (68%) were from infections related to the gastro-intestinal tract, but there were significant numbers from infections of the male and female genito-urinary tracts, the head, neck and central nervous system and from a variety of soft tissue infections. Most infections were mixed, and a pure culture of a Bacteroides sp. was obtained from only 26% of infections; two or more strains of Bacteroides were recovered from 55 infections. The specific identification of Bacteroides may help the bacteriologist to judge the significance of laboratory findings, influence the patient's management and prognosis and help determine the source of infection.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - The activity of LY127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacteroides fragilis. The strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. LY127935 exhibited striking activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., Serratia marcescens, and B. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was somewhat less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus. Cefotaxime (HR 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against B. fragilis. LY127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Activity of semisynthetic penicillins and synergism with mecillinam against Bacteroides species.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of six penicillins (ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, and Bay k 4999) against 29 clinical isolates of Bacteriodes spp. (including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and Bacteroides vulgatus) were determined by an agar dilution method. Bay k 4999 was most active, followed in descending order by ampicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, ticarcillin, and carbenicillin. Mecillinam, a 6 beta-amidino-penicillanic acid, inhibited no strains at 50 micrograms/ml, but when compared with ampicillin, a fourfold or greater increase in MIC for ampicillin (antagonism) was noted in 3 of 29 strains, with no effect on MIC for 26 strains, whereas when combined with carbenicillin, a fourfold or greater decrease in MIC for both antibiotics (synergism) was noted in 12 strains, 4 of which had an MIC of greater than or equal to 250 micrograms/ml for carbenicillin alone. These studies demonstrate the increased activity of some newer semisynthetic penicillins and the potential synergy obtained with mecillinam and carbenicillin against Bacteroides sp.
TI  - Bacteriology and treatment of chronic otitis media.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 50 patients with chronic otitis media. Pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes only were isolated from 21 patients, 3 had only anaerobes (peptococcus sp.) and 26 had both aerobes and anaerobes. There were 68 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 36 (72%). Other aerobes commonly recovered included proteus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 48 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobic gram positive cocci were isolated in 24 instances. Sixteen Bacteriodes sp. were recovered, including 7 B. fragilis and 6 B. melaninogenicus. The patients were divided into two groups according to their antimicrobial therapy: 28 received carbenicillin and 22 clindamycin. An aminoglycoside was added when aerobic enteric gram negative rods were present in significantly high numbers in the culture. There was good to excellent response to therapy in more than half of the patients and in 12% there was a remission from symptoms for up to one year. Thirty-six percent of the patients had no response to therapy. There were no statistical differences in response to therapy in the two groups treated. Antimicrobial therapy directed against aerobic and anaerobic isolates from chronic otitis media had a high success rate in complete eradication of the infection.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Bacteroides infections by indirect immunofluorescence assay of clinical specimens.
AB  - 43 specimens from a variety of sites were directly examined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (I.F.A.) with specific antisera against the capsular polysaccharide of Bacteroides fragilis and pooled antisera against a number of serotypes of Bacteroides sp. (all of the former B. fragilis subspecies). The findings were compared with those of routine anaerobic bacteriology and gas liquid chromatography for short chain fatty acids. Examination by I.F.A. was a sensitive (100%) and specific (90.3%) means of identifying B. fragilis. Use of the pooled serum was sensitive (100%) but less specific (64.3%) than the capsular antiserum (90.3%) although it had the advantage of detecting Bacteroides species other than B. fragilis. The capsular serum I.F.A. gave 9.7% false positives and no false negatives. The predictive value of a positive identification of B. fragilis in a clinical specimen using this anticapsular serum I.F.A. test was 80%; with the pooled Bacteroides group-serum it was 60%. The predictive value of a negative test was 100% for both sera, indicating that a negative I.F.A. test is a reliable index of the absence of Bacteroides from the culture I.F.A. of clinical material provides a rapid (less than 2 h) specific and sensitive means for the diagnosis of B. fragilis infections and would be of use in a clinical laboratory.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic otitis media.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 50 patients with chronic otitis media; pus was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Only aerobes were isolated from 21 patients (42%), three patients had only anaerobes (Peptococcus sp), and 25 patients (50%) had both aerobes and anaerobes. Only one specimen had no growth. There were 68 aerobic isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered in 36 patients (72%); other aerobes commonly recovered included Proteus sp and Staphylococcus aureus. There were 48 anaerobes isolated. Anaerobic Gram-positive cocci were isolated in 24 instances (21 Peptococcus sp and three Peptostreptococcus sp). Sixteen Bacteroides sp were recovered, including seven B fragilis group and six B melaninogenicus.
TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - Quantitative microflora of the vagina.
AB  - This study enumerated the predominant vaginal flora in 25 healthy patients: 18 prenatal (six with and 12 without gonorrhea) and seven nonpregnant without gonorrhea. All 25 patients had aerobes and 19 of the 25 had anerobes isolated in titers of greater than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU per milliliter). The most frequently isolated microorganism was the lactobacillus (aerobic and anaerobic species) followed by C. vaginale, viridans streptococci, anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and Bifidobacterium sp. Bacteroides fragilis was not isolated. There were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation of any specific microorganism or bacterial counts between pregnant and nonpregnant women or between pregnant women with and without gonorrhea (p greater than 0.05), except pregnant patients had significantly higher total facultative counts associated with significantly lower anaerobic lactobacilli counts and higher C. vaginale counts (p less than 0.01) than in nonpregnant patients.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Tryptophanase of fecal flora as a possible factor in the etiology of colon cancer.
AB  - Twenty-three strains of intestinal anaerobes obtained from two laboratories were  examined for indole production from tryptophan. Among the 23 isolates tested, three of Bacteroides fragilis thetaiotaomicron and one Citrobacter sp. were indole positive. The tryptophanase of the indole-positive strains of intestinal anaerobes was inducible by tryptophan and was susceptible to glucose repression. The products of tryptophanase activity were formed in stoichiometric amounts by dialyzed, freshly prepared extracts. The tryptophan concentration and tryptophanase activity in feces from rats on an all-meat diet were significantly higher than those in feces from rats on a normal diet. The results indicated that the higher tryptophanase activity in the feces of rats fed an all-meat diet is due to the inducibility of this enzyme by tryptophan and is not due to any inhibitor in the feces of rats on a normal diet. The results also suggested that a population with a diet rich in meat has a greater chance for exposure to possible carcinogens such as indole and other tryptophan metabolites. This agrees with the hypothesis, based on epidemiologic data, that a high intake of meat may be related to the development of colon cancer in man.
TI  - [A new butyric acid-producing bacteroides species: B. splanchnicus n. sp. (author's transl)].
AB  - Three butyric acid-producing saccharolytic Bacteroides cultures (1651/6, BM 158,  and IPP 3751) were described by WERNER and REICHERTZ in 1971 (Zbl.Bakt.Hyg., I. Abt. Orig. A 217,206-216). Since then, 6 strains closely resembling 1651/6 were isolated from stool specimens and surgically removed appendices. In the present communication, strains 1651/6, S2/34, S3/38, S4/28, S6/6, A5/2 are described as members of a new species, Bacteroides splanchnicus n.sp. The strains were morphologically very similar (Gram negative non-sporing non-motile rods, 1-2.5 mu in length and 0.7 mu in width) and fermented glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, lactose, and arabinose (pH values of 4.6-5.4, moderate gas formation). Negative reactions (pH values of 5.8-7.2) were observed with 20 other carbohydrates. The strains were positive in the glutamic acid decarboxylase test and formed indole and H2S. In peptone-yeast extract broth and peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth acetic, propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric acids were produced. Washed cells of strains 1651/6 and S4/28 incubated anaerobically in sterile solutions of single amino acids produced butyrate from lysine only. Abundant butyric acid was also produced from glucose. The in vitro activity of 15 antibiotics on 5 strains was studied by broth dilution tests. Uniformly, the strains showed resistance to aminoglycosides and polymyxins (MIC values, 60-500 mug/ml) and susceptibility to tetracyclines, lincomycin, clindamycin, rifampicin, and erythromycin (MIC values, 0.05-0.5 mug/ml). Chloramphenicol, penicillins, and cephalosporins showed bacteriostatic activity at concentrations of 5-40 mug/ml. The serological behaviour of 5 strains was studied in cross-agglutination and gel-diffusion experiments. Cross-reactivity was pronounced in gel-diffusion tests using rabbit antisera and autoclaved extracts and extracts prepared by repeated deep-freezing and thawing of whole cell suspensions as antigens. However, antisera against the B. splanchnicus strains did not react with antigens of B. fragilis 6869, B. thetaiotaomicron AS 126, B. vulgatus AM 45 a, B. distasonis AII 104 and butyric acid-producing strains BM 158 and IPP 3751 in agglutination and gel-diffusion experiments, and there were no cross-reactions between B. splanchnicus antigens and antisera against B. fragilis 6869 and the other aforementioned strains. The new species has been confirmed by members of the ICSB Taxonomic Subcommittee for Gram negative anaerobic rods. Strains 1651/6 and S4/28 have been deposited in The National Collection of Type Cultures, London (NCTC numbers 10825 and 10826). Strain NCTC 10825 (= 1651/6) is the type of the species, B. splanchnicus.
TI  - Studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  - A study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. Three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on a rumen fluid roll tube medium (M98-5). Seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), Peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as Propionibacterium acnes and Eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as Bacteroides clostridiiformis, B. hypermegas and B. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as Clostridium sp.). Two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and Escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. The distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. Data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy source, minerals, reducing agent, Trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). The growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by CO(2) and rumen fluid. These preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen anaerobes.
TI  - Bacteroidaceae in thromboembolic disease: effects of cell wall components on blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro.
AB  - The effects of Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium mortiferum, Bacteroides fragilis, and Sphaerophorus necrophorus on various parameters of blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro were determined and compared to the coagulation effects of Escherichia coli and Salmonella minnesota, wild type and R595. Intravenous injection of washed cells, culture filtrate, lipopolysaccharide, or lipid A of the anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms into mice resulted in acceleration of coagulation. Lipopolysaccharide and lipid A of the anaerobic microorganisms had no apparent effect on circulating platelets in mice or rabbits and did not cause aggregation of human platelets in vitro. Washed cells, lipopolysaccharide, and lipid A of Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum also significantly accelerated the clotting time of recalcified platelet poor normal human plasma and C6-deficient rabbit plasma. Lipid A, but not lipopolysaccharide, of E. coli and washed cells of S. minnesota R595 accelerated coagulation by a similar mechanism. These results indicated that Bacteroides sp. and F. mortiferum can accelerate blood coagulation in vivo and in vitro by a mechanism which does not involve platelets or terminal components of complement.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of 601 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to 10 different antimicrobial agents were determined by an agar-dilution technique. Nearly all strains were resistant to kanamycin and gentamicin, although moderate activity to both drugs was noted with Fusobacterium sp., anaerobic cocci, some strains of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and nonsporeforming gram-positive bacilli. Chloramphenicol at 12.5 mug/ml inhibited all but three of the strains tested. Tetracycline at 6.25 mug/ml had high activity against all groups tested, with the exception that only 39% of strains of Bacteroides fragilis were inhibited at this concentration. Excluding certain species of Bacteroides, the majority of anaerobes were inhibited by penicillin at 3.1 mug/ml or less and by cephalothin at 12.5 mug/ml or less. Lincomycin at 6.2 mug/ml or less was active against nearly all strains. Erythromycin at a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml was active against B. fragilis; however, erythromycin was less active against the other groups. Most of the minimal inhibitory concentrations of lincomycin exceeded those of clindamycin by fourfold. Rifampin inhibited virtually all strains at 3.1 mug/ml.
TI  - Oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. Strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at pO(2) levels greater than 0.5%. Species that were found to be strict anaerobes were Treponema macrodentium, Treponema denticola, Treponema oralis n. sp., Clostridium haemolyticum, Selenomonas ruminatium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and Lachnospira multiparus. Moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. The moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. Species considered as moderate anaerobes were Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, B. oralis, Fusobacteria nucleatum, Clostridium novyi type A, and Peptostreptococcus elsdenii. The recognition of at least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
TI  - BACTEROIDES ORALIS, PROPOSED NEW SPECIES ISOLATED FROM THE ORAL CAVITY OF MAN.
AB  - Loesche, W. J. (Forsyth Dental Center and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, Boston, Mass.), S. S. Socransky, and R. J. Gibbons. Bacteroides oralis, proposed new species isolated from the oral cavity of man. J. Bacteriol. 88:1329-1337. 1964.-Twenty-seven strains of oral bacteroides were characterized and compared with a National Collection of Type Cultures strain of Bacteroides fragilis as well as strains of intestinal bacteroides. A combination of acid end products, gas production, pentose fermentation, and 10% bile tolerance afforded a basis for separation of oral strains from intestinal strains. The oral strains produced succinic, lactic, acetic, and formic acids but no gas. They were inhibited by 10% bile, and did not ferment xylose and arabinose. Intestinal strains consistent with the description for B. fragilis produced succinic, formic, acetic, and propionic acids and gas, with a few strains forming lactic acid. They were stimulated by 10% beef bile, and fermented xylose and arabinose. The oral strains are sufficiently different from intestinal strains of the B. fragilis type, so that they appear to constitute a separate species. It is proposed that they be recognized as B. oralis, sp. n.
