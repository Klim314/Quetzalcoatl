TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == study in vitro of the impact of endophytic bacteria isolated from centella asiatica on the disease incidence caused by the hemibiotrophic fungus colletotrichum higginsianum.
AB  == thirty-one endophytic bacteria isolated from healthy leaves of centella asiatica  were screened in vitro for their ability to reduce the growth rate and disease incidence of colletotrichum higginsianum, a causal agent of anthracnose. isolates of cohnella sp., paenibacillus sp. and pantoea sp. significantly stimulated the growth rate of c. higginsianum mucl 44942, while isolates of achromobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., microbacterium sp., klebsiella sp. and pseudomonas putida had  no influence on this plant pathogen. by contrast, bacillus subtilis bca31 and pseudomonas fluorescens bca08 caused a marked inhibition of c. higginsianum mucl  44942 growth by 46 and 82 %, respectively. cell-free culture filtrates of b. subtilis bca31 and p. fluorescens bca08 were found to contain antifungal compounds against c. higginsianum mucl 44942. inoculation assays on in vitro-cultured plants of c. asiatica showed that foliar application of b. subtilis bca31, three days before inoculation with c. higginsianum mucl 44942, significantly reduced incidence and severity of the disease. the role of endophytic bacteria in maintaining the apparent inactivity of c. higginsianum mucl 44942 in c. asiatica grown in the wild is discussed.

TI  == identification of the midgut microbiota of an. stephensi and an. maculipennis for their application as a paratransgenic tool against malaria.
AB  == the midgut microbiota associated with anopheles stephensi and anopheles maculipennis (diptera: culicidae) was investigated for development of a paratransgenesis-based approach to control malaria transmission in eastern mediterranean region (emr). here, we present the results of a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and biochemical-based approaches to identify the female adult and  larvae mosquitoe microbiota of these two major malaria vectors, originated from south eastern and north of iran. plating the mosquito midgut contents from lab-reared and field-collected anopheles spp. was used for microbiota isolation.  the gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial colonies were identified by gram staining and specific mediums. selected colonies were identified by differential  biochemical tests and 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a number of 10 an. stephensi and 32 an. maculipennis adult mosquitoes and 15 an. stephensi and 7 an. maculipennis larvae were analyzed and 13 sequences of 16s rrna gene bacterial species were retrieved, that were categorized in 3 classes and 8 families. the majority of the identified bacteria were belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class, including pseudomonas sp. and aeromonas sp. and the others were some closely related to those found in other vector mosquitoes, including pantoea, acinetobacter, brevundimonas, bacillus, sphingomonas, lysinibacillus and rahnella. the 16s rrna sequences in the current study aligned with the reference  strains available in genbank were used for construction of the phylogenetic tree  that revealed the relatedness among the bacteria identified. the presented data strongly encourage further investigations, to verify the potential role of the detected bacteria for the malaria control in iran and neighboring countries.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in isolated bacteria  from seawater of algiers beaches (algeria).
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

TI  == characterization of phragmites cummunis rhizosphere bacterial communities and metabolic products during the two stage sequential treatment of post methanated distillery effluent by bacteria and wetland plants.
AB  == this study deals with the characterization of rhizosphere bacterial communities and metabolic products produced during the two stage sequential treatment of post methanated distillery effluent by bacteria and constructed wetland plants. results showed that bacterial treatment followed by wetland plants (phragmites cummunis) resulted 94.5% and 96.0% reduction in bod and cod values, respectively. the pcr-rflp analysis showed the presence of stenotrophomonas, enterobacter, pantoea, acinetobacter and klebsiella sp., as dominant rhizosphere bacterial communities which play an important role in degradation and decolorization of pmde in wetland treatment system. further, the lc-ms-ms and other spectrophotometric analysis have shown that most of the pollutants detected in untreated pmde were diminished from bacteria and wetland plant treated pmde indicating that bacteria and wetland plant rhizosphere microbes utilized them as  carbon, nitrogen and energy source. while, methylbenzene, furfuryl alcohol, and 4-vinyl-2-methoxyphenol were detected as metabolites in bacteria and hexadecanol  in wetland plant rhizosphere treated pmde.

TI  == soil type affects plant colonization, activity and catabolic gene expression of inoculated bacterial strains during phytoremediation of diesel.
AB  == the combined use of plants and associated microorganisms has great potential for  cleaning up soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. apart from environmental conditions the physicochemical properties of the soil are the main  factors influencing the survival and activity of an inoculated strain as well as  the growth of plants. this study examined the effect of different soil types (sandy, loamy sand and loam) on the survival, gene abundance and catabolic gene expression of two inoculated strains (pseudomonas sp. strain itri53 and pantoea sp. strain btrh79) in the rhizosphere and shoot interior of italian ryegrass vegetated in diesel contaminated soils. high colonization, gene abundance and expression in loamy soils were observed. by contrast, low colonization, gene abundance and absence of gene expression in sandy soil were found. the highest levels of genes expression and hydrocarbon degradation were seen in loamy soil that had been inoculated with btrh79 and were significantly higher compared to those in other soils. a positive correlation was observed between gene expression and hydrocarbon degradation indicating that catabolic gene expression is necessary for contaminant degradation. these results suggest that soil type influences the bacterial colonization and microbial activities and subsequently the efficiency of contaminant degradation.

TI  == characterization of an endophytic bacterial community associated with eucalyptus  spp.
AB  == endophytic bacteria were isolated from stems of eucalyptus spp (eucalyptus citriodora, e. grandis, e. urophylla, e. camaldulensis, e. torelliana, e. pellita, and a hybrid of e. grandis and e. urophylla) cultivated at two sites; they were characterized by rapd and amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra).  endophytic bacteria were more frequently isolated from e. grandis and e. pellita. the 76 isolates were identified by 16s rdna sequencing as erwinia/pantoea (45%),  agrobacterium sp (21%), curtobacterium sp (9%), brevibacillus sp (8%), pseudomonas sp (8%), acinetobacter sp (4%), burkholderia cepacia (2.6%), and lactococcus lactis (2.6%). genetic characterization of these endophytic bacteria  isolates showed at least eight ardra haplotypes. the genetic diversity of 32 erwinia/pantoea and 16 agrobacterium sp isolates was assessed with the rapd technique. there was a high level of genetic polymorphism among all the isolates  and there was positive correlation between the clusters and the geographic origin of the strains. these endophytic bacteria were further analyzed for in vitro interaction with endophytic fungi from eucalyptus spp. we found that metabolites  secreted by erwinia/pantoea and b. cepacia isolates had an inhibitory growth effect on some endophytic fungi, suggesting that these metabolites play a role in bacterial-fungal interactions inside the host plant. apparently, these bacteria could have an important role in plant development; in the future they may be useful for biological control of diseases and plant growth promotion, as well as  for the production of new metabolites and enzymes.

TI  == robustness of the bacterial community in the cabbage white butterfly larval midgut.
AB  == microbial communities typically vary in composition and structure over space and  time. little is known about the inherent characteristics of communities that govern various drivers of these changes, such as random variation, changes in response to perturbation, or susceptibility to invasion. in this study, we use 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences to describe variation among bacterial communities in the midguts of cabbage white butterfly (pieris rapae) larvae and examine the influence of community structure on susceptibility to invasion. we compared communities in larvae experiencing the same conditions at different times (temporal variation) or fed different diets (perturbation). the most highly represented phylum was proteobacteria, which was present in all midgut communities. the observed species richness ranged from six to 15, and the most abundant members affiliated with the genera methylobacteria, asaia, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and pantoea. individual larvae subjected to the same conditions at the same time harbored communities that were highly similar in structure and membership, whereas the communities observed within larval populations changed with diet and over time. in addition, structural changes due  to perturbation coincided with enhanced susceptibility to invasion by enterobacter sp. nab3r and pantoea stewartii cwb600, suggesting that resistance to invasion is in part governed by community structure. these findings along with the observed conservation of membership at the phylum level, variation in structure and membership at lower taxonomic levels, and its relative simplicity make the cabbage white butterfly larval community an attractive model for studying community dynamics and robustness.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial community and characterization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from different genotypes of chrysopogon zizanioides (l.) roberty (vetiver) rhizospheres.
AB  == molecular approaches [pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] were used to determine whether three different vetiver (chrysopogon zizanioides) genotypes, commercially used in brazil and considered economically important over the world, select specific bacterial populations to coexist in their rhizospheres. dgge profiles revealed that the predominant rhizospheric bacterial  community hardly varies regarding the vetiver genotype. moreover, using traditional cultivation methods, bacterial strains were isolated from the different rhizospheres. colonies presenting different morphologies (83) were selected for determining their potential for plant growth promotion. more than half of the strains tested (57.8%) were amplified by pcr using nifh-based primers, specific for the enzyme nitrogenase reductase. the production of siderophores was observed in 88% of the strains, while the production of antimicrobial substances was detected in only 14.5% of the isolates when micrococcus sp. was used as the indicator strain. production of indole-3-acetic acid and the solubilization of phosphate were observed in 55.4% and 59% of the isolates, respectively. in total, 44 strains (53%) presented at least three characteristics of plant growth promotion and were submitted to amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. twenty-four genetic groups were formed at 100% similarity and one representative of each group was selected for their identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. they were affiliated with the genera acinetobacter, comamonas, chryseobacterium, klebsiella, enterobacter, pantoea, dyella, burkholderia, or pseudomonas. these strains can be considered of great importance as possible biofertilizers in vetiver.

TI  == arsenic detoxification potential of aox genes in arsenite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from natural and constructed wetlands in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenic is subject to microbial interactions, which support a wide range of biogeochemical transformations of elements in natural environments such as wetlands. the arsenic detoxification potential of the bacterial strains was investigated with the arsenite oxidation gene, aox genotype, which were isolated  from the natural and constructed wetlands. the isolates were able to grow in the  presence of 10 mm of sodium arsenite (as(iii) as naaso(2)) and 1 mm of d: +glucose. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that  these isolated strains resembled members of the genus that have arsenic-resistant systems (acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp., agrobacterium sp., comamonas sp., enterobacter sp., pantoea sp., and pseudomonas sp.) with sequence similarities of 81-98%. one bacterial isolate identified as pseudomonas stutzeri strain gist-bdan2 (ef429003) showed the activity of arsenite oxidation and existence of  aoxb and aoxr gene, which could play an important role in arsenite oxidation to arsenate. this reaction may be considered as arsenic detoxification process. the  results of a batch test showed that p. stutzeri gist-bdan2 (ef429003) completely  oxidized in 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 25-30 h. in this study, microbial activity was evaluated to provide a better understanding of arsenic biogeochemical cycle in both natural and constructed wetlands, where ecological niches for microorganisms could be different, with a specific focus on arsenic oxidation/reduction and detoxification.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.

TI  == nitrogen-fixing chemo-organotrophic bacteria isolated from cyanobacteria-deprived lichens and their ability to solubilize phosphate and to release amino acids and  phytohormones.
AB  == aims: cyanobacteria-deprived lichens of the species canoparmelia caroliniana, canoparmelia crozalsiana, canoparmelia texana, parmotrema sancti-angeli and parmotrema tinctorum were screened for the presence of chemo-organotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. methods and results: fifty-three lichen samples subjected to enrichment selection using a nitrogen-free minimal medium were positive for acetylene reduction. seventeen isolates, able to fix nitrogen, belonged to gamma-proteobacteria group and were identified as: acinetobacter sp., pantoea sp., pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas stutzeri, serratia marcescens and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, according to 16s rrna gene sequences and biochemical tests. the excretion of amino acid and phytohormone and the ability of mineral phosphate solubilization were determined in 14 isolates. all isolates  were able to release amino acids and 3-indoleacetic acid. about 64% of the isolates solubilized phosphates and 30% released ethylene. conclusions: these data confirm sparse evidence from the literature on the occurrence of chemo-organotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in cyanobacteria-deprived lichens; the isolates presented physiologic features which might benefit the host if they  are expressed when the bacteria are harboured by lichens. significance and impact of the study: chemo-organotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria were isolated from a high percentage (72.6%) of cyanobacteria-deprived lichens. all isolates presented important physiological characteristics, some of which are being described here for the first time.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
