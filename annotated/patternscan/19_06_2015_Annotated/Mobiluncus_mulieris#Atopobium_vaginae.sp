TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == development of a microarray-based tool to characterize vaginal bacterial fluctuations and application to a novel antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the healthy vaginal microbiota is generally dominated by lactobacilli that confer antimicrobial protection and play a crucial role in health. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most prevalent lower genital tract infection in women in reproductive age and is characterized by a shift in the relative abundances of lactobacillus spp. to a greater abundance of strictly anaerobic bacteria. in this study, we designed a new phylogenetic microarray-based tool (vaginarray) that includes 17 probe sets specific for the most representative bacterial groups of the human vaginal ecosystem. this tool was implemented using the ligase detection reaction-universal array (ldr-ua) approach. the entire probe set properly recognized the specific targets and showed an overall sensitivity of 6 to 12 ng per probe. the vaginarray was applied to assess the efficacy of rifaximin vaginal tablets for the treatment of bv, analyzing the vaginal bacterial communities of 22 bv-affected women treated with rifaximin vaginal tablets at a dosage of 25 mg/day for 5 days. our results showed the ability of rifaximin to reduce the growth of various bv-related bacteria (atopobium vaginae, prevotella, megasphaera, mobiluncus, and sneathia spp.), with the highest antibiotic susceptibility for a. vaginae and sneathia spp. moreover, we observed an increase of lactobacillus crispatus levels in the subset of women who maintained remission after 1 month of therapy, opening new perspectives for the treatment of bv.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == quantification of atopobium vaginae loads may be a new method for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: traditional methods for the diagnosis of bv is either with poor sensitivity or poor specificity. thus, establishing a new method based on the vaginal flora is vital for the diagnosis of bv. methods: this article is a retrospective research. based on the amsel criteria and nugent score, 230 bv-positive patients and 360 healthy women were enrolled, specific pcr and quantitative pcr were applied to quantify 5 bv-associated bacteria, including gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species and mobiluncus mulieris. roc curve was facilitated to screen  a bacterial panel with optimal sensitivity and specificity. results: specific pcr showed that the area under roc curve of a.vag, g.vag + a.vag, g.vag + a.vag + lepto, g.vag + a.vag + mega and g.vag + a.vag + m.mul were 0.845, 0.862, 0.865, 0.869 and 0.867, the sensitivity and specificity were higher than 80%, which were practicable methods for the diagnosis of bv. quantitative pcr showed the area under roc curve of gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species and mobiluncus mulieris were 0.959, 0.996, 0.933, 0.748 and 0.639, when the cutoff value of atopobium vaginae  loads was 247,800 copies/ml, the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 0.979 and 0.952, which was distinctly better than specific pcr. conclusions: quantification ofatopobium vaginae loads may be a new method of excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of bv.

TI  == [diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in the normal vaginal flora. when symptomatic, it is associated with  a malodorous vaginal discharge and on occasion vaginal burning or itching. under  normal conditions, lactobacilli constitute 95% of the bacteria in the vagina. bacterial vaginosis is associated with severe reduction or absence of the normal  h2o2-producing lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and gardnerella  vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis and mobiluncus species. most types of infectious disease are diagnosed by culture, by isolating an antigen or  rna/dna from the microbe, or by serodiagnosis to determine the presence of antibodies to the microbe. therefore, demonstration of the presence of an infectious agent is often a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of the disease. this is not the case for bacterial vaginosis, since the ultimate cause of the disease is not yet known. there are a variety of methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis but no method can at present be regarded as the best. diagnosing bacterial vaginosis has long been based on the clinical criteria of amsel, whereby three of four defined criteria must be satisfied. nugent's scoring system has been further developed and includes validation of the categories of observable bacteria structures. up-to-date molecular tests are introduced, and better understanding of vaginal microbiome, a clear definition for bacterial vaginosis, and short-term and long-term fluctuations in vaginal microflora will help to better define molecular tests within the broader clinical context.

TI  == the complex vaginal flora of west african women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. these methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in africa where bv is highly prevalent. methods: an analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four west african countries. samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had bv. nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with bv were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. results: the associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. excluding lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. the prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and hiv status. in multivariate analysis, the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, bifidobacterium, megasphaera elsdenii, dialister, mycoplasma hominis, leptotrichia, and prevotella were independently associated with bv as was the absence of lactobacillus and peptoniphilus. however, mobiluncus, atopobium vaginae, anaerococcus, and eggerthella were not independently associated with bv. unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. conclusions: numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in  a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. bv cases with a simpler flora  were less likely to respond to treatment. overall, the vaginal flora of west african women with bv was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == [the bacterial vaginosis--treatment problems].
AB  == the changes in vaginal ecosystem (decreasing number of h2o2 producing lactobacillus spp. and increasing number of mobiluncus spp., gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, prevotella spp., mycoplasma hominis, peptostreptococcus spp.) appears to be a major cause of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bacterial vaginosis is associated with infectious complications in pregnant and non-pregnant women and increasing risk of sti. the preventive role of natural vaginal microflora and problems of bv treatment are discussed in the light of the recent publications.

TI  == a preliminary survey of atopobium vaginae in women attending the dunedin gynaecology out-patients clinic: is the contribution of the hard-to-culture microbiota overlooked in gynaecological disorders?
AB  == preliminary studies have indicated that the recently described bacterium atopobium vaginae may have an association with bacterial vaginosis (bv). fifty-five women attending the gynaecology out-patient's clinic were tested for the presence of this micro-organism, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and bacteroides species by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assays. the frequency of detection was 40%. pcr detection of gardnerella vaginalis with a. vaginae, occurred in 50% of a. vaginae-positive cases. due to the high detection  rate of a. vaginae we believe that it is important to determine whether this and  other hard-to-culture microorganisms have a role in gynaecological disorders.
