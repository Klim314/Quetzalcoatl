TI  == an analysis of human pathogens found in horse/mule manure along the john muir trail in kings canyon and sequoia and yosemite national parks.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic for humans in horse/mule manure along the john muir trail (jmt). methods: random samples of horse/mule manure were collected along sections of the jmt in yosemite, kings canyon, and sequoia national parks (np), as well as in portions of the pacific crest trail (pct) and selected jmt/pct access trails. convenience samples of wild animal scat found within i mile of trails were also collected. the fresh specimens were individually preserved both in 0.9% saline and polyvinyl alcohol (pva)-containing tubes and stored at 4 degrees c until time of analysis. bacteriological analysis was performed using standard microbiology laboratory procedures. pva samples were stained with trichrome and were then examined by a parasitologist. results: collection: a total of 186 trail miles were sampled, including 113 on the jmt (yosemite 37, kings 53, and sequoia 23). the pct samplings included 24 miles, and np and wilderness area access trails added an additional 49 miles. a total of 102 samples were collected, which included 81 samples from pack animals and 21 identified as having come from wild  animals. pack animal bacteria: all plated specimens grew large numbers of commensal gut flora. potential pathogenic bacteria were found in only 12 samples  and included hafnia alvei (4), serratia odorifera (1), citrobacter freundii (1),  escherichia vulneris (1), clostridium clostridioforme (1), yersinia enterocolitica (1), sherwinella putraformus (1), and enterobacter spp (4). no escherichia coli o157, salmonella, or aeromonas were found. microscopic examination for protozoal organisms revealed occasional commensal ciliates and i  giardia. wild animal pathogens: one specimen grew y enterocolitica, and another grew enterobacter amnigenus. conclusions: we found a low prevalence of human pathogens in pack animal manure on the jmt.

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.
