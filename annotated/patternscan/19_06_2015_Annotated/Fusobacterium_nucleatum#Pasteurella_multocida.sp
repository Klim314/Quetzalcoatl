TI  == bacterial periplasmic sialic acid-binding proteins exhibit a conserved binding site.
AB  == sialic acids are a family of related nine-carbon sugar acids that play important  roles in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. these sialic acids are incorporated/decorated onto lipooligosaccharides as terminal sugars in multiple bacteria to evade the host immune system. many pathogenic bacteria scavenge sialic acids from their host and use them for molecular mimicry. the first step of this process is the transport of sialic acid to the cytoplasm, which often takes place using a tripartite atp-independent transport system consisting of a periplasmic binding protein and a membrane transporter. in this paper, the structural characterization of periplasmic binding proteins from the pathogenic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, pasteurella multocida and vibrio cholerae and their thermodynamic characterization are reported. the binding affinities of several mutations in the neu5ac binding site of the haemophilus influenzae protein are also reported. the structure and the thermodynamics of the binding of sugars suggest that all of these proteins have a very well conserved binding pocket and similar binding affinities. a significant conformational change occurs when these proteins bind the sugar. while the c1 carboxylate has been identified  as the primary binding site, a second conserved hydrogen-bonding network is involved in the initiation and stabilization of the conformational states.

TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of abt-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu for anaerobes. the following are the mic ranges and mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of abt-773 for various isolates, respectively: pasteurella multocida and pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other  pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. for anaerobes the mic  ranges and mic(90)s of abt-773 were as follows, respectively: prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml;  fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. abt-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against s. aureus, e. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against f. nucleatum. the activity of abt-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against pasteurella spp., and abt-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against pasteurella spp. abt-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.

TI  == activities of hmr 3004 (ru 64004) and hmr 3647 (ru 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite  pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  == the activities of hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (mic at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [mic90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [bacteroides tectum, porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), prevotella heparinolytica, porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except  fusobacterium nucleatum (hmr 3004, mic90 = 16 microg/ml; hmr 3647, mic90 = 8 microg/ml) and other fusobacterium species (mic90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). in general, hmr 3004 and hmr 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all pasteurella species, including pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, eikenella  corrodens, and fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against corynebacterium species, weeksella zoohelcum, b. tectum, and p. heparinolytica.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of cefotaxime tested against infrequently isolated pathogenic species (unusual pathogens).
AB  == the cefotaxime sodium spectrum of activity is very broad and includes many common species and a variety of less frequently isolated pathogens. we have reviewed the clinical microbiology literature (44 references) and the data base of the university of iowa hospitals and clinics (iowa city, ia) to collect data on the activity of cefotaxime against the less common species. cefotaxime was consistently active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga  spp., eikenella corrodens, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, pasteurella multocida, plesiomonas shigelloides, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the species alcaligenes xylosoxidans, flavobacterium spp., stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, and rhodococcus equi were uniformly cefotaxime resistant. for many other species there was considerable variation in  reported minimum inhibitory concentrations. these data may be helpful in guiding  therapy of unusual infections, particularly in the case of fastidious species, where the appropriate susceptibility testing methodology may not be immediately or routinely available.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.
