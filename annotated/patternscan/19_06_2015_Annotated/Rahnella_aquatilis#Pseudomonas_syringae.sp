TI  == identification of cis- and trans-acting elements in phw126, a representative of a novel group of rolling circle plasmids.
AB  == phw126, pigrk, pigms31 and prao1 are the only known members of a novel and as yet uncharacterised family of rolling circle plasmids. phw126 contains only two open  reading frames, of which one shows homology to pmv158-family mobilisation proteins. here we provide evidence that the second open reading frame encodes a replication protein (rep). mutation or deletion of this gene resulted in replication deficient constructs, but providing functional rep from a compatible  vector rescued these constructs, indicating that rep acts in trans. an approximately 300 bp cis-acting region representing the origin of replication was identified upstream of the rep gene. the origin was identified to be composed of  three parts: an accessory region, a conserved stretch and four perfect tandem repeats. the two latter elements were essential for replication. constructs with  a deletion of the accessory region could still replicate, but their loss rate was high, indicating that the accessory region is necessary for plasmid maintenance under non-selective conditions. interestingly, phw126 could replicate in all enterobacteriaceae tested while agrobacterium tumefaciens and pseudomonas syringae were inappropriate hosts. thus, phw126 seems to have a rather limited host range.

TI  == occurrence of indole-3-acetic acid-producing bacteria on pear trees and their association with fruit russet.
AB  == abstract a relatively high percentage of epiphytic bacteria on pear leaf and fruit surfaces had the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) in culture media supplemented with tryptophan. while over 50% of the strains produced at least small amounts of iaa in culture, about 25% of the strains exhibited high iaa production as evidenced by both colorimetric and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of culture supernatants. a majority of the strains that produced high amounts of iaa were identified as erwinia herbicola (pantoea agglomerans), while some strains of pseudomonas syringae, pseudomonas viridiflava, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, and rahnella aquaticus  that produced high amounts of iaa also were found on pear. fruit russeting was significantly increased in 39 out of 46 trials over an 8-year period in which iaa-producing bacteria were applied to trees compared with control trees. a linear relationship was observed between fruit russet severity and the logarithm  of the population size of different iaa-producing bacteria on trees in the 30 days after inoculation, when normalized for the amount of iaa produced by each strain in culture. on average, the severity of fruit russet was only about 77% that on control trees when trees were treated at the time of bloom with pseudomonas fluorescens strain a506, which does not produce iaa. both total bacterial populations on pear in the 30-day period following full bloom and fruit russet severity varied greatly from year to year and in different commercial orchards over a 10-year period. there was a strong linear correlation between the logarithm of total bacterial population sizes and fruit russet severity.
