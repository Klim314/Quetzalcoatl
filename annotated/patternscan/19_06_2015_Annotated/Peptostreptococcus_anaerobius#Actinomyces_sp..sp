TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

TI  == production of antagonistic substance by eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  == aims: antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. however, reports regarding this phenomenon in eikenella corrodens are not available. methods and results: nineteen e. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (e. corrodens atcc23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. the following indicators were used: porphyromonas gingivalis fdc381, prevotella intermedia atcc25611, actinomyces israelii atcc12102, eubacterium lentum atcc25559, peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc27337, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdcy4, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc10953, streptococcus sanguinis atcc10557, streptococcus uberis atcc9927, streptococcus mutans im/ufrj, staphylococcus aureus atcc33591 and candida albicans atcc18804. all the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains.  this phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and  those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). conclusions: the heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by e. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: this is the first description of antagonistic compound production by e. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  == propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. in the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in turkey and from brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated.  ethanol extracts of propolis (eep) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of eep on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. all strains were susceptible and mic values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. propolis from kazan-ankara showed most effective mic values to the studied microorganisms. mbc values of kazan-ankara eep samples  were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. death was observed within 4 h of incubation  for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for prevotella oralis and prevotella melaninogenica and porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for veillonella parvula. it was shown that propolis samples were more effective against gram positive anaerobic bacteria than gram negative ones. the organic chemical compositions of eeps were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the main compounds of eeps were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  == the bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. although recent studies have used dna probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. the purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. the most frequently isolated species included peptostreptococcus anaerobius, collinsella aerofaciens, eubacterium group, actinomyces spp., eikenella corrodens, veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented prevotella spp. and selenomonas spp. reported for the first time are actinomyces turicensis, collinsella aerofaciens, eubacterium saburreum, e. timidum, prevotella tannerae, campylobacter concisus, campylobacter mucosalis, leptotrichia buccalis, selenomonas flueggei, and centipeda periodontii. species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == development of an anaerobic bacterial leakage model.
AB  == the majority of bacteria associated with infections of endodontic origin are strict anaerobes. the purpose of this study was to develop an endodontic microleakage model using strict anaerobic bacteria in a two-chamber system. nine  species of anaerobic bacteria were tested for viability and detection by either turbidity or color change of the broth. a survey of ph chromogenic substrates revealed that bromcresol purple (ph 5.2 = yellow, ph 6.8 = purple) could be used  as a chromogenic indicator to detect the growth of anaerobic bacteria. peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth (pyg) and brain heart infusion broth (bhi) were each used alone and with bromcresol purple (bppyg, bpbhi) in this study. fusobacterium nucleatum and f. necrophorum were viable in all four media for > 2  wk and produced both turbidity and a color change after only 1 day of incubation. veillonella parvula in either bpbhi or bhi and peptostreptococcus anaerobius in either bppyg or bhi were viable for > 2 wk and showed a color change or turbidity after 1 or 2 days. the results indicate that leakage of strict anaerobes may be evaluated in a two-chamber system.

TI  == non-sporing anaerobes in certain surgical group of patients.
AB  == the magnitude of non-sparing anaerobic (nsa) infections has been defined in the postoperative wounds on colorectum in children (57.1%), general surgery (0%), abdominoperineal and uterocervical operations (11-45%) in gynaecologic and obstetrical cases and perforative peritonitis (25.8-32.3%). children below the 6  months age group bear less risk of acquiring nsa infection. under certain situations, metronidazole combats nsa infections in a better way than other antibacterials. the bacteriology of nsa infections has been probed at the species level in the gynaecologic and obstetrical patients. the species of normal cervix  (44.6%) are represented in wounds involving abdominal wall (11%), perineum (22.8%) and uterocervix (45.6%) to suggest endogenous infection. out of the 22 species of nsa isolated, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidaminococcus fermentans and peptococcus prevotii are the commonest. others were peptococcus niger, gaffkya anaerobia, lactobacillus bulgaricus, actinomyces bovis, bacteroides oralis, fusobacterium gonidiaformans and the different species of peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium and fusobacterium. the weight of evidence indicated a pathogenic role of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and ruminococcus flavefaciens, in view of their heavy growth. the umbrella of antibacterials reduced gram-positive anaerobic cocci from 40% to 16%. the facultative anaerobes staph aureus, staph epidermidis, kl pneumoniae and proteus appeared as the exogenous agents of nosocomial infections.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.

TI  == [actinomycosis infection of the cerebellum].
AB  == the case is presented of a 37-year-old male with a cerebellar abscess due to actinomyces israelii. the patient was admitted after dental surgery because of fever and symptoms indicative of raised, intracranial pressure. no abnormalities  were detected in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid. ct scan revealed a space-occupying lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere with perifocal oedema and occlusive hydrocephalus. after emergency external ventriculostomy complete removal of the mass was achieved in a two-stage surgical procedure. culture of the pus under anaerobic conditions resulted in a growth of actinomyces israelii,  peptostreptococcus anaerobius and bifidobacterium adolescentis. a 20-day regimen  of antibiotics including penicillin g 10 million u x 3/d and clindamycin 900 mg x 3/d was administered. the patient made a full recovery. pathogenesis and therapeutic principles of cns infections due to actinomyces israellii are discussed.

TI  == experimental studies of survival of anaerobic bacteria at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c in two different transport systems.
AB  == the survival of anaerobic bacteria on swabs in two different transport systems at 4 degrees c and 22 degrees c was evaluated. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart transport medium (mst), and a viscose swab in modified siff transport medium (btm) (bionor). the following eight clinical strains of anaerobic bacteria were tested for quantitative recovery at 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h; fusobacterium necrophorum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tetani, and actinomyces  israelii. additionally, a mixture of staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli was tested together with bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium necrophorum and clostridium perfringens. both transport systems preserved the bacteria, but the btm medium gave a better quantitative recovery of the bacteria than the mst in 29/64 (45%) of the experiments, whereas the opposite was the case in 15/64 (23%)  of the experiments (p < 0.05). there was no significant strain-related difference between the recovery of 10 different b. fragilis strains. there was no major difference in the recovery of the anaerobes in the two systems at 4 degrees c compared to 22 degrees c, except for fusobacterium necrophorum, which survived best at 4 degrees c in the bionor transport system.

TI  == associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == reactivity of igg from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  == the presence of igg in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. the purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of igg from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. a dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-elisa) was used to demonstrate the presence of igg in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. the percentages of reactivity by dot-elisa follow: bacteroides intermedius (84%), b.  buccae (12%), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), p. endodontalis (58%), p. asaccharolyticus (17%), peptostreptococcus micros (44%), p. anaerobius  (26%), eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and actinomyces israelii (6%). at least one of the three species of b. intermedius, p. gingivalis, or p. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-elisa with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. a lack of cross reactivity of igg in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented bacteroides/porphyromonas by dot-elisa.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == bactericidal effects of human neutrophils and sera on selected endodontic pathogenic bacteria in an anaerobic environment.
AB  == phagocytosis by normal human neutrophils and the bactericidal activity of normal  human pooled serum were measured under anaerobic conditions on six endodontic pathogenic bacterial species from the genera actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus and streptococcus. the results revealed that actinomyces viscosus was not killed either by human neutrophils or by 20 per cent serum; peptostreptococcus anaerobius was not killed by either 20 per cent or 95 per cent serum; and bacteroides intermedius was susceptible to both 20 per cent and 95 per cent serum, but was not killed by neutrophils after exposure for 20 minutes. the other species showed intermediate susceptibility patterns. such results suggest that oral pathogens vary with regard to the bactericidal effects  of these two host defense mechanisms, and that this variation may at least in part explain the relative quantities of microbes recovered in certain oral infections.

TI  == the obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  == samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. all mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. a mixed growth was obtained from all samples. the mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. of the facultatively anaerobic species, actinomyces (including a. viscosus, a. hordeovulneris and a. denticolens) comprised 12%, pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were  isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates,  wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were peptostreptococcus anaerobius.  the most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was c. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was p. multocida. these findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar  in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.

TI  == occurrence of anaerobic bacteria in diseases of the dog and cat.
AB  == a survey for anaerobic bacteria was conducted in 314 clinical specimens from dogs and cats. a total of 187 anaerobic isolates in pure and mixed culture were isolated from 111 of the specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria. common isolated included actinomyces (9.1%), clostridium perfringens (19.3%), other clostridium spp (11.2%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (7.5%), bacteroides melaninogenicus (13.4%), other bacteroides spp (17.6%), and fusobacterium necrophorum (5.3%). anaerobic bacteria were involved in serious lesions that often were life threatening to the animals. antibiotic susceptibility data indicated that the lincomycin family, the penicillin family, chloramphenicol, and cephaloridine are preferred drugs for treatment of anaerobic infections. data from the survey were used in formulation of a table to aid practitioners in clinical diagnosis of disease caused by anaerobes. clostridium perfringens was isolated in large numbers from five of six dogs with a clinical diagnosis of canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and from one cat with hemorrhagic diarrhea. experimental infections were induced in rats, using caine feces as inoculum. induced lesions contained aerobic and anaerobic bacteria similar to those bacteria isolated in the clinical survey, indicating that feces may serve as a major source of these bacteria in clinical infections of the dog.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical formation in anaerobic broth media exposed to atmospheric oxygen.
AB  == fourteen different broth media were autoclaved under anaerobic conditions and then exposed to atmospheric oxygen. the hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical  formation as well as the bactericidal effect of the media were studied. the rate  of killing of peptostreptococcus anaerobius vpi 4330-1 was high in media that rapidly autoxidized and accumulated hydrogen peroxide. in actinomyces broth (bbl), 50% of the cells were killed within 2 min, and in brewer thioglycolate medium (difco), 50% were killed within 11 min, whereas more than 50% of the cells survived for more than 2 h in clausen medium (oxoid), fluid thioglycolate medium  (bbl), and thioglycolate medium without dextrose or indicator (difco). only media that contained phosphate and glucose had a tendency to accumulate hydrogen peroxide. a solution of phosphate and glucose autoxidized when it had been heated to 120 degrees c for at least 5 min and when the ph of the solution was higher than 6.5. transitional metal ions catalyzed the autoxidation, but they were not necessary for the reaction to occur. of the other substances heated in phosphate  buffer, only alpha-hydroxycarbonyl compounds autoxidized with accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. superoxide dismutase decreased the autoxidation rate of most of the broth media. this indicated that superoxide radicals were generated in these media.

TI  == bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to atmospheric oxygen tested on peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain vpi 4330-1 was used as the test organism in  an evaluation of the bactericidal effect of anaerobic broth exposed to air. the test organism, grown under anaerobic conditions in trypticase soy broth, was diluted in buffered salt solution, and about 2 x 10(4) cells were suspended in 10 ml of an aerated broth. ninety percent of the cells were killed within 15 min in  actinomyces broth and within 50 min in trypticase soy broth. all cells survived for 2 h in fluid thioglycolate medium. addition of dabco [1,4-diazabicyclo (2.2.2) octane] or mannitol to trypticase soy broth did not influence the death rate of the organism, whereas superoxide dismutase decreased the death rate. addition of catalase or manganese dioxide to the broth kept all the cells viable  for 2 h. of the three broth media tested, actinomyces broth reduced oxygen at the highest rate and trypticase soy broth reduced it at the slowest rate. hydrogen peroxide could be demonstrated in actinomyces broth and in trypticase soy broth but not in fluid thioglycolate medium. in addition to catalase, manganese dioxide also removed all hydrogen peroxide from trypticase soy broth, and superoxide dismutase significantly decreased the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the broth. the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide mediated the toxic effect of atmospheric oxygen in these broth media.
