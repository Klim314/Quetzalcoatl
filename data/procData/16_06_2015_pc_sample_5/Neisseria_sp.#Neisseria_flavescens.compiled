TI  - [Characteristics of microflora of laryngeal mucosa in healthy subjects and patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx].
AB  - The authors present data on the occurrence, density, and species composition of microorganisms isolated from pharyngeal mucosa of 40 healthy subjects and 55 patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx. The total density of microbial populations in control subjects was estimated at 2,672+/-614 CFU/ml compared with 17,510+/-1,983 CFU/ml in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx unrelated to malignant neoplastic growth and 19,375+/-2,103 CFU/ml in patients who had experienced surgical intervention for the treatment of malignancy. A total of 312 microbial strains were isolated and identified. Coccal bacteria were the predominant group (streptococci-74 strains, neisseria-72, staphylococci-62, micrococci-12). Collectively, they comprised 70.5% of all isolated strains representing autochthonous microflora. Corynebacteria, moraxellas, and enterobacteria (transitory forms) were rare. The occurrence of neisseria, staphylococci and fungi (genus Candida) in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx was significantly higher than in the healthy subjects. Moreover, the patients developed dysbacteriosis with the predominance of N. flavescens, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. alpha-haemoliticus, and Candida sp. It is concluded that elucidation of the microbial landscape in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx is of importance for planning prevention and management of pyoseptic complications in the course of surgical treatment.
TI  - The integration site of the iga gene in commensal Neisseria sp.
AB  - An IgA1 protease is produced by the human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, Neisseria species. In this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the N. gonorrhoeae strain MS11 and compared to corresponding loci in N. meningitidis and commensal Neisseria species. In N. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpB and ksgA were found immediately downstream of iga. In addition to comL and comA, a homolog of the Escherichia coli YFII gene was identified upstream of iga. Each gene in the iga region (YFII and comL, comA and iga, and trpB and ksgA) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. The comL/ comA and iga/ trpB pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. These terminators contain the common gonococcal DNA uptake sequence (DUS). A highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in N. gonorrhoeae was also found in N. meningitidis. In Southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal DNAs of the commensal species N. mucosa, N. lactamica, N. flavescens, N. cinerea, N. subflava, N. flava, N. sicca or N. elongata. When N. gonorrhoeae comL and trpB were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. This indicated that commensal Neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between comA and trpB. The region between comA and trpB was therefore amplified by PCR. The fragment obtained from N. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal comA and trpB, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology to any known gonococcal sequence. Our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. N. lactamica, which is more closely related to N. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.
TI  - Neisseria weaveri sp. nov., formerly CDC group M-5, a gram-negative bacterium associated with dog bite wounds.
AB  - CDC group M-5 is a rod-shaped, gram-negative, nonmotile bacterium associated with dog bite wounds. DNA-DNA relatedness and biochemical and growth characteristics were studied for 54 strains from the collection at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One typical M-5 strain, 8142, was further studied by 16S rRNA sequencing. DNA from 40 of 53 strains showed 82 to 100% relatedness (hydroxyapatite method) to labeled DNA from strain 8142. The guanine-plus-cytosine (G + C) content in 8 of the 41 highly related M-5 strains was 50.5 to 52 mol%. These 41 strains were oxidase and catalase positive, nonfermentative, nitrite positive, nitrate negative, weakly phenylalanine deaminase positive, aerobic, and alpha-hemolytic (sheep blood). DNA from the 13 remaining strains showed only 7 to 46% DNA relatedness to strain 8142. These 13 non-M-5 strains differed from the M-5 strains in G + C content, growth characteristics, and biochemical profiles. DNA from M-5 strain 8142 was most closely related to DNA from groups EF-4b (47%) and EF-4a (45%). 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed M-5 strain 8142 in the Neisseriaceae cluster of the beta-3 subgroup of the class Proteobacteria. It was most homologous (98.4 to 98.8%) to Neisseria animalis, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria canis, and Neisseria elongata. All data are consistent with M-5 being a new species of Neisseria, for which we propose the name Neisseria weaveri.
TI  - Phylogeny of species in the family Neisseriaceae isolated from human dental plaque and description of Kingella oralis sp. nov [corrected].
AB  - Fourteen human periodontal isolates recovered from a purported Eikenella corrodens-selective medium containing 1 microgram of clindamycin per ml displayed biochemical traits which differed from those described for E. corrodens. These organisms were gram-negative rods which corroded agar. The isolates were oxidase positive and urease, indole, and esculin negative. They differed from E. corrodens in catalase, nitrate reduction, lysine decarboxylase, and ornithine decarboxylase activities. One isolate, strain UB-294, was presumptively identified as Kingella denitrificans. A second isolate, strain UB-204, differed from E. corrodens by being catalase positive and nitrate reduction negative. Twelve isolates, including strain UB-38T (T = type strain), were phenotypically similar to Kingella kingae except that they did not produce acid from maltose and were not beta-hemolytic. Essentially complete (1,480-base) 16S rRNA sequences were determined for strains UB-38T, UB-204, and UB-294 and the type strains of Neisseria animalis, Neisseria canis, Neisseria denitrificans, Neisseria elongata, Neisseria flavescens, Neisseria macaca, and Neisseria polysaccharea. These sequences were compared with the previously published sequences of six other species belonging to the family Neisseriaceae. On the basis of the results of the comparative sequence analysis, UB-294 was confirmed as a K. denitrificans strain, UB-204 was identified as a member of a new species which may belong in the genus Eikenella, and UB-38T was identified as a member of a new species of the genus Kingella, for which we propose the name Kingella oralis [corrected]. Since strain UB-204 was the only representative of a new species, it was not named.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - A new taxon in the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Among 3,520 strains of Neisseria and Branhamella received in the laboratory during the last seven years, 13 could not be speciated. These 13 strains (Neisseria sp. group) were isolated from the throats of healthy children in Europe and Africa. The Neisseria sp. group oxidized glucose and maltose similarly to N. meningitidis. The observation of polysaccharide synthesis prompted the authors to examine the genomic relationship between the Neisseria sp. group and the type strains of all species of Neisseria and Branhamella. Additional phenotypic characteristics were also examined. Results indicated that the 13 strains in this study belong to the genus Neisseria, in which they constitute one homogenous hybridization group. They belong to the same genospecies as N. gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, N. flavescens and N. lactamica. However, they differ from N. meningitidis in production of polysaccharides, growth requirements and the lack of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity.
TI  - Dihydrofolate reductase from Neisseria sp.
AB  - Members of the genus Neisseria are relatively nonsusceptible to trimethoprim, an  inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. For example, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trimethoprim for N. gonorrhoeae ranges from 2 to 70 mug/ml, whereas the MIC for Escherichia coli is 0.2 mug/ml or less. In an effort to understand this difference, dihydrofolate reductase was partially purified from five Neisseria species and compared with the enzyme from E. coli. N. gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase was similar to that from E. coli in molecular weight (18,000) and affinity for the substrates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and dihydrofolate (K(m) = 13 and 8 muM, respectively). However, the gonococcal enzyme had a decreased affinity for trimethoprim, with an apparent K(i) of 45 x 10(-9) M, some 30-fold greater than the E. coli value of 1.2 x 10(-9) M. These enzymes also differed in their isoelectric points and pH activity profiles. Within the genus Neisseria, the dihydrofolate reductase isolated from N. meningitidis and N. lactamica resembled the N. gonorrhoeae enzyme, and only small differences were detected for the N. flavescens and Branhamella catarrhalis dihydrofolate reductases. These data indicate that the relatively poor affinity of trimethoprim for the dihydrofolate reductase from these organisms may be largely responsible for the relative nonsusceptibility of Neisseria sp. to trimethoprim. The contribution of other resistance mechanisms to the overall nonsusceptibility was assessed. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae with altered cell envelope permeability had MIC values less than twofold different from those of isogenic wild-type strains. Also, a direct relationship was observed between the affinity of trimethoprim analogs for gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase and the MIC of these compounds for the gonococcus. These observations suggest that the cell envelope of N. gonorrhoeae is not impermeable to trimethoprim. Changes in the amount of dihydrofolate reductase activity could cause alterations in the susceptibility of the gonococcus to trimethoprim, as demonstrated with N. gonorrhoeae strains selected for trimethoprim resistance after chemical mutagenesis. However, the level of dihydrofolate reductase activity in wild-type N. gonorrhoeae was similar to that of E. coli, indicating that the difference in the susceptibility of these organisms is not due to greater amounts of enzyme in N. gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus Neisseria.
AB  - Eleven aerobic species of Neisseria, a Mima sp., and a Herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) homology in direct hybridization experiments. DNA labeled with either (14)C or (32)P was prepared from five species of Neisseria. Unlabeled DNA from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled DNA (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 C. The measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous DNA. All serological types of N. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of N. meningitidis with one possible exception, type Z. The genus Neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae; second, N. perflava, N. subflava, N. sicca, N. flavescens, and N. flava; third, N. catarrhalis and N. caviae. Mima and Herellea species show no significant homology with the Neisseria.
