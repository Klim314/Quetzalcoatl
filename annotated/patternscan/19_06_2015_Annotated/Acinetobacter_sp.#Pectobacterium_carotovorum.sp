TI  == degradation of acyl-homoserine lactone molecules by acinetobacter sp. strain c1010.
AB  == a bacterium c1010, isolated from the rhizospheres of cucumbers in fields in korea, degraded the microbial quorum-sensing molecules, hexanoyl homoserine lactone (hhsl), and octadecanoyl homoserine lactone (ohsl). morphological characteristics and 16s rrna sequence analysis identified c1010 as acinetobacter  sp. strain c1010. this strain was able to degrade the acyl-homoserine lactones (ahls) produced by the biocontrol bacterium, pseudomonas chlororaphis o6, and a phytopathogenic bacterium, burkholderia glumae. co-cultivation studies showed that the inactivation of ahls by c1010 inhibited production of phenazines by p. chlororaphis o6. in virulence tests, the c1010 strain attenuated soft rot symptom caused by erwinia carotovora ssp. carotovora. we suggest acinetobacter sp. strain c1010 could be a useful bacterium to manipulate biological functions that are regulated by ahls in various gram-negative bacteria.
