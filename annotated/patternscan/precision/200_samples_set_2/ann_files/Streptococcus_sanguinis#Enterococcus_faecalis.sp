TI  == antimicrobial activity of apitoxin, melittin and phospholipase a(2) of honey bee  (apis mellifera) venom against oral pathogens.
AB  == in this work, we used the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) technique to evaluate the antibacterial potential of the apitoxin produced by apis mellifera bees against the causative agents of tooth decay. apitoxin was assayed in natura  and in the commercially available form. the antibacterial actions of the main components of this apitoxin, phospholipase a2, and melittin were also assessed, alone and in combination. the following bacteria were tested: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, lactobacillus casei,  and enterococcus faecalis. the mic results obtained for the commercially available apitoxin and for the apitoxin in natura were close and lay between 20 and 40 microg / ml, which indicated good antibacterial activity. melittin was the most active component in apitoxin; it displayed very promising mic values, from 4 to 40 microg / ml. phospholipase a2 presented mic values higher than 400 microg / ml. association of mellitin with phospholipase a2 yielded mic values ranging between 6 and 80 microg / ml. considering that tooth decay affects people's health, apitoxin and its component melittin have potential application against oral pathogens.

TI  == isolation of alkaline-tolerant bacteria from primary infected root canals.
AB  == introduction: alkaline-tolerant bacteria in primary infected root canals could have enhanced survival capacity against antimicrobials commonly used in root canal treatment. the aims of this study were to isolate and characterize alkaline-tolerant bacteria before endodontic treatment (s1), after chemomechanical root canal preparation (s2), and after calcium hydroxide dressing (s3). methods: bacteriologic samples were obtained from 43 primary infected root  canals. samples were inoculated into culture media at a ph of 9 and incubated anaerobically. the identities of bacterial isolates were determined by 16s ribosomal rna sequencing. results: all s1 samples were culture positive, with 70% harboring bacteria tolerating a ph of 9. gram-positive bacteria pseudoramibacter  alactolyticus and streptococcus spp were the most frequently isolated strains with a prevalence of 54%. of 13 culture-positive s2 samples, 8 isolates tolerated a ph of 9, namely streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cancerogenus, streptococcus oralis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. seven of these 8 isolates (88%) were correspondingly isolated at s1. all 3 culture-positive s3 samples tolerated a ph of 9, namely s. sanguinis and e. faecalis, which were also isolated in the corresponding s1 and s2 samples. conclusions: we showed that the  presence of alkaline-tolerant streptococcus and enterococcus spp in primary infected root canals could lead to their persistence during and after root canal  treatment and could pose a challenge to current treatment efficacy.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 leader surveillance program.
AB  == the 2013 leader surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the united states. a total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. the groups were staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. the mic90 value for each of the 6  pathogen groups was 1 mug/ml. susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was  99.83%. only 12 isolates (2 s. aureus, 3 staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 streptococcus sanguinis, 5 enterococcus faecium, and 1 enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). three of these (2 s. aureus and 1 e. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. the findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.

TI  == the effect of sodium hypochlorite on enterococcus faecalis when grown on dentine  as a single- and multi-species biofilm.
AB  == enterococcus faecalis is often involved in the aetiology of apical periodontitis  after endodontic treatment. this project aimed to establish, on dentine in vitro, a multi-species biofilm containing e. faecalis, and to determine if the organism  had an increased resistance to sodium hypochlorite compared with an axenic biofilm. biofilms were established on dentine discs in flow cells with either e.  faecalis alone (axenic) or together with fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus sanguinis. following treatment with either 0.9% sodium hypochlorite or saline, the viability of e. faecalis was determined by serial plating and qualitative analysis was performed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. viable counts indicated that 0.9% naocl is highly effective against e. faecalis grown alone and as part of a multi-species biofilm  (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.001, respectively). no significant difference in its survival in the two biofilm types was found (p = 0.8276).

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. methods: microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. the presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (p </= .05). results:  enterococcus faecium (36%), streptococcus epidermidis (36%), eubacterium saburreum (28%), parvimonas micra (28%), streptococcus sanguis (28%), capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), leptotrichia buccalis (28%), enterococcus faecalis (28%), and staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of treponema socranskii (3%), fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). the highest mean levels were found for the following species: e. faecium, dialister pneumosintes, staphylococcus epidermidis and helicobacter pylori. there was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). a  positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the  levels of gram-negative and rod species (p < .05). conclusions: the microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting e. faecium and s. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. no correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical  findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.

TI  == antibacterial effect of iranian green-tea-containing mouthrinse vs chlorhexidine  0.2%: an in vitro study.
AB  == purpose: considering the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties of green tea, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of mouthrinses containing green tea extract vs 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected microorganisms in vitro. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of both mouthrinses and the pure green tea extract was assessed by using disk diffusion and the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) methods against five microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aerogenosa and escherichia coli. growth inhibition zones were measured in mm after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. the two mouthrinses were assessed at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mg/ml to determine the mic, which was interpreted as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: 0.2% chlorhexidine produced a larger zone of growth inhibition than did the mouthrinse made of green tea extract (p < 0.01). paradoxically, the growth inhibition zones  of the tested bacteria were significantly larger in pure extract of green tea than in 0.2% chlorhexidine (p < 0.01). the chlorhexidine mouthrinse inhibited the growth of all tested species and exhibited significantly lower mics than did the  green tea mouthrinse (p < 0.01). conclusions: even though the mouthrinse made with green tea extract presented an in vitro antimicrobial activity inferior to 0.2% chlorhexidine, the pure extract had considerable bactericidal effect.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == [comparison of in vitro antimicrobial activities of bioaggregate and mineral trioxide aggregate].
AB  == treatment outcome of endodontic perforations depends on successful elimination of the associated microorganisms and infected tissues as well as the effective seal  of the root-end or perforation site to prevent future contamination. ideally, perforation repair material has to be bacteriostatic or bactericidal in order to  prevent bacterial contamination as well as good sealing properties and biocompatibility. the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of bioaggregate (ba) and mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) on the standard strains of candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar disc diffusion test. colonies of each strains were harvested from the medium and microorganisms were diluted to obtain a suspension of approximately 108 cfu/ml. petri plates with blood agar base with 5% sheep blood or sabouraud dextrose agar  (for c.albicans) were inoculated with experimental suspensions and ba and mta discs prepared as 2 mm length and 6 mm diameter were placed. after 24 and 48 hours incubation, the diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured. the results of the disc diffusion tests showed that ba and mta were effective on the  tested microorganisms at 24 and 48 hours incubation periods. ba and mta showed similar antimicrobial effects on c.albicans and e.coli. ba was more effective than mta on s.mutans, e.faecalis and p.aeruginosa, however mta was more effective than ba on s.sanguinis at 48 hours. when the time efficiency of the materials were compared, there was no statistically difference between 24 to 48 hours on e.coli, e.faecalis, s.mutans, s.sanguinis in both two groups (p> 0.05). there was statistically significant decrease 24 to 48 hours on c.albicans in ba and mta groups and p.aeruginosa in ba group (p< 0.05). it can be concluded that although  ba and mta displayed similar antimicrobial efficacy on the tested microorganisms  newly improved material ba demonstrated superior antimicrobial activity than other.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == photoactivated disinfection (pad) in endodontics: an in vitro microbiological evaluation.
AB  == purpose: the objective of the present study was the in vitro evaluation by mtt test of the antimicrobial effect of photoactivated disinfection (pad) and, comparatively, of a conventional 5.25% naocl irrigating solution. methods: enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis strains were selected for the test. freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth were endodontically treated, inoculated with bacterial strains and then divided into different groups, each of them treated with pad, with pad plus 0.5% naocl solution, with tbo, with pad for longer time and with 5% naocl solution (positive control). results: the results were significantly different among the various groups, and for enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. pad applied for a longer time (in respect to manufacturer's instructions) or pad associated to 5% naocl showed the significantly higher antibacterial effects.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on different root canal filling materials and sealers.
AB  == introduction: microbial adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation on endodontic root canal filling materials and sealers lead to survival of microorganisms in treated root canals and subsequently to endodontic treatment failures. the present study focused on initial microbial adhesion to different endodontic filling materials. methods: the following endodontic biomaterials were tested: ah-plus, tubli seal, gutta-percha, real seal se, endorez, apexit plus, guttaflow, and dentin. samples of each material were prepared. bovine dentin samples were used as a control. the initial adhesions of salivary bacteria as well as the subsequent single species were quantified by determination of colony-forming units (cfus) and visualized by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy (clsm): enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, and prevotella nigrescens. results: initially adherent microorganisms could be detected and microscopically visualized on each of the materials tested. considering the values of the cfus and the covering grade as detected by clsm, there were significant differences among the materials. fewer bacteria tended to adhere to apexit plus, whereas real seal se and the widely used gutta-percha showed the highest number of adherent bacteria. this tendency was not detected for c. albicans. conclusions: endodontic microorganisms have a high affinity to root canal filling materials and sealers, especially to gutta-percha. because of this high level of bacterial adhesion, subsequent biofilm formation on these materials could be suggested as leading to the persistence of microorganisms in root canals.

TI  == comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == microflora in maxillofacial infections--a changing scenario?
AB  == purpose: advances in isolation and culturing techniques have brought the role of  anaerobic bacteria-causing maxillofacial infections to the fore. recent literature also favors the role of anaerobes in maxillofacial infections. a prospective clinical and microbiological study was designed to check the validity of such claims. patients and methods: this study included 88 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. pus was obtained by aspirating the involved spaces and culture and sensitivity tests were performed to determine the microbes involved and their sensitivity to various antibiotics. results: upon isolating the various organisms causing infection, it was found that 68.2% were aerobes, 13.6% were mixed infections, and 9.1% were anaerobes. streptococcus and peptostreptococcus species were the most common among aerobes and anaerobes, respectively. on determining sensitivity to penicillin, 81.3% were sensitive and  18.8% were resistant. coagulase-negative staphylococcus and staphylococcus aureus were predominantly resistant to penicillin. conclusion: analysis of the results indicated no change in microflora-causing infections in the maxillofacial region  and penicillin remains the drug of choice in treating these infections.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == increased d-lactic acid intestinal bacteria in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
AB  == patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (cfs) are affected by symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and neurological impairment, the cause of which has yet to  be elucidated. however, these symptoms are strikingly similar to those of patients presented with d-lactic acidosis. a significant increase of gram positive facultative anaerobic faecal microorganisms in 108 cfs patients as compared to 177 control subjects (p<0.01) is presented in this report. the viable count of d-lactic acid producing enterococcus and streptococcus spp. in the faecal samples from the cfs group (3.5 x 10(7) cfu/l and 9.8 x 10(7) cfu/l respectively) were significantly higher than those for the control group (5.0 x 10(6) cfu/l and 8.9 x 10(4) cfu/l respectively). analysis of exometabolic profiles of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguinis, representatives of enterococcus and streptococcus spp. respectively, by nmr and hplc showed that these organisms produced significantly more lactic acid (p<0.01) from (13)c-labeled glucose, than the gram negative escherichia coli. further, both e.  faecalis and s. sanguinis secrete more d-lactic acid than e. coli. this study suggests a probable link between intestinal colonization of gram positive facultative anaerobic d-lactic acid bacteria and symptom expressions in a subgroup of patients with cfs. given the fact that this might explain not only neurocognitive dysfunction in cfs patients but also mitochondrial dysfunction, these findings may have important clinical implications.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a new resin-based endodontic sealer against endodontic pathogens.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial activities of a new resin-based superbond (sb) sealer and five other sealers/cements against endodontic pathogens. the antimicrobial activities of sb sealer, sealapex, ah plus, roeko seal automix, canals n, and proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta)  were examined using a double-layered method. the microorganisms staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis were used. live microorganisms were stained using triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the zones of inhibition of microorganism growth were measured. the antimicrobial activity of sb sealer was significantly lower than that of the other sealers, except for pro root mta, against s. aureus, c. albicans, s. mutans, and s. sanguinis, but no activity against e. faecalis was detected. on the other hand, ah plus exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity. pro root mta showed no antimicrobial activity against any of the microorganisms tested. sb sealer offered no antimicrobial advantage over the other sealers tested except for pro root mta.

TI  == an agar diffusion comparison of the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide at  five different concentrations with three different vehicles.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if varying the percent (by weight) of  aqueous calcium hydroxide or using different vehicles had an effect on its antibacterial efficacy against common endodontic pathogens in a pour plate/traditional streak agar diffusion model. mixtures of calcium hydroxide powder and sterile saline in 40, 50 and 60 percent concentrations and the commercial preparations ultracal xs and vitapex were tested against six known endodontic pathogens with an agar diffusion method. each medicament was placed in one of five wells, in each of 10 agar plates (n = 10), for cultures of each bacterial species. zones of inhibition were measured after 48 hours incubation for aerobes and 96 hours incubation for anaerobes. multiple one-way analyses of variance and post-hoc student neuman keuls evaluated the data at alpha = 0.05. larger zones of inhibition were consistently observed for higher concentrations of calcium hydroxide with statistical significance among the bacteria, particularly between 40% and 60%. vitapex had significantly smaller zones of inhibition than all other medicaments and 35% ultracal xs with methylcellulose was nearly as effective as 50% ca(oh)(2) in inhibitory activity. formulations containing 50-60% ca(oh)(2) or 35% ca(oh)(2) with aqueous methylcellulose are recommended as endodontic interappointment medicaments.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect and ph of chlorhexidine gel and calcium hydroxide alone and  associated with other materials.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gluconate gel, calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] and their combination with iodoform and zinc oxide powder as intracanal medications against select microorganisms, and to measure the ph changes caused by these medications. antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method. the zones of  growth inhibition were measured and the results were analyzed statistically by kruskal-wallis test (p<0.05). the ph of the pastes was measured right after preparation, after 24 h and 1 week later. the largest mean zones of microbial inhibition were produced by 2% chx gel, followed by ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + iodoform, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel, ca(oh)2 + 2% chx gel + zinc oxide, and ca(oh)2 +  water. the mean ph of all medications stayed above 12.0 during the whole experiment, except for chx gel (ph=7.0). the results of this study showed that all medications had antimicrobial activity, but the most effective against the tested microorganisms were 2% chx gel, followed by its combination with ca(oh)2 and iodoform.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == antibacterial activity of triterpene acids and semi-synthetic derivatives against oral pathogens.
AB  == triterpene acids (ursolic, oleanoic, gypsogenic, and sumaresinolic acids) isolated from miconia species, along with a mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of maslinic and 2-a-hydroxyursolic acids, as well as ursolic  acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during the evaluation of the antibacterial activity. all the  isolated compounds, mixtures, and semi-synthetic derivatives displayed activity against all the tested bacteria, showing that they are promising antiplaque and anticaries agents. ursolic and oleanolic acids displayed the most intense antibacterial effect, with mic values ranging from 30 microg/ml to 80 microg/ml.  the mic values of ursolic acid derivatives, as well as those obtained for the mixture of ursolic and oleanolic acids showed that these compounds do not have higher antibacterial activity when compared with the activity observed with either ursolic acid or oleanolic acid alone. with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triterpene acids and derivatives, it is suggested that both hydroxy and carboxy groups present in the triterpenes are important for their antibacterial activity against oral pathogens.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

AB  == the antibacterial effects of gray-colored mta (gmta) and white-colored mta (wmta) against enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus sanguis were assessed in vitro using the tube dilution test. broth tubes were prepared and divided into experimental and control groups. aliquots of each of the tested microorganisms were taken from a stock culture and added to each experimental and positive control group. all groups were incubated at 37 degrees c and evaluated for turbidity at 0, 1, 24, 48, and 72-hour time periods. a direct correlation was found between gmta and wmta concentrations and their antibacterial effect. tubes  containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show e. faecalis growth at any of the time periods tested whereas tubes containing wmta showed e. faecalis growth at all concentrations and time periods tested. statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of wmta (p < 0.001). tubes containing gmta in concentrations of 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing wmta in concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/ml did not show s. sanguis growth at any of the time periods  tested. statistically significant differences were found between tubes containing gmta in concentrations 6.25 and 3.12 mg/ml and tubes containing similar concentrations of wmta (p < 0.001). it appears that the susceptibility of e. faecalis and s. sanguis to mta differed and that gmta requires lower concentrations than wmta to exert the same antibacterial effect against each of the microorganisms tested.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == resistance to acidic and alkaline environments in the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background/aims: this study aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanisms employed by the endodontic pathogen enterococcus faecalis to confer acid- and alkali-resistance and to compare these with the mechanisms of representative oral streptococci. methods: e. faecalis jcm8728, streptococcus mutans nctc10449 and streptococcus sanguinis atcc10556 were used to assess both acid- and alkali-resistance by examining: (i) growth in complex media; (ii) stability of intracellular ph (ph(in)); (iii) cell durability to leakage of preloaded bcecf (2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxy-fluorescein); and (iv) cell permeability  to sytox-green. results: growth was initiated by e. faecalis at ph 4.0-11.0, by s. mutans at ph 4.0-9.0 and by s. sanguinis at ph 5.0-9.0. the ph(in) was similar to the extracellular ph in s. mutans and s. sanguinis at ph 5-10, while the ph(in) of e. faecalis was maintained at approximately 7.5-8.5 when extracellular  ph was 7.5-10 and was maintained at levels equivalent to the extracellular ph when ph < 7.5. cell membranes of e. faecalis were resistant to bcecf leakage when extracellular ph was 2.5-12 and to sytox-green permeability at ph 4-10. the cell  membrane durability to extracellular ph in e. faecalis was higher than that observed in the streptococcus strains. conclusion: compared to s. mutans, e. faecalis was found to be equally resistant to acid and more resistant to alkalis. the results suggest that ph-resistance in e. faecalis is attributed to membrane durability against acid and alkali, in addition to cell membrane-bound proton-transport systems. these characteristics may account for why e. faecalis is frequently isolated from acidic caries lesions and from persistently infected  root canals where calcium hydroxide medication is ineffective.

AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == preliminary evaluation of bioactive glass s53p4 as an endodontic medication in vitro.
AB  == calcium hydroxide is the "gold standard" endodontic medication, but it may fail to eliminate certain facultative bacteria and yeasts found in root canal systems. in this study, standardized bovine dentin blocks infected with enterococcus faecalis were treated with an aqueous calcium hydroxide or bioactive glass s53p4  (bag) powder suspension. while calcium hydroxide was ineffective, the bag suspension eliminated the infection in the sampled dentin layers after 5 days. in a direct exposure test, preincubation with human dentin boosted the bag-killing efficacy against e. faecalis atcc29212, candida albicans ccug19915, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc9027, streptococcus sanguis atcc10556, and s. mutans atcc25175. bag placed in the root canals of extracted teeth did not alter root-dentin ph. consequently, the conditions under which the microbiota were killed were not ph-mediated. further studies are ongoing to help clarify the antimicrobial bag effect in the presence of dentin.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == a retrospective investigation of advanced periodontal disease as a risk factor for septicemia in hematopoietic stem cell and bone marrow transplant recipients.
AB  == objective: septicemia is a cause of death in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct) recipients. extraction of teeth with advanced periodontitis has been advocated before hsct to prevent septicemia in myeloablated hosts. the primary aim of the present study was to determine impact of chronic periodontitis, as measured by radiographic alveolar bone loss, on septicemia and transplant mortality. study design: a retrospective design was used to study 77 subjects who received pretransplant dental evaluation, panoramic radiography, and full myeloablative allogeneic hsct to treat hematologic malignancies. radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss was measured with a schei ruler on all teeth. microorganisms isolated from positive blood cultures within the first 100 days after transplant were categorized as of likely origin from periodontal, oral, or  any body sites. spearman correlation and logistic regression analysis assessed associations between positive blood cultures, mean subject whole-mouth percent radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss, and 100-day survival. results: radiographic crestal alveolar bone loss per study subject averaged 13% +/- 7%, with 18.2% exhibiting bone loss of 20% or greater. during the initial 100 days after transplant, 63.6% subjects yielded septicemia-associated positive blood cultures, with staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli as the most common isolates recovered. no statistically significant associations were found between mean subject radiographic alveolar bone loss and septicemia of likely periodontal or oral origin. conclusion: in this preliminary study, no relationship was found between radiographic periodontal status and septicemia or  mortality within the initial 100 days after transplant. a larger-sized, prospective study is warranted to further delineate the risk of septicemia from periodontal and other oral diseases in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

TI  == [therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  == from january 1999 to may 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. they concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. these patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. during 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to  antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. in six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten streptococcus mitis, five s. oralis, two s. sanguis, three s. pneumoniae). a single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. the enterococci were one strain of enterococcus  faecalis and three e. faecium. ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/l of  penicillin g, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = mic < 32 mg/l), and a strain  was resistant (mic = 32 mg/l). eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. for three strains, the mics of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/l and 8-32 mg/l, respectively) were higher. levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. all species were susceptible to glycopeptides. three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. this results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.

TI  == the effect of tissue molecules on bacterial invasion of dentine.
AB  == bacterial invasion of dentinal tubules is a critical step in the pathogenesis of  dental caries and pulp and periapical disease. the purpose of this study was to determine the effect some molecules commonly found in saliva and dentinal tubule  fluid may have on the bacterial invasion of dentine. the results showed that invasion of streptococcus gordonii or enterococcus faecalis cells was inhibited when the bacterial cells were in solution with mucin, immunoglobulin g (igg) and  serum, and this was related to bacterial cell aggregation, as a result of interaction with agglutinins, and/or inhibition of collagen binding. when dentine was soaked in growth media containing fibrinogen, igg, albumin or serum prior to  inoculation, bacterial invasion was inhibited. it is suggested that this may be due to reduced dentine permeability as a consequence of the deposition of the compounds within dentinal tubules.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == vitality status of microorganisms in infected human root dentine.
AB  == aim: this experimental study was initiated to establish a method for characterizing the vitality status of bacteria in infected human root dentine by  differentiating between viable and dead microorganisms. methodology: twenty-four  root segments of extracted human teeth were infected with either streptococcus sanguinis or enterococcus faecalis for 8 weeks. baseline samples from root dentine (rd) were collected after 4 weeks. these were compared with samples taken at week 8 (control group: n = 12) and with samples collected at week 12 after calcium hydroxide treatment for four weeks (test group: n = 12). after marking viable and dead bacterial cells by two fluorescent dyes, the portion of viable bacteria (pvb) was determined, as well as the number of colony-forming units (cfu). results: viable and dead bacteria were identified in all "rd" samples. pvbrd values were lower than pvb values of the bacterial suspension in the root canal lumen. in the control group, pvbrd and cfurd did not markedly differ at week 4 and at week 8, regardless of the strain used. in the test group, viable but non-culturable sanguinis streptococci (mean pvbrd = 27%; cfurd = 0) were detected, despite calcium hydroxide treatment. the viability of e. faecalis was not affected by calcium hydroxide. conclusions: fluorescence labelling of bacteria in human root dentine gives valuable additional information about their  vitality status compared to the parameter cfu. the method may be suitable for following the fate of bacteria in dentinal tubules, for example in the presence of intracanal dressings.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis--a mechanism for its role in endodontic failure.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to identify a possible mechanism that would explain how e. faecalis could survive and grow within dentinal tubules and reinfect an obturated root canal. methodology: cells of streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus mutans ng8, or e. faecalis jh2-2 were grown in brain heart infusion broth containing various amounts of human serum for 56 days. the ability of the three species to invade dentine and bind to immobilized type i collagen in the presence of human serum was assessed by dentine invasion and microtitre well  experiments. results: all three species remained viable over the period of the experiment when grown in human serum. cells of all three bacteria were able to invade dentine and bind to immobilized collagen. both of these properties were inhibited by the presence of collagen in the cell solution. human serum inhibited dentine invasion and collagen adhesion by s. gordonii dl1 and s. mutans ng8, whilst dentine invasion by e. faecalis jh2-2 was reduced in the presence of serum, but not inhibited, and binding to collagen was enhanced. conclusions: it is postulated that a virulence factor of e. faecalis in failed endodontically treated teeth may be related to the ability of e. faecalis cells to maintain the  capability to invade dentinal tubules and adhere to collagen in the presence of human serum.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == the in vitro effects of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate on oral and pharyngeal microorganisms of various ecological niches.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == infective endocarditis: an epidemiological review of 128 episodes.
AB  == objectives: the objective was to determine the current epidemiology of infective  endocarditis. patients and methods: all microbiologically positive episodes of infective endocarditis treated at the university hospital of wales over a 9-year  period from march 1987 to march 1996 was reviewed. patients originated from the catchment area of the university hospital of wales or were referred from other hospitals in wales. data extraction was from records held in the microbiology department and, whenever possible, from patients' casenotes. the epidemiological  parameters were: (1) age and sex of patients; (2) distribution of affected sites; (3) frequency of predisposing risk factors (cardiac and extracardiac); (4) incidence of early prosthetic valve endocarditis; and (5) mortality rates. results: there were 128 microbiologically positive episodes of endocarditis in 125 patients. the mean age of the population was 53.1 years and the aortic valve  was the most frequently involved site of infection (51.6%). a presumed source of  infection was identified in 20% if episodes. the commonest predisposing cardiac risk factor in native valve episodes was bicuspid aortic valve (16.7%) but there  was no identifiable cardiac risk factor in a much larger proportion (37.7%) of native valve episodes. there was a low incidence (0.6%) of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic  valve endocarditis (12.3% and 24.5%) in this study. viridans streptococci were the predominant organisms. in prosthetic valve episodes with onset after the 60th postoperative day but within one postoperative year the identity of the isolate suggested, in most cases, perioperative valve contamination. conclusions: the epidemiology of infective endocarditis has undergone significant change. inability to detect clinically common predisposing lesions, and the frequent absence of any identifiable predisposing cardiac risk factor mean that initial diagnosis is often difficult and demands a high index of suspicion. there was a low incidence of culture positive early prosthetic valve episodes and there were  low mortality rates for both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis; these figures suggest improvements in cardiac care. the microbiological evidence indicates that the duration of the postoperative time period used for classifying prosthetic valve endocarditis into 'early' and 'late' episodes should be extended from 60 days to 1 year.

TI  == cell wall-anchored csha polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  == it has been shown previously that inactivation of the csha gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kda) in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii,  generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. we now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type s. gordonii dl1 (challis) cells, bind csha-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of csha mutants. to more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of  csha, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire csha gene into the replicative plasmid pam401 and expressed full-length csha polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. enterococci expressing csha exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell  surface hydrophobicity over e. faecalis jh2-2 carrying the pam401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. csha expression in e. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind actinomyces naeslundii cells. electron micrographs of negatively stained e. faecalis cells expressing csha showed peritrichous surface  fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control e. faecalis jh2-2(pam401) cells. the fibrils bound csha-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of e. faecalis cells to fibronectin. the results demonstrate that the csha polypeptide  is the structural and functional component of s. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.

AB  == background: infective endocarditis is a systemic disease in which there are a continuously antigenic stimulation of immunologic system. streptococcus is still  the most frequent cause of infective endocarditis. patients and methods: we investigated the presence of antibody (ab), total and igm by indirect immune fluorescence technique, in four groups of population: streptococcal infective endocarditis (sie), streptococcal bacteraemia (sb), staphylococcus aureus endocarditis, and healthy people. antigens used were: 1) their own strain isolated from the blood of patients with sie and sb inverted question markhomologous ab inverted question mark, and; 2) seven species of streptococcus: streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus sanguis ii, nutritional dependent streptococci and enterococcus faecalis (heterologous ab). results: homologous antibodies: titers > or = 1/512 were found in all patients with sie and only in 2 with sb (sensitivity 100% and specificity 93%). igm titer (threshold 1/32) was positive only in patients with sie (sensitivity 75,5% and specificity 100%). the  fall of the ab titer was continuous and slow, despite the good clinical evolution of patients. (ab titers were > or = 1/512 and igm > or = 1/64 in 30% of patients  1 year later). heterologous ab: in spite of statistically significant difference  found in sie versus the other groups, sensitivity of this test (threshold 1/256)  is low, confidence interval include expected random value (50%), specificity is 88%. conclusions: the utility of homologous ab for diagnosing infective endocarditis is demonstrated. on the contrary for heterologous ab, antigenic common fractions must be found in the different species.

TI  == influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (gpb). previous investigations showed that the macrophage  scavenger receptor (sr), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many gpb, possibly via lta. sr binding to other ligands is dependent  upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand.  we therefore investigated sr recognition of lta species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these ltas to compete  with the binding of metabolically labeled sr to beads coated with the known sr ligand polyguanylic acid. staphylococcus aureus lta, a classical lta type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane  diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50) for inhibition of sr binding of 0.84 microg/ml. when the s. aureus lta was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the ic50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. other polyglycerophosphate ltas from enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus hirae, listeria monocytogenes, listeria welshimeri, and streptococcus sanguis showed ic50s of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to sr. accordingly, the zwitterionic lta of streptococcus pneumoniae and clostridium innocuum lta substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. the data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated lta as a major ligand of gpb for binding to sr. whether binding of lta and whole gpb to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.

TI  == identification and characterization of the genes of enterococcus faecalis plasmid pcf10 involved in replication and in negative control of pheromone-inducible conjugation.
AB  == the prgb gene of the enterococcus faecalis pheromone-inducible conjugative plasmid pcf10 encodes the surface protein asc10. this protein mediates cell aggregation and its expression results in high-frequency transfer of the plasmid  from donor to recipient. to identify the minimum region necessary for negative regulation of prgb expression, target plasmids were constructed containing a recently identified positive control region and a prgb::lacz transcriptional fusion; expression of prgb in cells carrying these plasmids was thus verified by  beta-galactosidase assay. the target plasmids were used in genetic studies with compatible plasmids containing cloned pcf10 genes supplying putative negative control functions to define the minimum region of pcf10 required for shutdown of  prgb expression in the absence of exogenous pheromone. the minimum segment required for negative control, as indentified by deletion analysis, was a 6.9-kb  region extending from the 5' end of a gene called prgn, through a previously identified gene, prgx. the dna in this region, which had not been previously characterized (2.85 kb), was sequenced, and several potential regulatory genes and plasmid replication genes were identified. genetic analysis indicated that the prgn, -y, and -x genes are involved in negative control; prgw may also play a role in negative control, since it appeared to be required for expression of prgy. prgx, or a closely adjacent dna sequence, acted in cis. the region of pcf10 containing negative control genes was also shown to function as an autonomous replicon in e. faecalis.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg (atcc 53103) on the growth of streptococcus sobrinus in vitro.
AB  == lactobacillus gg, a recently characterized l. rhamnosus gg strain (atcc 53103), has been shown to exert inhibitory activity against a variety of bacterial species, including streptococci. we isolated and studied the effect of the inhibitory substance of lactobacillus gg on some oral streptococci. the inhibitory activity of the isolated substance was weak, but some growth inhibition was observed in streptococcus sobrinus pretreated with the substance in comparison with untreated controls. zones of growth inhibition on agar plates  were apparent only at ph values below 5, indicating that the inhibitory activity  was restricted to a low ph range. growth curve experiments showed a statistically significant inhibition between series with and without the isolated substance (p  < 0.05). the ultrastructure of s. sobrinus was not affected when treated with the inhibitory substance. the lactobacillus gg itself did not ferment sucrose. the results offer interesting perspectives for future research focusing on the protective function of normal flora and in the attempt to replace harmful bacterial species in oral microflora with less harmful ones.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == [immunological analysis of streptococcus sanguis antigens].
AB  == the exact cause of behcet's disease is still unknown. recently, advanced bacterial studies revealed that behcet's disease was related to streptococcus (s.) sanguis. however, the antigenicity of s. sanguis has not been fully studied. in this study, we clarified the antigenicity of s. sanguis. we made s. sanguis antigens: mechanical braun extract (mbe) and crude cell wall (ccw) from the whole cells, membrane fraction (mf) and cytoplasmic fraction (cf) from mbe, cell wall fragment (cwf) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from mbe. we found that the major antigenicity of s. sanguis was present in cf by use of the ouchterlony method and the elisa method. however, apart from s. pyogenes, we could not recognize a common antigenicity among s. sanguis and several other antigens, such as s-ag, irbp, retinal soluble fraction, retinal insoluble fraction and enterococcus faecalis, by the ouchterlony method. since we have clarified the antigenicity of  s. sanguis in this study, we can now perform detailed examinations with samples from patients with behcet's disease for s. sanguis antigens.

TI  == enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  == enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in  france, the uk and the usa. all such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. the mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. that the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of streptococcus sanguis challis has been reported. the structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal dna. the plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some dna sequence homology.

TI  == [studies on delayed skin reactivity to streptococci in behcet's disease].
AB  == delayed type hypersensitivity of patients with behcet's disease was investigated  by intradermal skin test and prick test, using various inactivated microorganisms as antigens. in the intradermal skin test, 13 patients showed significantly increased skin reactivity to e. faecalis, compared with 5 normal controls. no significant differences were observed between these two groups in terms of reaction to s. pyogenes. prick test was performed in 11 patients and 6 controls,  using s. pyogenes, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and e. faecalis as antigens. it was  shown that patients with this disease had significantly greater skin reactions to crude cell wall antigens, as well as to whole cell antigens of these streptococci than the controls. the antigenicity of streptococci seemed to be present mainly in the cell wall fragment, and these streptococci seemed to have cross reactivity with each other. these results suggest that streptococci may have some significant role in the immunopathogenesis of this disease.

AB  == rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were challenged intravenously with  various inoculum sizes of tolerant streptococcus sanguis or streptococcus faecalis. single-dose amoxicillin (40 mg/kg) was given intravenously either 30 min before or 30-240 min after bacterial challenge. prophylaxis of endocarditis against both strains was successful when the inocula used for challenge were in the range of the minimum inoculum producing bacterial endocarditis in 90% of control animals (id90) but was less effective or failed with larger inocula or when amoxicillin administration was delayed up to 240 min after bacterial challenge with s. sanguis. in a group of rats profoundly depleted of neutrophils  by a rabbit anti-rat neutrophil serum given 30 min after challenge with s. faecalis at id90, single-dose amoxicillin administered simultaneously with the antiserum was protective, indicating that neutrophils were not required for successful endocarditis prophylaxis.

AB  == the efficacy of daptomycin (ly146032), a vancomycinlike lipopeptide antibiotic, was compared with that of antibiotics commonly in use for prevention and treatment of experimental aortic valve endocarditis in rabbits. strains of staphylococcus aureus. s. epidermidis, streptococcus sanguis, and enterococcus faecalis were used to establish endocarditis. a single 10-mg/kg dose of daptomycin and a single 25-mg/kg dose of vancomycin were both effective in prevention of endocarditis produced by strains of s. aureus and s. sanguis. daptomycin was more effective than vancomycin for prevention of endocarditis caused by the strain of s. epidermidis. a single dose of daptomycin also was more effective in prevention of staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis than were single-dose regimens of cefazolin (100 mg/kg) and the combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg) plus gentamicin (3 mg/kg), respectively. for treatment of endocarditis, daptomycin (10 mg/kg) as a single daily dose was as effective as regimens of either vancomycin or beta-lactam antibiotics for staphylococcal and enterococcal endocarditis. daptomycin, however, was not as effective as a single  daily dose of 600,000 u of procaine penicillin for endocarditis caused by the strain of s. sanguis.

TI  == saliva-mediated aggregation of enterococcus faecalis transformed with a streptococcus sanguis gene encoding the ssp-5 surface antigen.
AB  == the interaction of a high-molecular-weight salivary glycoprotein (agglutinin) with streptococcus sanguis m5 leads to the formation of bacterial aggregates. we  have previously shown that the ssp-5 surface antigen from s. sanguis m5 binds the salivary agglutinin and therefore may be involved in the aggregation process. here we report the transformation of a nonaggregating enterococcus faecalis strain with the ssp-5 gene and show that the protein is expressed on the cell surface and confers an aggregation-positive phenotype. e. faecalis s161 protoplasts were transformed with pam401 eb-5, a shuttle vector containing the s. sanguis ssp-5 gene, resulting in the isolation of e. faecalis s161eb-5. crude cell extracts from this transformant and from s. sanguis m5 were analyzed by western blotting. extracts from s. sanguis m5 possessed peptides of 190 and 205 kilodaltons that reacted strongly with polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant ssp-5 antigen. e. faecalis s161eb-5 contained only the 190-kilodalton immunoreactive protein, suggesting that the antigen may be processed differently  in e. faecalis s161eb-5. the parent strain, e. faecalis s161, did not react with  this antibody preparation. immunogold labeling of intact e. faecalis s161eb-5 and s. sanguis m5 with anti-ssp-5 immunoglobulin g showed that both organisms expressed similar levels of the antigen. both organisms formed visible aggregates upon incubation with salivary agglutinin. these results suggest that the ssp-5 antigen may mediate both the binding of agglutinin to s. sanguis m5 and the subsequent formation of bacterial aggregates.

TI  == dna probe for identification of streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == enterococcus faecium bm4165 and bm4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (ly146032). strain bm4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin b-type (mls) antibiotics. the genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to mls antibiotics in strain bm4165 were carried  on plasmids pip819 and pip821, respectively; pip819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to mls antibiotics. the two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other e. faecium strains. plasmid pip819 could also conjugate to e. faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, s. pyogenes, s. lactis, and listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to s. aureus. glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and production of inhibitory substances among bacterial strains isolated from the oral cavities of balb/c mice.
AB  == in the oral cavities of balb/c mice, microbial population levels are regulated by multifactorial processes. factors include the production of inhibitory substances and the exchange of genetic material. in this work, 371 isolates from different sites (saliva, tongue, teeth, and mucosa) of the oral cavities of balb/c mice were screened for resistance to antibiotics and antimicrobial activity. antibiotic-resistant strains represented 25% of the total flora. among the predominant species, all the s. faecalis isolates showed multiresistance, and 23% of the lactobacillus murinus isolates and 15% of the staphylococcus aureus were resistant to at least one antibiotic. resistance to aminoglycosides (neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) was most frequently encountered. in s. faecalis, high levels of resistance were recorded to neomycin and streptomycin but not to gentamicin or kanamycin. macrolides (m), lincosamides (l), streptogramin b (s), tetracycline (tc), and chloramphenicol (cm) resistance was also present in multiresistance patterns, especially among s. faecalis isolates.  hemolytic (hly+) streptococci were less resistant to mls, tc, and cm than were non-hemolytic (hly-) isolates. resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was detected only among staphylococci and with a low prevalence (4%). the frequencies of strains producing antimicrobial substances against the indicator strains (s. mutans lg-1, s. sanguis ny 101, and a. viscosus ny 1) were high for l. murinus (76%) and s. faecalis (57% for hly- and 90% for hly+), but low for s. aureus (7%). these results indicate that the indigenous oral flora could interfere with  colonization by allochthonous micro-organisms and that resistance patterns should be taken into account for the elimination of the oral indigenous flora by antibiotic treatment.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == evidence for natural gene transfer from gram-positive cocci to escherichia coli.
AB  == high-level resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin type b (mls) antibiotics in escherichia coli bm2570 is due to the presence on the conjugative  plasmid pip1527 of the mls resistance determinant ermbc, which is almost identical to the erm genes previously described in plasmid pam77 from streptococcus sanguis (ermam) and in transposon tn917 from enterococcus faecalis  (ermb). this gene and its regulatory region are located downstream from the insertion sequence is1. the 23s rrna methylase encoded by pip1527 differs by three and six amino acids from those encoded by tn917 and pam77, respectively. unlike the streptococcal elements which confer the inducible mls phenotype, the ermbc gene is expressed constitutively in e. coli and bacillus subtilis, due to several mutations in the regulatory region. transcription of the ermbc gene starts from three different sites following three overlapping promoters which function in both e. coli and b. subtilis. promoters p2 and p3 are located within  the region homologous to pam77 and tn917, and p1 is a hybrid promoter constituted by -35 and -10 sequences located at the end of is15 and in the streptococcal region, respectively. these results constitute evidence for the recent in vivo transfer from streptococcus spp. to e. coli. this transfer could have been mediated by transposons such as tn917 or tn1545 from streptococcus pneumoniae, which also bears an mls determinant that is homologous to ermb. we speculate that the insertion sequences is15 and is1 could have played a role in the expression and dissemination of ermbc, which has been found in numerous strains of enterobacteria.

TI  == comparison of single and multiple doses of prophylactic antibiotics in experimental streptococcal endocarditis.
AB  == single-doses or short-term administration of beta-lactam antibiotics alone or combined with aminoglucoside antibiotics have failed to consistently prevent experimental streptococcal endocarditis induced by high inocula of bacteria poorly susceptible to killing by these antibiotics. the optimal duration of administration of antibiotics for successful prophylaxis under these circumstances has not been established. we therefore tested, in rats with catheter-induced sterile aortic vegetations, the duration of administration of antibiotic necessary to prevent endocarditis induced by bacterial inocula 100 to  10,000 times the 90% infective dose of two tolerant viridans-group streptococci and two streptococcus faecalis strains. multiple-dose regimens of amoxicillin alone or of amoxicillin combined with gentamicin were studied. against the two viridans group streptococci, successful prophylaxis was achieved with multiple doses of amoxicillin alone given over 24 to 48 hr and by the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin given for 6 to 24 hr. against the two s. faecalis strains, multiple-dose regimens with amoxicillin alone failed, but the combination of amoxicillin and gentamicin was successful when administered for 48 to 72 hr. thus, after challenge with high bacterial inocula, repeated doses of a  beta-lactam antibiotic alone were sufficient to prevent viridans streptococcal endocarditis, but multiple doses of a bactericidal combination (beta-lactam plus  aminoglucoside), as necessary for the treatment of established endocarditis, were a prerequisite for successful prophylaxis of s. faecalis endocarditis.

TI  == reconstitution of atp-dependent calcium transport from streptococci.
AB  == membrane vesicles of three streptococcal strains (streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus lactis, and streptococcus sanguis) were extracted with octyl-beta-d-glucoside in the presence of escherichia coli lipid and glycerol. for reconstitution, the detergent extract was mixed with bath-sonicated e. coli lipid, in the presence of octyl-beta-d-glucoside, and proteoliposomes were formed by a 25-fold dilution. atp-dependent calcium accumulation by proteoliposomes was  comparable to that found in parent vesicles. recovery of this calcium transport activity was dependent on the inclusion of an osmolyte protein stabilant (glycerol, etc.) during solubilization. the properties of atp-driven calcium transport were studied in the reconstituted system. in proteoliposomes, atp-linked calcium accumulation was not affected by the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, or by the ionophores, valinomycin and  nigericin, in the presence of potassium, or by n,n'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an  inhibitor of the f0f1-atpase. on the other hand, calcium transport was completely blocked by micromolar levels of orthovanadate; half-maximal inhibitions were observed at 0.4, 4, and 4 microm vanadate, for s. faecalis, s. lactis, and s. sanguis, respectively. this marked sensitivity to orthovanadate suggests operation of an e1e2-type ion-motive pump. these data demonstrate that, in a reconstituted system, calcium transport is not linked to an atp-dependent proton  circulation via the f0f1-atpase, but rather is driven by a calcium-translocating  atpase. thus, calcium extrusion from the cytosol of enteric, lactic acid, or oral streptococci is mediated by an atp-linked process analogous to the ion-motive atpases of eukaryotic membranes.

TI  == identification of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for salivary agglutinins.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterize a fraction from oral streptococci containing receptor activity for salivary agglutinin molecules. several species and strains of streptococci were disrupted in a ribi press. the supernatant was nuclease-treated and subjected to differential centrifugation. receptor activity  in the fractions was measured by the inhibition of saliva-mediated bacterial aggregation. in addition, bacterial strains were tested for their ability to aggregate and to deplete saliva of agglutinin activity. three patterns of activity were observed: streptococcus sanguis m5 depleted saliva of agglutinin activity and aggregated well; streptococcus sanguis cc5a depleted saliva of agglutinin but did not aggregate well; and streptococcus faecalis s-161 neither depleted saliva of agglutinin nor did it aggregate. the 105,000 g supernatant fractions derived from ribi-disrupted streptococcus sanguis m5 and cc5a, but not  from streptococcus faecalis, showed dose-dependent inhibition of saliva-mediated  aggregation. this inhibitory activity was non-dialyzable, had the same heat and trypsin sensitivity as that seen with intact bacteria, and was not due to enzymatic digestion of the salivary agglutinin. iso-electric focusing revealed a  single active region with a pi of 5.5 which was clearly separated from the bulk of the bacterial proteins.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis r plasmid pjh1 contains a pam alpha 1 delta 1-like replicon.
AB  == streptococcus faecalis r plasmid pjh1 did not transform competent strains of streptococcus sanguis. a hybrid plasmid, pdl310, consisting of virtually all of the s. faecalis hemolysin-bacteriocin plasmid pjh2 and a segment of pjh1 dna that included the tetracycline resistance determinant, yielded tetracycline-resistant  transformants at a frequency of less than 10(-8) transformants per cfu, when it was added to a competent culture of s. sanguis wicky. four of the transformants contained a 4.7-kilobase plasmid (pdl316) that transformed strain wicky at a frequency of 8.6 x 10(-8). restriction endonuclease digests, agarose gel electrophoresis, and southern blot hybridizations indicated that pdl316 consisted entirely of pjh1-derived dna. additional restriction studies, southern blot hybridizations, and heteroduplex analyses indicated that pdl316 was very closely  related to 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid pam alpha 1 delta 1, a derivative of 9.0-kilobase s. faecalis plasmid pam alpha 1.

TI  == comparison of single doses of amoxicillin or of amoxicillin-gentamicin for the prevention of endocarditis caused by streptococcus faecalis and by viridans streptococci.
AB  == recent recommendations for the prophylaxis of endocarditis in humans have advocated single doses or short courses of antibiotic combinations (beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for susceptible patients in whom enterococcal bacteremia might develop or for patients at especially high risk of developing endocarditis  (e.g., patients with prosthetic cardiac valves). we tested the prophylactic efficacy (in rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations) of single doses of amoxicillin plus gentamicin against challenge with various streptococcal strains  (two strains of streptococcus faecalis, one of streptococcus bovis, and three of  viridans streptococci); we then compared this efficacy with that of single doses  of amoxicillin alone. successful prophylaxis against all six strains was achieved with single doses of both amoxicillin alone and amoxicillin plus gentamicin. this protection, however, was limited, for both regimens, to the lowest bacterial-inoculum size producing endocarditis in 90% of control rats and was not extended to higher inocula by using the combination of antibiotics. we concluded  that a single dose of amoxicillin alone was protective against enterococcal and nonenterococcal endocarditis in the rat, but that its efficacy was limited and could not be improved by the simultaneous administration of gentamicin.

TI  == antistreptococcal activity of sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of sch 34343 was compared with that of penicillin and cefotaxime against clinical isolates of streptococci. sch 34343 was highly active against streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans streptococci, streptococci of groups a, b, c and g, and str. bovis. ninety per cent of these strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25, less than or equal to 0.12 and less than or equal to  0.06 mg/l of sch 34343, penicillin and cefotaxime respectively. activity of sch 34343 against str. faecalis was only moderate. sch 34343 had very good bactericidal activity against group b streptococci, and showed high mbc/mic ratios against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and str. faecalis. sch 34343, 20 mg/l, and gentamicin, 4 mg/l, were synergistic against both of the penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci, and one-third of the str. faecalis strains.

TI  == bactericidal activity of human lysozyme, muramidase-inactive lysozyme, and cationic polypeptides against streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus faecalis: inhibition by chitin oligosaccharides.
AB  == the basis of the bactericidal activity of human lysozyme against streptococcus sanguis was studied. experiments were designed to evaluate the role of lysozyme muramidase activity in its bactericidal potency. inactivation of the muramidase activity of lysozyme was achieved by reduction of essential disulfides with dithiothreitol (dtt) or by incubation with the chitin oligosaccharides chitotriose and chitobiose. muramidase-inactive lysozyme, prepared by reduction with dtt, was equal in bactericidal potency to native lysozyme. solutions of native chicken egg white lysozyme and human lysozyme exhibited equal bactericidal potency yet differed ca. fourfold with respect to lytic (muramidase) activity. the above results suggested that the bactericidal activity of lysozyme is not dependent upon muramidase activity. chitotriose and chitobiose were found to inhibit both lytic and bactericidal activities of lysozyme. the bactericidal activity of muramidase-inactive lysozyme (reduction with dtt) was also inhibited  by chitotriose and chitobiose. further investigations demonstrated that chitotriose and chitobiose were also potent inhibitors of the bactericidal activity of the cationic homopolypeptides poly-l-arginine and poly-d-lysine. these latter results suggested that the essential bactericidal property of lysozyme was its extreme cationic nature and that some bacterial endogenous activities, inhibitable by chitotriose and chitobiose, were essential for expression of the bactericidal activity of either native or muramidase-inactive lysozyme or of the cationic homopolypeptides. experiments with streptococcus faecalis whole cells, cell walls, and crude autolysin preparations implicated endogenous autolytic muramidases as the bacterial targets of chitotriose and chitobiose. the essentially identical responses of s. sanguis and s. faecalis to  chitotriose in bactericidal assays with muramidase-inactive lysozyme and polylysine suggested that muramidase-like enzymes exist in s. sanguis and, furthermore, play an essential role in cationic protein-induced loss of viability of the oral microbe.

TI  == streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cam373) also produced by staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (tn918).
AB  == streptococcus faecalis rc73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pam373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cam373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. the pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22  coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. streptococcus sanguis challis and g9b  also produced the activity, but 10 other streptococcus sanguis strains did not. the activity was also produced by streptococcus faecium 9790. a tetracycline resistance (tc) determinant present in s. faecalis rc73 was not associated with pam373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pam373 among other plasmids present in the strain. analyses of the tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to tn916. designated tn918, the  transposon could insert into pam373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. whereas pam373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus sanguis. however, a derivative of pam373 carrying tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.

TI  == molecular cloning of a pip501 derivative yields a model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation.
AB  == we have previously constructed a derivative of the broad host range streptococcal plasmid pip501, a conjugative plasmid designated pva797, that confers chloramphenicol resistance and contains a unique ecori site in a non-essential region of the plasmid molecule. pva797 (30.7 kb) when cloned in toto as an ecori  fragment into the positive selection vector pop203(a2+) gave a recombinant, pva904 (37.7 kb), which was able to replicate in escherichia coli and in streptococcal species. it can be phenotypically monitored in either genus by specific drug resistance markers (chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci, tetracycline resistance in e. coli). pva904 segregates into e. coli minicells where it specifies the production of at least 13 polypeptides. many of the polypeptides are missing in minicells containing a transfer-defective, deletion derivative of pva904. pva904 is an ideal model replicon for the study of streptococcal conjugation because it is a shuttle plasmid thus enabling manipulation using procedures established for e. coli. specifically, it should be possible to define the genetic basis of streptococcal conjugation by coupling mutagenesis protocols and minicell protein analyses in e. coli with evaluation of transfer function in streptococci.

TI  == return of streptococcus faecalis dna cloned in escherichia coli to its original host via transformation of streptococcus sanguis followed by conjugative mobilization.
AB  == cloning vectors were introduced into streptococcus faecalis by conjugation. a conjugative plasmid (pva797) and cloning vector pva838 recombined in streptococcus sanguis at homologous sequences, forming a cointegrate. the pva797::pva838 cointegrate transferred to s. faecalis by conjugation. recombination between homologous sequences resolved the cointegrate in the s. faecalis transconjugants, and pva797 and pva838 segregated because of incompatibility. s. faecalis strains that received pva838 by this mechanism contained plasmids indistinguishable from authentic pva838 from escherichia coli. other plasmids, including pva736, were introduced into s. faecalis by this method. this approach should facilitate the introduction of cloned dna into s. faecalis.

TI  == physical and genetic analyses of streptococcal plasmid pam beta 1 and cloning of  its replication region.
AB  == plasmid pam beta 1, originally isolated from streptococcus faecalis ds5, mediates resistance to the mls (macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b alpha) group of antibiotics. a restriction endonuclease map of the 26.5-kilobase (kb) pam beta 1 molecule was constructed by using the enzymes avai, hpaii, ecori, pvuii, kpn1,  bsteii, hpai, hhai, and hindiii. a comparison of this map to those of four independently isolated deletion derivatives of pam beta 1 located the mls resistance determinant within a 2-kb dna segment and at least one conjugative function within an 8-kb region. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was ligated onto the 4.0-kb escherichia coli plasmid vector, packc1, and used to transform e. coli hb101. the 9.0-kb chimeric plasmid was then used to transform streptococcus sanguis challis with concurrent expression of the e. coli kanamycin resistance determinant. the 5.0-kb ecori-b fragment from pam beta 1 was subsequently used as a vector to clone a streptomycin resistance determinant from a strain of streptococcus mutans containing no detectable plasmid dna. subcloning experiments, using a hindiii partial digest of pam beta 1 dna, narrowed the replication region of this plasmid to a 2.95-kb fragment.

TI  == streptococcal r plasmid pip501: endonuclease site map, resistance determinant location, and construction of novel derivatives.
AB  == the streptococcal resistance plasmid pip501 (30 kilobase pairs [kb]) encodes resistance to chloramphenicol (cmr) and erythromycin (emr) and is capable of conjugative transfer among numerous streptococcal species. by using a streptococcal host-vector recombinant dna system, the cmr and emr determinants of pip501 were localized to 6.3-kb hindiii and 2.1-kb hindiii-avai fragments, respectively. pip501 was lost at a frequency of 22% in streptococcus sanguis cells grown at 42 degrees c but was stable in cells grown at 37 degrees c (less than 1% frequency of loss). sequences from a cryptic multicopy plasmid, pva380-1, were substituted for the pip501 emr determinant in vitro, and the resulting recombinant plasmid, designated pva797, was recovered in transformed s. sanguis cells. the replication of pva797 was governed by the pva380-1 sequences based on  temperature-stable replication and incompatibility with pva380-1-derived replicons. the self-ligation of partially cleaved hindiii pip501 dna fragments allowed the localization of a pip501 region involved in autonomous plasmid replication. a small pip501 derivative (pva798) obtained from this experiment had a greatly increased copy number but was unstably inherited. our data indicate that the sequences encoding the resistance determinants and some of the plasmid replication machinery are relatively clustered on the pip501 molecule. the properties of pva797 and pva798 indicate that these molecules will enhance current streptococcal genetic systems from the standpoint of conjugative mobilization (pva797) and gene amplification (pva798).

AB  == immune complexes from patients with subacute endocarditis were used to develop a  methodology for characterization of the antigen involved in human circulating immune complexes. this model was chosen because it permits isolation of the causative agent of the streptococcal infection thought to contain the antigen present in the immune complex. a comparison was made between two methods for characterization of bacterial antigen bound to antibody. in the first, animals were immunized with purified immune complexes and the production of antistreptococcal antibodies was investigated. in the second method, a sandwich elisa was developed, implying the double specificity of the immune complex (human immunoglobulin and streptococcal antigen). the latter method gave the best results, detecting antigen in the immune complexes of 8 out of 10 patients' sera. the application of this method to other immunopathological situations is discussed.

TI  == bacterial adhesion in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. effect of subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations on streptococcal adhesion in vitro and the development of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (nbte) is important in the pathogenesis of endocarditis. subinhibitory concentrations (submic) of some antibiotics decrease bacterial adhesion to epithelial cells in vitro. we utilized an in vitro assay system to study the effect of submic of various antibiotics on streptococcal adhesion to a fibrin-platelet matrix (simulating nbte). the results were (a) bacterial adhesion of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus faecalis to nbte was significantly reduced by vancomycin, penicillin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and streptomycin (p less than 0.01 vs. controls) but not rifampin or trimethoprimsulfametrole; (b) the effect was dose-dependent and increased with duration of exposure to antibiotic; (c) reduction in bacterial adhesion did not correlate with altered retention by hydrophobic-interaction chromatography. this reduction in adhesion correlated with a diminished capacity of submic exposed streptococcus sanguis (1/4 vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) x 4 h) to produce endocarditis in vivo. after intravenous inoculation of 10(6) colony-forming units of preincubated organisms into rabbits with traumatized aortic valves, 6 of 22 developed endocarditis vs. 17 of 22 controls (p = 0.03). these results may be relevant to prophylaxis of endocarditis since exposure of bacteria to submic of various antibiotics may reduce bacterial adherence both, to mucosal surfaces, and to damaged cardiac valves.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.
