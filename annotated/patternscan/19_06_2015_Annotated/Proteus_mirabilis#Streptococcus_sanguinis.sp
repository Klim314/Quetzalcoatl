TI  == [brain abscesses after extracranial infections of the head and neck area].
AB  == the authors report on 20 immunocompetent patients with brain abscess after 12 cases of middle ear, seven tooth and a single frontal sinus infection. the clinical aspects, hematochemical and microbiological data, the role of imaging diagnostics (ct, mr) and the type of treatment are analysed. neurosurgery was performed on 17 patients (85%), eight of whom subsequently underwent evacuation of the primary source of infection (four mastoidectomies, two timpanoplasties, two tooth extractions). mastoidectomy was eventually carried out on one of the three patients who did not undergo neurosurgery. microbiological diagnosis was possible in nine patients through culture examination: proteus mirabilis in three cases, peptostreptococcus sp. in two, micrococcus varians, proteus vulgaris, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus viridans not typed in single cases. the pus was sterile in eight patients (47.1% of those operated). an association of two antimicrobial agents was used in 18 patients, while in two cases monotherapy  was preferred, based on the isolated bacteria. treatment lasted on average 38 days. the most frequently used therapy regimen (75%) was the association of a beta-lactam drug with chloramphenicol or metronidazole. therapy was successful in 19/20 patients; one patient died. there was no significant difference in prognostic terms with regard to sex, age, duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, clinical picture at onset, number and size of abscesses or type of treatment. recognising the first clinical signs and symptoms (headache, fever, alterations in consciousness, focal neurological deficit, epileptic seizures) is  extremely important for prompt diagnosis of brain abscess.

TI  == [bact-alert system for hemocultures: evaluation of terminal subcultures].
AB  == few laboratory microbiological procedures are as important as the isolation of microorganisms from blood. to evaluate the usefulness of the terminal subcultures, 5669 blood cultures giving negative results after 7 days of incubation in the bact/alert system (organon teknika) were studied. bottles were  distributed as follows: 1562 adult aerobic bottles, 119 adult anaerobic bottles,  3960 pediatric bottles and 28 fan bottles. from 5669 blood cultures, 10 subcultures that yielded growth had not been detected by the system. these included 5 adult aerobic bottles and 5 pediatric bottles, 7 of these microorganisms were considered contaminants according to clinical data (2 micrococcus spp, 1 staphylococci coagulase negative, 1 burkholderia cepacia, 1 peptoestreptococcus spp, 1 corynebacterium spp, 1 scedosporium spp) while the other 3 were considered true bacteremia (1 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 streptococcus sanguis), although no one made any change in treatment on the basis of the previous isolation. based on these results the routinary utilization of terminal subcultures is not advisable and should be used only for  special cases or a second system of blood culture should be added according to clinical or epidemiological data.

TI  == cerebrospinal fluid broth culture isolates: their significance for antibiotic treatment.
AB  == enriched broth medium is routinely used as a supplement for agar plate culture of cerebrospinal fluid (csf). to assess the clinical utility of broth cultures, 151  consecutive csf bacterial and fungal isolates obtained from 91 patients were retrospectively reviewed for the effect of results on treatment. treatment decisions associated with individual csf specimens for which isolates were recovered from thioglycollate broth only were compared with the treatment decisions associated with csf specimens for which isolates were recovered by agar plate culture. treatment was defined as initiation of or change in antimicrobial  therapy based on the reporting of csf culture isolates. thirty-six (24%) of the 151 isolates were recovered in broth only. three (8%) of these 36 isolates (from  34 patients) resulted in treatment with antimicrobial agents; however, 2 of the 3 treated isolates (candida tropicalis, proteus mirabilis) were recovered from a second csf specimen in agar plate culture within 24 hours. thus, only a single isolate (3%; staphylococcus epidermidis) was treated based solely on a positive broth culture result. in contrast, 60 (52%) of the 115 isolates recovered in agar plate culture from 23 (40%) of 57 patients were treated (staphylococci, 28; gram-negative bacilli, 14; cryptococcus neoformans, 10; streptococcus pneumoniae, 3; streptococcus sanguis, 1; other, 4). we conclude that treatment with antimicrobial agents based on isolates recovered from csf specimens in broth culture alone is infrequent and infer from the data that the use of csf broth cultures contributes little to treatment decisions.

TI  == novel shuttle vectors for improved streptokinase expression in streptococci and bacterial l-forms.
AB  == novel shuttle vectors of small size and increased copy number capable of replication in escherichia coli, l-forms of proteus mirabilis, and streptococci were constructed from a streptococcal erythromycin-resistant plasmid and an escherichia coli phasmid. the streptokinase gene, skc, was inserted into one of them, and skc expression was studied in streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus lactis, and in an l-form strain (lvi) of proteus mirabilis. the new streptokinase shuttle plasmid, pmls10 (7.3 kb), specified higher skc yields in all hosts when compared to psm752 constructed previously. in particular proteus mirabilis lvi(pmls10) proved to be the most productive host, exhibiting complete secretion  of the active protein at yields as high as 24000 unit per ml.

TI  == root canal microflora: qualitative changes after endodontic instrumentation.
AB  == the changes in the pattern of bacteria in root canal after repeated washing with  naocl and endodontic instrumentation were evaluated. samples were obtained from the root canals of patients before and after endodontic instrumentation, and analyzed according to the usual microbiological techniques. washing with naocl and endodontic instrumentation act against bacteria such as peptostreptococci, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, proteus mirabilis, bacteroides, whereas streptococcus lactis and aerococcus were present before and after endodontic instrumentation. environmental conditions such as low ph could be responsible for the persistence of gram-positive bacteria. the use of topical treatment and the associated endodontic instrumentation seem useful in the eradication of some bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
