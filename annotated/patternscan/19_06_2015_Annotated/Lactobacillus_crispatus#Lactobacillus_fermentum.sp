TI  == screening of probiotic candidates in human oral bacteria for the prevention of dental disease.
AB  == the oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. however, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. nowadays, probiotics are  expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. this study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. we screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects.  these bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. we then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and  infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. as a result, lactobacillus  crispatus yit 12319, lactobacillus fermentum yit 12320, lactobacillus gasseri yit 12321, and streptococcus mitis yit 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. these candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == inhibition of hiv and hsv infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == background and the purpose of the study: the cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. methods: the in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle hiv-1 replication and hsv-2 plaque reduction assays. the xtt proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. the in vivo anti-hsv-1 activity was evaluated in balb/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. results and major conclusion: dmem culture supernatant of l. gasseri and l. fermentum (ph 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of hiv replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. co-culture of l. gasseri  (1000 cfu/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of hiv replication. the supernatant of l. crispatus inhibited 50% of hsv replication at  4% and also co-culture of l. gasseri, l. rhamnosus and l. crispatus revokes almost all of the hsv multiplication. culture supernatants of l. gasseri and l. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the hiv and hsv and inhibited  hsv infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. alive l. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting hsv-1 infection in vivo condition. current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with  neutralizing activity against hiv and hsv and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == [selection and genotyping of lactobacillus with potential preventive effect by repetitive element sequence-based pcr analysis].
AB  == we selected and characterized isolates of lactobacillus crispatus (l. crispatus)  for potential preventing infections of the female reproductive tract. we cultured vaginal swabs from healthy volunteers on de man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar and identified the isolates at the species level by 16s rrna sequence and genotyped the isolates of lactobacillus by pcr amplification of repetitive bacterial dna elements (rep-pcr). furthermore, 10 l. crispatus strains were assessed for hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and acid production. overall 65 isolates were confirmed  to be lactobacillus by sequence analogy, among them 19 were l. crispatus, 17 were lactobacillus jensenii and 12 were lactobacillus fermentum. rep-pcr produced specie and strain-specific genomic fingerprints for the lactobacillus isolates. the selected 10 l. crispatus isolates produced highly acidic environment after growth in mrs. the isolates t22-3 and t29-5 demonstrated high production of h2o2. this study indicated that there are individual differences with vaginal lactobacillus colonization, and strain diversity within vaginal l. crispatus isolates, t22-3 and t29-5 might be candidates for restoring urogenital health environment in females.

TI  == screening for lactobacilli with probiotic properties in the infant gut microbiota.
AB  == lactobacilli are believed to be beneficial for the human hosts and are currently  being evaluated as potentially probiotic bacteria. in this study, lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. seventy-four lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. the bacterial isolates were identified mainly as l. gasseri, l. crispatus, lactobacillus paracasei, l. salivarius, l. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rrna gene. the strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. the great majority of  the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low ph conditions (ph 2 and 3). interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at ph 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at ph  2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. two of  the strains were able to adhere to caco-2 cells. in conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in  vivo evaluation.

TI  == (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  == a group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (gtg)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the ccm bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by phes gene sequencing. in total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. the (gtg)(5)-pcr method identified lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the lactobacillus crispatus (18), lactobacillus mucosae (one), and lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. l. jensenii strains were distributed over  two fingerprint clusters. the majority of samples was dominated by one (gtg)(5)-pcr type. the rep-pcr fingerprinting using the (gtg)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. this method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. in addition, lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.

TI  == correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  == identification of lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. a carbohydrate fermentation test (api 50 ch) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. the kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. using the molecular technique, l. crispatus (32.6%), l. jensenii (25%) and l. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. however, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: l. acidophilus (34.8%), l. crispatus (27.2%) and  l. fermentum (13%). although l. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by pcr. agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. although rates of l. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). conclusions: our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (multiplex pcr) for  the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting l. vaginalis and l. iners.

TI  == diversity and dynamics of lactobacilli populations during ripening of rdo camembert cheese.
AB  == the diversity and dynamics of lactobacillus populations in traditional raw milk camembert cheese were monitored throughout the manufacturing process in 3 dairies. culture-dependent analysis was carried out on isolates grown on acidified de man - rogosa - sharpe agar and lactobacillus anaerobic de man rogosa sharpe agar supplemented with vancomycin and bromocresol green media. the isolates were identified by polymerase chain reaction - temperature gradient gel  electrophoresis (pcr-tgge) and (or) species-specific pcr and (or) sequencing, and lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus plantarum isolates were characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). milk and cheese were subjected to culture-independent analysis by pcr-tgge. presumed lactobacilli were detected by  plate counts throughout the ripening process. however, molecular analysis of total dna and dna of isolates failed to detect lactobacillus spp. in certain cases. the dominant species in the 3 dairies was l. paracasei. pfge analysis revealed 21 different profiles among 39 l. paracasei isolates. lactobacillus plantarum was the second most isolated species, but it occurred nearly exclusively in one dairy. the other species isolated were lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus helveticus, a lactobacillus psittaci/delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus/gallinarum/crispatus group, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus kefiri, and lactobacillus perolens. lactobacilli diversity  at the strain level was high. dynamics varied among dairies, and each cheese exhibited a specific picture of species and strains.

TI  == species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in uganda and korea.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. the aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance  of lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, uganda and korea. methods and results: vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in uganda and korea. the lactobacillus rogosa sl agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. after phenotypic  analyses, the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the blast program and phylogenetic tree construction. a total of 338  (128 korean and 210 ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and weissella. while lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, lactobacillus fermentum was common only in korean women, and lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus vaginalis only in ugandan women. among other lactic acid bacteria, weissella was more common in ugandan, and pediococcus in korean women. all weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all pediococcus strains inhibited candida species. conclusion: although many  lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. significance and impact of the  study: the knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus, pediococcus and weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.

TI  == molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from bulgarian women.
AB  == lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. the development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of  vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation.  the aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal lactobacillus  isolates obtained from bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. a combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. all vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ardra results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. finally, the strains were  subjected to pcr analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following  species: lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus helveticus and lactobacillus plantarum. in conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ardra or ribotyping, followed by pcr specific primers identification at species level.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction techniques and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for differentiation of oral lactobacillus species.
AB  == background/aims: the genus lactobacillus has been associated with dental caries in humans, although it is seldom speciated due to lack of simple and nonlaborious identification methods. a considerable heterogeneity among lactobacillus species  has been demonstrated. the purpose of this study was to develop simple methods combining restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified 16s rrna (16s rrna gene pcr-rflp) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) for the identification of 13 reference strains of lactobacillus. methods: the 16s rrna gene sequences were  amplified by pcr using universal primers and digestion of pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. the 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp is reproducible and has been proved to be useful for differentiating lactobacillus strains to species level. seventy-seven lactobacillus isolates from a thai population were used to show the applicability of the identification test. results: pcr-rflp alone had limitations, because the rflp patterns of lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus and of lactobacillus acidophilus  and lactobacillus crispatus showed similar patterns; however, these could be differentiated by sds-page. of the 77 isolates, 38 were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, 25 as l. rhamnosus, 5 as lactobacillus salivarius, 5 as  l. casei, 3 as l. acidophilus and 1 as lactobacillus plantarum. conclusion: 16s rrna gene pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, together with sds-page protein profiles could be an alternative method for the identification of oral lactobacillus strains to species level, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the association of lactobacillus to dental caries.

TI  == [inhibitory activity of vaginal lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  == growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of lactobacillus on candida. the aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. the majority of strains belonged  to l. acidophilus: l. acidophilus sensu stricto, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l.  johnsonii as well as l. fermentum and l. plantarum species. culture supernatants  of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their  inhibitory activity against the growth of candida albicans and c. glabrata. the results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against c. albicans was demonstrated by l. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. on the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-h2o2 producing l. plantarum supernatants. growth of c. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of lactobacillus. comparison of activity of live active cultures of lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure h2o2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. this suggests that mixtures of lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.

TI  == quantitative analysis of diverse lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  == our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. the present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to  total load of lactobacilli by real-time pcr. pooled dna was amplified by pcr with lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. based on 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. specific pcr primers were designed for nine prominent species, including lactobacillus gasseri, l. ultunensis, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus, l. casei, l. crispatus, l. delbrueckii, l. fermentum, and l. gallinarum. more than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. quantification by real-time pcr revealed various proportions of  the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of l. gasseri and l. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. the findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of lactobacillus spp. in  the context of extension of the carious lesion.

TI  == isolation, selection, and characterization of lactic acid bacteria for a competitive exclusion product to reduce shedding of escherichia coli o157:h7 in cattle.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected on the basis of characteristics indicating that they would be good candidates for a competitive exclusion product (cep) that would inhibit escherichia coli o157:h7 in the intestinal tract of live cattle. fecal samples from cattle that were culture negative for e. coli o157:h7  were collected. lab were isolated from cattle feces by repeated plating on deman  rogosa sharpe agar and lactobacillus selection agar. six hundred eighty-six pure  colonies were isolated, and an agar spot test was used to test each isolate for its inhibition of a four-strain mixture of e. coli o157:h7. three hundred fifty-five isolates (52%) showed significant inhibition. seventy-five isolates showing maximum inhibition were screened for acid and bile tolerance. most isolates were tolerant of acid at ph levels of 2, 4, 5, and 7 and at bile levels  of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.3% (oxgall) and were subsequently identified with the api system. lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus delbreukii, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus cellobiosus, leuconostoc spp., and pediococcus acidilactici were the most commonly identified lab. nineteen strains were further tested for antibiotic resistance and inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 in manure and rumen fluid. four of these 19 strains showed susceptibility to all of the antibiotics, 13 significantly reduced e. coli counts in manure, and 15 significantly reduced e. coli counts in rumen fluid (p < 0.05) during at least one of the sampling periods. one of the strains, m35, was selected as the best candidate for a cep. a 16s rrna sequence analysis of m35 revealed its close homology to lactobacillus crispatus. the cep developed will be used in cattle-feeding trials.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial population dynamics in sourdough fermentation processes  by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == four sourdoughs (a to d) were produced under practical conditions by using a starter mixture of three commercially available sourdough starters and a baker's  yeast constitutively containing various species of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the sourdoughs were continuously propagated until the composition of the lab flora remained stable. two lab-specific pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) systems were established and used to monitor the development of the microflora. depending on the prevailing ecological conditions  in the different sourdough fermentations, only a few lactobacillus species were found to be competitive and became dominant. in sourdough a (traditional process  with rye flour), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and a new species, l. mindensis,  were detected. in rye flour sourdoughs b and c, which differed in the process temperature, exclusively l. crispatus and l. pontis became the predominant species in sourdough b and l. crispatus, l. panis, and l. frumenti became the predominant species in sourdough c. on the other hand, in sourdough d (corresponding to sourdough c but produced with rye bran), l. johnsonii and l. reuteri were found. the results of pcr-dgge were consistent with those obtained by culturing, except for sourdough b, in which l. fermentum was also detected. isolates of the species l. sanfranciscensis and l. fermentum were shown by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr analysis to originate from the commercial  starters and the baker's yeast, respectively.

TI  == the potential of a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach in evaluating microbial diversity of natural whey cultures for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production: bias of  culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses.
AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16s rrna gene sequences.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. methods and results: thirty-five lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16s rrna genes were determined and compared with existing data in  genbank. a phylogenetic tree was achieved using the neighbour-joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. the results showed that most vaginal isolates were l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. some were l. vaginalis, l. fermentum, l. mucosae, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. two isolates from a native american woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental lactobacillus species. conclusions: most women worldwide were colonized by three common lactobacillus species: l. crispatus, l. jensenii and l. gasseri. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of vaginal lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial  replacement therapy.

TI  == quality control lactobacillus strains for use with the api 50ch and api zym systems at 37 degrees c.
AB  == the api 50ch and api zym systems fulfil an important role in the polyphasic taxonomic identification of lactobacilli. when the api 50ch fermentation profile  of the quality control lactobacillus casei var. alactosus (lb. paracasei subsp. paracasei) strain ncfb 206 was determined at 37 degrees c, it was found to differ from that determined at 30 degrees c by biomereiux sa (montalieu vercieu, france) and the national collection of food bacteria (aberdeen, scotland). in addition, the api 50ch fermentation and api zym profiles of lb. casei strain atcc 334t determined at 37 degrees c differed from those determined at 30 degrees c by lee  and simard (1984). strains ncfb 206 and atcc 334t were thus assumed to exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile, a phenomenon recently described by nigatu et al. (2000). in contrast, lb. rhamnosus strain atcc 243t did not exhibit temperature-dependent variation in fermentation profile. moreover, the fermentation profile obtained at 37 degrees c differed in only one  respect (positive beta-gentiobiose utilisation) from that published by collins et al. (1989). in addition, lactobacillus strain gg produced a stable and reproducible api zym profile at 37 degrees c, although some variation in the level of enzyme activity was evident. thus, strain ncfb 206 was replaced by strain atcc 243t as the quality control strain of choice for use with the api 50ch fermentation system, and lactobacillus strain gg adopted for use as a quality control strain with the api zym system for strain identification of lactobacilli at 37 degrees c. the api 50ch and api zym profiles of the commercially important lactobacillus strains ncfb 1748, gg, kld, f19, and aca-dc  212.3 were determined at 37 degrees c after anaerobic growth in mrs broth. the fermentation and enzyme profiles of strain ncfb 1748 were almost identical to those of lb. crispatus atcc 33820t, those of strain gg were found to be more similar to those of lb. rhamnosus strain 243t than lb. zeae strain atcc 15820t, those of strain kld were most similar to those of lb. fermentum dsm 20052t, while those of strains f19 and aca-dc 212.3 were similar to those of lb. casei strain atcc 334t.

TI  == decarboxylation of substituted cinnamic acids by lactic acid bacteria isolated during malt whisky fermentation.
AB  == seven strains of lactobacillus isolated from malt whisky fermentations and representing lactobacillus brevis, l. crispatus, l. fermentum, l. hilgardii, l. paracasei, l. pentosus, and l. plantarum contained genes for hydroxycinnamic acid (p-coumaric acid) decarboxylase. with the exception of l. hilgardii, these bacteria decarboxylated p-coumaric acid and/or ferulic acid, with the production  of 4-vinylphenol and/or 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively, although the relative activities on the two substrates varied between strains. the addition of p-coumaric acid or ferulic acid to cultures of l. pentosus in mrs broth induced hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna within 5 min, and the gene was also induced by the indigenous components of malt wort. in a simulated distillery fermentation, a mixed culture of l. crispatus and l. pentosus in the presence of  saccharomyces cerevisiae decarboxylated added p-coumaric acid more rapidly than the yeast alone but had little activity on added ferulic acid. moreover, we were  able to demonstrate the induction of hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylase mrna under these conditions. however, in fermentations with no additional hydroxycinnamic acid, the bacteria lowered the final concentration of 4-vinylphenol in the fermented wort compared to the level seen in a pure-yeast fermentation. it seems likely that the combined activities of bacteria and yeast  decarboxylate p-coumaric acid and then reduce 4-vinylphenol to 4-ethylphenol more effectively than either microorganism alone in pure cultures. although we have shown that lactobacilli participate in the metabolism of phenolic compounds during malt whisky fermentations, the net result is a reduction in the concentrations of 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol prior to distillation.

TI  == rapid identification of 11 human intestinal lactobacillus species by multiplex pcr assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna.
AB  == rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex pcr was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex pcr assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23s rrna  gene of members of the genus lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). the established two-step multiplex pcr assays were applied  to the identification of 84 lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the pcr results were consistent with the results from the dna-dna hybridization assay. these results suggest that the multiplex pcr system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  == in the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to l. acidophilus atcc 4356. strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as lactobacillus gasseri, l. jensenii and l. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as l. fermentum. moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.
