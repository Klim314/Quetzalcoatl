TI  == nxl-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and mrsa.
AB  == novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin nxl-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired mrsa, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. nxl-103 is a combination of streptogramin a:streptogramin b components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. in multiple in vitro studies, nxl-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including mrsa), streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis,  haemophilus influenzae and haemophilus parainfluenzae. nxl-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. in phase i clinical trials, nxl-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. the first phase ii trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of nxl-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. nxl-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.

TI  == effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  == the activity of eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of s. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of s. agalactiae, 20 isolates of staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of h. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. the cytotoxicity was evaluated on  vero cells by the mtt test. the antibacterial activity was evaluated by the kirby bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. h. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and s. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by s. pneumoniae. the antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild  activity on mumps virus.

TI  == antibacterial activity of propolis and its active principles alone and in combination with macrolides, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones against microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  == propolis is produced by bees and is reported to have several pharmaceutical properties. its antibacterial activity against strains causing upper respiratory  tract infections is particularly important: propolis might be used as a therapeutic agent to prevent the bacterial infections that sometimes overlap viral infections. in this study the in vitro activity of both an alcoholic solution and a hydroglyceric extract of propolis, as well as its active principles, was tested against bacteria responsible for respiratory infections (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes). we also evaluated the in vitro activity of a combination of propolis and its active principles and some beta-lactams, macrolides and fluoroquinolones. our results, though not demonstrating a clearly synergistic activity between antibiotics and propolis and its constituents, show the possibility of using natural preparations, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties, to enhance antibacterial therapy.

TI  == comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent north american clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29  species isolated in the us and canada between 1997 and 1999. based upon minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. against enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general,  displayed weak activity with only proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of gram-negative non-enterobacteriaceae including haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against burkholderia cepacia, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.

TI  == cefditoren pivoxil.
AB  == cefditoren pivoxil is an orally absorbed prodrug that is rapidly hydrolysed by intestinal esterases to the microbiologically active cephalosporin cefditoren. cefditoren has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including common respiratory and skin pathogens. cefditoren has shown excellent in vitro activity against the gram-positive pathogens penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus. cefditoren was inactive against methicillin-resistant s. aureus. of the important gram-negative  pathogens, cefditoren had potent antibacterial effects against beta-lactamase-positive and -negative haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and beta-lactamase-positive and -negative moraxella catarrhalis. cefditoren does  not have antibacterial activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa or atypical respiratory pathogens and has only variable activity against anaerobes. in healthy volunteers, single doses of cefditoren pivoxil 200 and 400mg achieved maximal plasma concentrations of 2.6 to 3.1 mg/l and 3.8 to 4.6 mg/l, respectively. cefditoren penetrates rapidly into bronchopulmonary and tonsillar tissue as well as inflammatory and noninflammatory blister fluid. in two, randomised, double-blind trials involving patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (aecb), cefditoren 200 and 400mg twice daily for 10 days produced clinical cure rates of 88 to 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. clinical cure rates in patients with aecb were similar to those of either clarithromycin 500mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg twice daily. in patients with streptococcal pharyngitis, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200mg twice daily produced clinical cure rates of 94% at 4 to 7 days after treatment, which were similar to those observed for phenoxymethylpenicillin potassium 250 mg four times daily. in uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, a 10-day course of cefditoren pivoxil 200 or 400mg twice daily produced the same clinical cure rate of 89% within 48 hours of treatment completion. these cefditoren pivoxil dosage regimens were as effective as a 10-day course of either cefadroxil 500 mg twice daily or cefuroxime axetil 250mg  twice daily in treating uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by s. aureus and s. pyogenes. the most common adverse events associated with therapeutic doses of cefditoren pivoxil are diarrhoea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and vaginal candidiasis.

TI  == penicillin failure and copathogenicity in streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis.
AB  == recurrent group a beta-hemolytic streptococcus (gabhs) pharyngotonsillitis related to penicillin failure presents a serious clinical problem. failure to eradicate streptococci from patients can occasionally lead to rheumatic fever and rarely to glomerulonephritis. beta-lactamase-producing strains of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in inflamed tonsils have been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in the eradication of these infections. these organisms include staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae and h parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, fusobacterium sp, and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. the indirect pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent  in their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin-susceptible pathogens from that drug. these organisms have demonstrated the ability to protect gabhs in vitro and in vivo from penicillin. numerous reports have described the successful therapy of recurrent gabhs tonsillitis with antimicrobials directed at both gabhs and the beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == [microbiological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of rokitamycin dry syrup in the pediatric field].
AB  == rokitamycin (rkm), a newly developed macrolide antibiotic with a 16-membered ring, dissolves well under acidic conditions. it has been improved over other macrolides to minimize individual variations in its absorbability. we measured, using the ga-test, variations in gastric acidities of 43 children with ages between 1 to 14 years, and investigated the relationship between gastric acidities and pharmacokinetic values. also activities (expressed in mics) of antimicrobial agents were studied against clinically isolated 229 bacterial strains using an inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. tested organisms included streptococcus pyogenes (77 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (29), streptococcus pneumoniae (2), as gram-positive cocci, and haemophilus influenzae (1), haemophilus parainfluenzae (1), bordetella pertussis (12), salmonella sp. (4) and campylobacter jejuni (103) as gram-negative bacilli. against stock strains of bacteria, mics of 10 drugs (rkm, erythromycin (em), josamycin (jm), midecamycin (mdm), midecamycin acetate (mom), clindamycin (cldm), amoxicillin (ampc), cefaclor (ccl), minocycline, ofloxacin (oflx] were determined. against isolates from patients who underwent treatment with rkm, mics of only 4 drugs (rkm, em, jm, mom) were determined. measurements were made on plasma and urinary concentrations of rkm and its urinary recovery rates after patients including 6 boys with ages between 5 years 1 month and 11 years 6 months were administered with rkm (dry syrup). two groups of 6 boys were administered between meals with rkm at dose levels of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. clinical and bacteriological  effects of rkm were evaluated for 175 patients including 5 cases of pharyngitis,  3 tonsillitis, 32 pneumonia, 17 mycoplasmal pneumonia, 34 atypical pneumonia, 28  streptococcal infections, 29 campylobacter enteritis, 4 salmonella gastroenteritis, and 23 enteritis due to unknown organisms. five drop-out cases were excluded from the evaluations. in the evaluable cases, an average dose level used was 31.8 mg/kg/day, with a daily dose divided into 3 to 4 administrations and with an average treatment duration of 9 days. adverse reactions of rkm and its effects on laboratory test values were investigated in these patients including the drop out cases. obtained results of these studies are summarized below. 1. the ga-test produced ph values indicating that amounts of gastric acid  were mostly either normal or high in 42 of the 43 subjects tested (97.7%), and only one low acid case (2.3%) was observed.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (l-105, czon), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. antibacterial activities of czon against clinically isolated strains of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus parainfluenzae and h. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (cmx), latamoxef (lmox), cefoperazone (cpz), cefmetazole (cmz), cefotiam (ctm) and cefazolin (cez). czon was nearly as active as cez against s. aureus and s. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other gram-positive cocci. against gram-negative rods, czon was as active as cmx and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of czon at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. mean serum concentrations of czon at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. mean cumulative urinary excretion rates  within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2,  acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, uti 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with czon at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. the overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. no adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of got and gpt in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. these results clearly indicate the usefulness of czon in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.

TI  == clinical aspects of adult epiglottitis.
AB  == epiglottitis in adults has been considered a medical rarity. recent evidence suggests that this disorder is seen in adults regularly, though uncommonly, in clinical practice. we present 14 cases of adult epiglottitis. most cases were blood culture-negative; hemophilus influenzae was isolated from blood cultures in two cases and hemophilus parainfluenzae in one case. there were no deaths. epiglottitis in adults differs from pediatric epiglottitis in the mode of presentation, bacterial cause and clinical course.

TI  == [fundamental and clinical studies on cefminox in the field of pediatrics].
AB  == a new antibiotic of cephamycin group, cefminox (cmnx, mt-141) was studied both fundamentally and clinically in the field of pediatrics. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cmnx for clinical isolates including 24 strains of s. aureus, 15 strains of s. pyogenes, 21 strains of h. influenzae, 24 strains of e.  coli, 22 strains of k. pneumoniae and 22 strains of p. mirabilis were determined  and compared to those of cefmetazole (cmz), latamoxef (lmox), cefotaxime (ctx), cefoperazone (cpz) and cefazolin (cez). the mic80 (80% mic) values of cmnx for h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were 1.56, 1.56, 0.39 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. when compared to antibacterial activities of the control drugs, the activity of cmnx was inferior to those of ctx and lmox but superior to those of cmz and cez. on the other hand, mic80 values of cmnx for s.  pyogenes and s. aureus were 6.25 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, the activities being inferior to all of cmz, ctx, lmox, cpz and cez used as the control drugs. in 3 pediatric patients of 9 to 12 years old, 20 mg/kg of cmnx was given intravenously as one shot and serum and urinary concentrations were determined. the mean serum  concentrations in these 3 cases were 124 micrograms/ml, 102 micrograms/ml, 74.0 micrograms/ml, 47.9 micrograms/ml, 20.4 micrograms/ml, 9.2 micrograms/ml and 4.3  micrograms/ml at 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours, respectively, with a half-life of 1.83 hours. the mean urinary concentrations were 1,968 micrograms/ml at 0 approximately 2 hours, 1,205 micrograms/ml at 2 approximately 4 hours, 761 micrograms/ml at 4 approximately 6 hours and 409 micrograms/ml at 6 approximately 8 hours, with 65.4% of the drug dosed recovered from the urine within the first 8 hours on an average. cmnx was used in the treatment of 22 clinical cases including 3 cases of acute purulent tonsillitis, 3 cases of acute bronchitis, 9 cases of acute pneumonia, 5 cases of acute pyelonephritis and 2 cases of acute enteritis. clinical results in 20 cases excluded of 2 cases of mycoplasma pneumonia were rated as excellent in 19 cases and as good in 1 case, with an efficacy rate being 100% taking excellent and good cases as effective cases. bacteriological results for 5 strains of h. influenzae, 1 strain of h. parainfluenzae, 5 strains of e. coli, 2 strains of k. oxytoca and 1 strain of s.  pneumoniae revealed that disappearance was obtained for all strains but 1 strain  of p. aeruginosa which persisted.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == ceftriaxone administered once or twice a day for treatment of bacterial infections of childhood.
AB  == twenty-six children received a single daily intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg, for a variety of bacterial infections including abscess (5), cellulitis (5), periorbital cellulitis (5), bacteremia without focus (4), osteomyelitis (2), pneumonia (2), pyelonephritis (2) and otitis media (1). organisms isolated from infectious foci were staphylococcus aureus (9), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), streptococcus pyogenes (3), escherichia coli (2); and haemophilus influenzae type b, nontypable h. influenzae, group b streptococcus, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parainfluenzae and satelliting streptococcus (1 each). microbiologic  cure was achieved in 20 of 22 (91%) infections and clinical cure in 25 of 26 (96%). fifteen possible adverse reactions occurred in 34 patients evaluable for drug safety; most were mild and self-limited. neutropenia developed in two patients necessitating discontinuation of ceftriaxone in one, followed by prompt  resolution. seventeen children received ceftriaxone, 75 mg/kg/day, in two divided doses for a similar variety of infections. bacteriologic and clinical cure rates  of 100 and 94%, respectively, were demonstrated. leukopenia developed in one patient and resolved when ceftriaxone was discontinued. once a day dosing of ceftriaxone in pediatric patients provides greater ease of administration combined with efficacy equal to that achieved with a divided dosage schedule.

TI  == acute epiglottitis in adults.
AB  == we treated four adults whose upper airway was compromised due to acute epiglottitis. we also reviewed the english literature for all reports of this condition in adults (18 years and older). among the 158 cases, the infectious etiology was identified in 29 (h. influenzae 20, streptococcus pneumoniae six, h. parainfluenzae two, streptococcus pyogenes one). in the remaining cases, the etiology was uncertain. bacteremia was documented in 23/32 patients (71.9%), but  extra-epiglottic infections were strikingly rare (x = six). the clinical manifestations were sore throat (100%), fever (88%), dyspnea (78%), dysphagia (76%), anterior neck cellulitis or tenderness (27%), hoarseness (21%), pharyngitis (20%) and anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (9%). complete airway obstruction ensued in 23 out of the 119 subjects (18.3%) who had respiratory difficulty. overall mortality rate was 17.6% but it was 6.4% among the patients who were semi-electively tracheostomized or endotracheally intubated. these findings illustrate that antibiotics therapy active against h. influenzae is required in the treatment of acute epiglottitis in adults. additionally, airway patency should be established when inspiratory stridor appears assuring uncomplicated recovery.

TI  == potential significance of colonization with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus  parainfluenzae in children.
AB  == recent surveys in vancouver showed most healthy children were colonized with beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae. such organisms might alter the effects of penicillins on throat bacteria by local inactivation. to test this hypothesis in vitro, three isolates of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae were each mixed on a membrane with ampicillin-sensitive strains of haemophilus influenzae type b or group a streptococcus pyogenes and exposed to ampicillin. when tested alone, susceptible strains were rapidly killed but when tested together with a beta-lactamase producer, they were protected, indicating efficient ampicillin degradation by haemophilus parainfluenzae strains. if similar interactions occur in vivo, the effects of beta-lactams on throat bacteria could be significantly altered in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing haemophilus parainfluenzae.

TI  == [gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  == we studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing  with other antibiotics. beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci  are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. staph, aureus and staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin,  and no resistant strain to this drug was found. haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae and h. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. escherichia coli, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and five species of proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. a few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in e. coli, citrobacerr, serratia, pr. morganii and pr. rettgeri. pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of proteus. antibacterial activity of gentamicin against pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. gentamicin-resistant strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
