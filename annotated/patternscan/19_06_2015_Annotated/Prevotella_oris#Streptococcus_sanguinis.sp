TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.
