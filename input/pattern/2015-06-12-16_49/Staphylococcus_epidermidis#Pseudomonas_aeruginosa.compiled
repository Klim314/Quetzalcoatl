TI  - Antibacterial activity of ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sea urchin gonad is considered as a highly prized delicacy in several  countries. It is also rich in valuable bioactive compounds including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and beta-carotene. This study was undertaken to examine the antimicrobial properties of the ovary extract from sea urchin Diadema setosum against selected Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ovary extract was obtained using two different solvents such as methanol and chloroform. The obtained extract was used to examine its potential antimicrobial properties against the following 11 bacterial species using the disc diffusion method: Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter sp, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumonia) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus). The activity was measured in terms of zone of inhibition (mm). RESULTS: The methanol extract exhibited a higher zone of inhibition against all the bacteria taken for examination. Whereas, the ovary extract obtained by chloroform did not show any antimicrobial activity against S. typhi, S. epidermidis, C. freundii and K. pneumonia. The results indicated that the ovary extract obtained by methanol extracts are capable of inhibiting the growth of pathogenic microbes taken for analysis. Moreover, the result indicates the presence of antimicrobial agents in sea urchin ovary. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that the ovary extract of D. setosum may be a potential source of antimicrobial agent for pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  Raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6.107 to 6.104 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Anti-Biofilm Activity of Low-Amperage Continuous and Intermittent Direct Electrical Current.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are difficult to treat using available antimicrobial agents, so new anti-biofilm strategies are needed. We previously showed that 20, 200, and 2000muA of electrical current reduced bacterial biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we tested continuous direct current at lower amperages, intermittent direct current, and combinations of surface materials (Teflon or titanium) and electrode compositions (stainless steel, graphite, titanium or platinum) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, we tested 200 or 2000muA for 1 and 4 days against biofilms of 33 strains representing 13 species of microorganisms. The logarithmic reduction factor (LRF) was used to measure treatment effects. Using continuous current delivery, the lowest active amperage was 2muA for 1, 4 or 7 days against P. aeruginosa, and 5muA for 7 days against S. epidermidis and S. aureus biofilms. Delivery of 200muA for 4 hours a day over 4 days reduced P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis biofilms on Teflon or titanium discs. A reduction of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis biofilms was measured for 23 of 24 combinations of surface materials and electrode compositions tested. Four days of direct current delivery reduced biofilms of 25 of 33 strains studied. In conclusion, low-amperage current or 4 hours a day of intermittent current delivered using a variety of electrode compositions reduced P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis biofilms on a variety of surface materials. The electricidal effect was observed against a majority of bacterial species studied.
TI  - Composition and Antimicrobial Activity of Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne Essential Oil.
AB  - Eyebright, Euphrasia rostkoviana Hayne (Scrophulariaceae), is a medicinal plant traditionally used in Europe for the treatment of various health disorders, especially as eyewash to treat eye ailments such as conjunctivitis and blepharitis that can be associated with bacterial infections. Some Euphrasia species have been previously reported to contain essential oil. However, the composition and bioactivity of E. rostkoviana oil are unknown. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the eyebright essential oil against some organisms associated with eye infections: Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. GC-MS analysis revealed more than 70 constituents, with n-hexadecanoic acid (18.47%) as the main constituent followed by thymol (7.97%), myristic acid (4.71%), linalool (4.65%), and anethole (4.09%). The essential oil showed antimicrobial effect against all organisms tested with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The best activity was observed against all Gram-positive bacteria tested with the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 512 microg/mL. This is the first report on the chemical composition of E. rostkoviana essential oil and its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Activity of lipo-cyclic gamma-AApeptides against biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Antibiotic resistant bacterial infection is currently a serious public concern. Their ability to form biofilms further complicates the treatment. Herein we investigated the activity of lipo-cyclic gamma-AApeptides against both planktonic cells and biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in comparison to those of the conventional antibiotic ciprofloxacin. Our results suggest that these lipo-cyclic gamma-AApeptides exhibit comparable or enhanced performance compared to ciprofloxacin in the prevention of biofilm formation for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, providing a potential alternative treatment and prevention for indwelling device-related infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oils of Portuguese Foeniculum vulgare fruits.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation from fruits of six fennel accessions collected from wild populations occurring in the centre and south of Portugal. Composition of essential oils was established by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The obtained yields of the essential oils were found to vary greatly in the range of 1.1 to 2.9% (v/w) and the chemical composition varied with the region of collection. A total of 16 compounds were identified. The main compounds were fenchone (16.9 - 34.7%), estragole (2.5 - 66.0%) and trans-anethole (7.9 - 77.7%). The percentages of these three main compounds were used to determine the relationship between the different oil samples and to group them into four different chemotypes: anethole/fenchone; anethole; estragole and anethole/estragole. Antifungal activity of essential oils was evaluated against six food spoilage fungi: Aspergillus niger, A. japonicus, A. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizophus oryzae and R. stolonifer. Antibacterial activity was assessed against three Gram-positive strains: Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228 and S. aureus ATCC 28213; and against six Gram-negative strains: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Morganella morganii LFG 08; Proteus mirabilis LFG 04; Salmonella enteritidis LFG 05; S. entiritidis serovar typhimurium LFG 06 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 by the disc diffusion agar method; the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using the broth macro-dilution method. The MIC values varied from 62.5 (E. coli ATCC 25922) to 2000 micromL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853).
TI  - Mechanism of cell integration on biomaterial implant surfaces in the presence of  bacterial contamination.
AB  - Bacterial contamination during biomaterial implantation is often unavoidable, yielding a combat between cells and bacteria. Here we aim to determine the modulatory function of bacterial components on stem-cell, fibroblast, and osteoblast adhesion to a titanium alloy, including the role of toll-like-receptors (TLRs). Presence of heat-sacrificed Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced dose and cell-type dependent responses. Stem-cells were most sensitive to bacterial presence, demonstrating decreased adhesion number yet increased adhesion effort with a relatively large focal adhesion contact area. Blocking TLRs had no effect on stem-cell adhesion in presence of S. aureus, but blocking both TLR2 and TLR4 induced an increased adhesion effort in presence of E. coli. Neither lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, nor bacterial DNA provoked the same cell response as did whole bacteria. Herewith we suggest a new mechanism as to how biomaterials are integrated by cells despite the unavoidable presence of bacterial contamination. Stimulation of host cell integration of implant surfaces may open a new window to design new biomaterials with enhanced healing, thereby reducing the risk of biomaterial-associated infection of both "hardware-based" implants as well as of tissue-engineered constructs, known to suffer from similarly high infection risks as currently prevailing in "hardware-based" implants.

TI  - Metabolic pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in competition with respiratory bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic airway infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa considerably contributes to lung tissue destruction and impairment of pulmonary function in cystic-fibrosis (CF) patients. Complex interplays between P. aeruginosa and other co-colonizing pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia sp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae may be crucial for pathogenesis and disease progression. METHODS: We generated a library of PA14 transposon insertion mutants to identify P. aeruginosa genes required for exploitative and direct competitions with S. aureus, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and K. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Whereas wild-type PA14 inhibited S. aureus growth, two transposon insertions located in pqsC and carB, resulted in reduced growth inhibition. PqsC is involved in the synthesis of 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs), a family of molecules having antibacterial properties, while carB is a key gene in pyrimidine biosynthesis. The carB mutant was also unable to grow in the presence of B. cepacia and K. pneumoniae but not Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. We further identified a transposon insertion in purF, encoding a key enzyme of purine metabolism. This mutant displayed a severe growth deficiency in the presence of Gram-negative but not of Gram-positive bacteria. We identified a beneficial interaction in a bioA transposon mutant, unable to grow on rich medium. This growth defect could be restored either by addition of biotin or by co-culturing the mutant in the presence of K. pneumoniae or E. coli. CONCLUSION: Complex interactions take place between the various bacterial species colonizing CF-lungs. This work identified both detrimental and beneficial interactions occurring between P. aeruginosa and three other respiratory pathogens involving several major metabolic pathways. Manipulating these pathways could be used to interfere with bacterial interactions and influence the colonization by respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological investigations of oxygen plasma treated parylene C surfaces for metal implant coating.
AB  - Parylene C surface was modified by the use of oxygen plasma treatment and characterized by microscopic and surface-sensitive techniques (E-SEM, AFM, XPS, LDI-TOF-MS, contact angle). The influence of the treatment on surface properties was investigated by calculations of surface free energy (Owens-Wendt method). Moreover, early adhesion (Culture Plate Method, Optical Microscopy Test) and biofilm formation ability (Cristal Violet Assay) on the parylene C surface was investigated. The bacteria strains which are common causative agents of medical device-associated infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - reference strains and clinical isolates) were used. It was concluded that chemical (oxygen insertion) and physical (nanotopography generation) changes, have a significant impact on the biocompatibility in terms of increased hydrophilicity (thetaw of unmodified sample=88 degrees +/-2 degrees , thetaw of 60min modified sample=17.6 degrees +/-0.8 degrees ) and surface free energy (SFE of unmodified sample=42.4mJ/m(2), and for 60min modified sample=70.1mJ/m(2)). At the same time, no statistical effect on biofilm production and bacteria attachment to the modified surface of any of the tested strains was observed.
TI  - Development of Gendine Coated Cannula for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion for Extended Use.
AB  - Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) using pumps is a widely used method for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus. One of the major factors that usually lead to the discontinuation of CSII is CSII set related issues including infection at the infusion site. Current American Diabetic Association recommends rotating sites every 2-3 days. This adds cost and creates inconvenience. Therefore, in order to prevent infections and extend durations between insertion site changes, we have developed a Teflon cannula coated with the combination of gentian violet and chlorhexidine (Gendine) and tested its antimicrobial efficacy against different pathogens. Cannulas were coated with Gendine on exterior surface and dried. Efficacy and durability of Gendine cannulas was determined against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin- susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata using biofilm colonization method. Cytotoxicity of gendine was assessed against mouse fibroblast cell lines. Gendine cannulas showed complete prevention of biofilm colonization of all organisms tested up to 2 weeks (P < 0.0001) compared to uncoated control. Gendine catheter against mouse fibroblast cells shown to be non-cytotoxic. Our in vitro results show that a novel gendine cannula is highly effective in completely inhibiting biofilm of multi-drug resistant pathogens for up to 2 weeks and may have potential clinical applications such as prolonged use, cost reduction and decreased infection rate.
TI  - Inhibition of various gram-positive and gram- negative bacteria growth on selenium nanoparticle coated paper towels.
AB  - There are wide spread bacterial contamination issues on various paper products, such as paper towels hanging in sink splash zones or those used to clean surfaces, filter papers used in water and air purifying systems, and wrappings used in the food industry; such contamination may lead to the potential spread of bacteria and consequent severe health concerns. In this study, selenium nanoparticles were coated on normal paper towel surfaces through a quick precipitation method, introducing antibacterial properties to the paper towels in a healthy way. Their effectiveness at preventing biofilm formation was tested in bacterial assays involving Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The results showed significant and continuous bacteria inhibition with about a 90% reduction from 24 to 72 hours for gram-positive bacteria including S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The selenium coated paper towels also showed significant inhibition of gram-negative bacteria like P. aeruginosa and E. coli growth at about 57% and 84%, respectively, after 72 hours of treatment. Therefore, this study established a promising selenium-based antibacterial strategy to prevent bacterial growth on paper products, which may lead to the avoidance of bacteria spreading and consequent severe health concerns.
TI  - The microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of France.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast implant infections are usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. METHODS: Thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from January 2008 to June 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. RESULTS: The prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). Of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. S. aureus was identified in 18 cases, Gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species. In addition to Propionibacterium acnes and Actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Corynebacterium simulans, Dermabacter hominis, Finegoldia magna, and Peptoniphilus harei. Seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. All cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of MALDI-TOF MS and molecular identification for diagnosis.
TI  - Cytotoxic potency of self-assembled Ruthenium(II)-NHC complexes with pincer type  2, 6-bis(N-methylimidazolylidene/benzimidazolylidene)pyrazine ligands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the cytotoxic potency of self-assembled Ruthenium(II)-NHC complexes with 2,6-di-(N-methylimidazolylidene/benzimidazolylidene)pyrazine ligands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ru(II)-N-heterocyclic (Ru-NHC) complexes, Bis-[2,6-di-(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene)pyrazine]ruthenium(II) hexaflurophosphate (3), Bis-[2,6-di-(N-methylbenzimidazol-2-ylidene)pyrazine]ruthenium(II) hexaflurophosphate (4) have been synthesized from corresponding ligands 2,6-di-(N-methylimidazolium)pyrazine dichloride (1); 2,6-di-(N-methylbenzimidazolium)pyrazine dichloride (2). Complexes were studied to determine their pro-apoptotic activity against HCT15 and Hep2 cell lines, and antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Both, complex 3 and 4, formed a nanosphere structure in aqueous growth medium. Cytotoxicity study revealed that complex 3 was more effective than complex 4. Complexes mainly target cellular DNA and bacterial cell wall. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the formation of nanoball structure of Ru(II)-NHC complexes. Thus, complex 3 provides a new insight to develop antitumor or antimicrobial drug.
TI  - Antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from Artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  - CONTEXT: Preparations from Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from A. heterophyllus heartwoods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dried and powdered A. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. Each of the extracts was screened for their antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). Their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. The extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against Streptococcus mutans, S. pyogenes, and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/mL, respectively. Based on an antibacterial assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. Among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including S. mutans, S. pyogenes, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis with MICs of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, and MBCs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microM, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against Escherichia coli, a Gram-negative bacteria with MIC and MBC values of 12.9 and 25.8 microM, respectively. Only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an MIC of 286.4 microM.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of metronidazole drug and selected counter-ions.
AB  - A series of water-soluble silver(i) complexes of the type [Ag(MTZ)2X] [MTZ = 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazole (metronidazole drug); X = NO3(-), ClO4(-), CF3COO(-), BF4(-) and CH3SO3(-)] was synthesised by the reactions of various Ag(i) salts with metronidazole (MTZ). All the complexes were characterized by ESI-MS spectrometry, solution NMR ((1)H and (13)C) and IR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. Further evidence for the formation and molecular structure of all the complexes was provided by X-ray single-crystal crystallography. The different counter ions affect the crystal packing of the complexes and thus have an impact on the final geometries. The antimicrobial activities of the complexes against two Gram-positive strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, three Gram-negative strains: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Proteus hauseri ATCC 13315 and yeast Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were evaluated and compared with antibacterial and antifungal properties of appropriate silver salts, metronidazole and silver sulfadiazine drugs. The newly synthesized compounds exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, better than the referenced silver sulfadiazine. The best active silver(i)-metronidazole complex contains a methanesulphonate counter-ion. Moreover, the complex inhibited the growth of yeast Candida albicans at a concentration 3-fold lower than that required for silver sulfadiazine. In addition, the complexes containing a tetrafluoroborate and a perchlorate as counter-ions were characterized as effective antibacterial agents against the tested Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Hydroxypropylcellulose as a novel green reservoir for the synthesis, stabilization, and storage of silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Polysaccharides are attracting the vigil eye of researchers in order to design the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) of diverse size, shape, and application. We report an environmentally friendly method to synthesize Ag NPs where no physical reaction conditions were employed. Hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) was used as a template nanoreactor, stabilizer, and capping agent to obtain Ag NPs. Different concentrations of AgNO3 solutions (50 mmol, 75 mmol, and 100 mmol) were mixed with a concentrated aqueous solution of HPC and the progress of the reaction was monitored by noting color changes of the reaction mixture at different reaction times for up to 24 hours. Characteristic ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV/Vis) absorption bands of Ag NPs were observed in the range of 388-452 nm. The morphology of the Ag NPs was studied by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy. The TEM images confirmed that the size of the Ag NPs was in the range of 25-55 nm. Powder X-ray diffraction studies showed that the crystal phase of the Ag NPs was face-centered cubic. The as-prepared Ag NPs were found to be stable, and no changes in size and morphology were observed after storage in HPC thin films over 1 year, as indicated by UV/Vis spectra. So, the present work furnishes a green and economical strategy for the synthesis and storage of stable Ag NPs. As-synthesized Ag NPs showed significant antimicrobial activity against different bacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungal strains (Actinomycetes and Aspergillus niger).
TI  - Evaluation of contact lens multipurpose solutions on bacterial biofilm development.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: No sooner are contact lenses (CLs) inserted into the eyes than lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins rapidly accumulate on their surface, thus favoring the adhesion of commensal bacteria and biofilm formation. Infections may be caused by the proliferation of indigenous flora or other opportunistic pathogens. Our purpose was to evaluate the activity and the capacity of different CL solutions to interfere with the mechanisms of biofilm formation and stability and use of a system to study dynamically biofilm development. METHODS: We evaluated the antibiofilm activity of three different multipurpose solutions (MPSs): Regard, Biotrue, and OPTI-FREE PureMoist on four bacterial species (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus). Static biofilm assay was first performed to analyze the effect of MPSs. Dynamic assays were performed with the BioFlux system to analyze the effect of the OxyChlorite solution Regard on the biofilm formation. RESULTS: Our studies show that MPSs are able to completely inhibit biofilm formation of Staphylococcus species and of S. marcescens after only 4 hr of incubation. Moreover, a reduction of biofilm formation by Pseudomonas was noted. Best results on P. aeruginosa were obtained with Regard. Regard was also used for dynamic assay, revealing its ability to disaggregate the mature biofilm. Regard completely inhibited biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and slowed down biofilm development by P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the CL solutions tested were all able to reduce biofilm formation. Furthermore, the BioFlux system was proven to be useful for the evaluation of the effectiveness of CL solutions against microbial biofilm formation.
TI  - [Apoptogenic activity of microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus infection].
AB  - AIM: Study apoptogenic activity of-microbes-associants during Epstein-Barr virus  infection (EBVI) on the model of mice peritoneal macrophages in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Evaluation of apoptosis induced by bacteria isolated from EBVI patients was carried out by characteristic morphological changes of macrophages in smears stained by May-Grunwald with additional staining by Romanowsky-Giemsa. RESULTS: All the EBVI microbes-associants were established to have apoptogenic activity, however, the highest pathogenic potential was noted in Streptococcus pyogenes. CONCLUSION: The presence of apoptogenic activity in bacterial microflora accompanying EBVI against immune system cells could serve as means of their survival and be the pathogenetic basis for prolonged persistence in the organism.
TI  - Trends in Microbiological and Antibiotic Sensitivity Patterns in Infectious Keratitis: 10-Year Experience in Mexico City.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the distribution and trends in microbiological and antibiotic  sensitivity patterns of infectious keratitis in a 10-year period at a reference center in Mexico City. METHODS: In this retrospective observational case series, samples were obtained from corneas with a diagnosis of infectious keratitis from January 2002 to December 2011 at the Institute of Ophthalmology "Conde de Valenciana" in Mexico City. Results of cultures, stains, and specific sensitivity/resistance antibiograms for each microorganism were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1638 consecutive corneal scrapings were analyzed. Pathogen was recovered in 616 samples (38%), with bacterial keratitis accounting for 544 of the positive cultures (88%). A nonsignificant increasing trend in gram-negative isolates (P = 0.11) was observed. The most commonly isolated pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the most common gram-negative isolated species was Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was present in 45% of the S. aureus isolates; meanwhile, 53.7% coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates were methicillin resistant (MRCNS). Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance to ceftazidime increased from 15% in the first period to 74% for the last 5 years of the study (P = 0.01). The overall sensitivity for vancomycin of MRSA was 87.5%, whereas 99.6% of the MRCNS were sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: There was a nonsignificant increase in the recovered gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms over time. We observed an increased resistance to methicillin in almost half of the MRSA and MRCNS isolates.
TI  - Novel in situ liquefying antimicrobial wrap for preventing tissue expander infections following breast reconstructive surgeries.
AB  - Breast reconstruction surgeries using tissue expanders (TEs) have highly reported infection rates. To decrease this, we developed a method for disinfecting TEs and surgical pockets, where an antimicrobial solution was applied as a solid film at implantation that subsequently liquefied in situ to provide extended prophylaxis. Silicone discs cut from TEs were covered with gelatin-based films containing minocycline (M) and rifampin (R). Discs and films soaked in saline were subsequently challenged with pathogen at days 1, 3, 7, and 10 and quantified for potential biofilm formation. Discs that were not harvested at each specific time points were refreshed with sterile saline. The discs were challenged with clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA). Recoveries of adherent organisms from uncovered silicone discs and gelatin-wrapped discs without added antimicrobial agents were >5 x 104 CFU/disc for each organism at each time point. Experimental 0.1%M/0.05%R gelatin films completely inhibited all challenge organisms from attaching to the silicone (p < 0.05) at each time point through day 10. Cytotoxicity was assessed by incubating films with HEK-293T human fibroblasts. There were no significant differences in HEK-293T cell survival between controls and any of the antimicrobial films. The in situ liquefying, bioabsorable, antimicrobial wrap prevented biofilm formation by microorganisms on silicone surfaces in vitro with minimal cytotoxicity. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as  FtsZ inhibitors.
AB  - A series of novel 4-bromo-1H-indazole derivatives as filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various phenotypes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and their cell division inhibitory activity. The results indicated that this series showed better antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes than the other tested strains. Among them, compounds 12 and 18 exhibited 256-fold and 256-fold more potent activity than 3-methoxybenzamide (3-MBA) against penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and compound 18 showed 64-fold better activity than 3-MBA but 4-fold weaker activity than ciprofloxacin in the inhibition of S. aureus ATCC29213. Particularly, compound 9 presented the best activity (4 microg/mL) against S. pyogenes PS, being 32-fold, 32-fold, and 2-fold more active than 3-MBA, curcumin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively, but it was four times less active than oxacillin sodium. In addition, some synthesized compounds displayed moderate inhibition of cell division against S. aureus ATCC25923, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853, sharing a minimum cell division concentration of 128 microg/mL.
TI  - Validation of sterility testing of cord blood: Challenges and results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterility testing for cord blood (CB) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. Here, the automated BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in CB units processed at the Canadian National Public Cord Blood Bank. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-phase validation was developed. CB units were prepared with pentastarch (Phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (Phase 3). In Phase 1, CB was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/mL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides fragilis, and Candida albicans. Plasma (8 mL) and buffy coat (BC; 0.5 and 8 mL) were inoculated into culture bottles. In Phases 2 and 3, a mix of red blood cells (RBCs) and plasma (4 mL each) was used as the inoculant. In Phase 3, Aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product RBCs and plasma were determined. The BC fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. RESULTS: In Phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in CB units containing antibiotics. Thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. C. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of RBCs and plasma, all organisms were detected. The use of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. C. albicans and A. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in RBCs and BC. Cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during CB processing. CONCLUSIONS: A mix of plasma and RBCs is appropriate for CB sterility testing. Interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. The clinical significance of the bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in CB merits further investigation.
TI  - The perennial problem of variability in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tests for hygiene monitoring within healthcare settings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE To investigate the reliability of commercial ATP bioluminometers and to document precision and variability measurements using known and quantitated standard materials. METHODS Four commercially branded ATP bioluminometers and their consumables were subjected to a series of controlled studies with quantitated materials in multiple repetitions of dilution series. The individual dilutions were applied directly to ATP swabs. To assess precision and reproducibility, each dilution step was tested in triplicate or quadruplicate and the RLU reading from each test point was recorded. Results across the multiple dilution series were normalized using the coefficient of variation. RESULTS The results for pure ATP and bacterial ATP from suspensions of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are presented graphically. The data indicate that precision and reproducibility are poor across all brands tested. Standard deviation was as high as 50% of the mean for all brands, and in the field users are not provided any indication of this level of imprecision. CONCLUSIONS The variability of commercial ATP bioluminometers and their consumables is unacceptably high with the current technical configuration. The advantage of speed of response is undermined by instrument imprecision expressed in the numerical scale of relative light units (RLU). Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2015;00(0):1-6.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  - Abstract Objective. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. Materials and methods. The growth of selected bacteria (Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus gordonii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. The content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with HPLC-ESI-MS. Results. The spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. Sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. Total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with pH varying between 4.1-5.4. Conclusions. The present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice pH explains bacterial in vitro growth. This may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.
TI  - Compounds from Geijera parviflora with prostaglandin E2 inhibitory activity may explain its traditional use for pain relief.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Australian Aboriginal people used crushed leaves  of Geijera parviflora Lindl. both internally and externally for pain relief, including for toothache (Cribb and Cribb, 1981). This study tested the hypothesis that this traditional use might be at least in part explained by the presence of compounds with anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A crude extract (95% EtOH) was prepared from powdered dried leaves. From the CH3Cl fraction of this extract compounds were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation and tested for: (1) cytotoxicity in RAW 264.7 murine leukemic monocyte-macrophages, (2) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) inhibitory activity in 3T3 Swiss albino mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, as well as (3) nitric oxide (NO) and (4) tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitory activity in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Isolated compounds were also tested for (5) antibacterial activity against a panel of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984, biofilm-forming) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) strains by broth microdilution. RESULTS: Eleven compounds were isolated, including one new flavone and one new natural product, with a further four compounds reported from this species for the first time. Some of the compounds showed good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. In particular, flindersine (1) and N-(acetoxymethyl) flindersine (3) inhibited PGE2 release with IC50 values of 5.0muM and 4.9muM, respectively, without any significant cytotoxicity. Several other compounds showed moderate inhibition of NO (5, 6, 7) and TNF-alpha (6), with IC50 in the low micromolar range; however much of this apparent activity could be accounted for by the cytotoxicity of these compounds. None of the compounds showed anti-bacterial activity. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of PGE2, an important mediator of inflammation and pain, by flindersine and a derivative thereof, along with the moderate anti-inflammatory activity shown by several other compounds isolated from Geijera parviflora leaf extract, support the traditional use of this plant for pain relief by Australian Aboriginal people.
TI  - Fluids for continuous renal replacement therapy--an evaluation of microbial integrity.
AB  - PURPOSE: We have previously demonstrated widespread microbial contamination in the dialysis and replacement fluid circuits of bicarbonate-buffered, continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs). It is not known whether different CRRT fluids have an impact on bacterial activity. METHODS: In this study the in vitro growth and biofilm formation associated with seven strains of bacteria (Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in five CRRT fluids (Prismocitrate, Monosol S, Accusol 35, tri-sodium citrate and Ci-Ca K2) were studied. The fluids were each inoculated with light and heavy concentrations of each of the bacterial strains and incubated at 22 or 37 degrees C for up to 72 h with and without bacterial growth medium. Bacterial growth was assessed by spectrophotometry. Biofilm formation was assessed by a standard microtiter plate assay. RESULTS: Unsupplemented fluids did not support bacterial growth or biofilm formation after 72 h incubation. When supplemented with bacterial growth medium, some fluids, in particular Accusol 35, Ci-Ca K2, and tri-sodium citrate, had an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth, although none suppressed growths across the panel of tested organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Different CRRT fluids have different impacts on bacterial growth and biofilm formation, but all remain susceptible to extrinsic contamination.
TI  - Sunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nanotechnology is now regarded as a distinct field of research in modern science and technology with multifaceted areas including biomedical applications. Among the various approaches currently available for the generation of metallic nanoparticles, biogenic synthesis is of increasing demand for the purpose of green nanotechnology. Among various natural sources, plant materials are the most readily available template-directing matrix offering cost-effectiveness, eco-friendliness, and easy handling. Moreover, the inherent pharmacological potentials of these medicinal plant extracts offer added biomedical implementations of the synthesized metal nanoparticles. RESULTS: A robust practical method for eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum (Tulsi) as both reducing and capping agent, under the influence of direct sunlight has been developed without applying any other chemical additives. The nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-visible spectrophotometer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The prepared silver nanoparticles exhibited considerable antibacterial activity. The effects were more pronounced on non-endospore-forming Gram-positive bacteria viz., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes than endospore-forming species Bacillus subtilis. The nanoparticles also showed prominent activity on Gram-negative human pathogenic Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and plant pathogenic Pantoea ananatis. A bactericidal mode of action was observed for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the nanoparticles. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a very simple, efficient, and practical method for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of O. sanctum under the influence of direct sunlight. The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles making use of such a traditionally important medicinal plant without applying any other chemical additives, thus offers a cost-effective and environmentally benign route for their large-scale commercial production. The nanoparticles dispersed in the mother solution showed promising antibacterial efficacy. Graphical AbstractSunlight-induced rapid and efficient biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum Linn. with enhanced antibacterial activity.
TI  - Enhanced Cellular Cytotoxicity and Antibacterial Activity of 18-beta-Glycyrrhetinic Acid by Albumin-conjugated PLGA Nanoparticles.
AB  - The aim of the present work was to encapsulate 18-beta-Glycyrrhetinic acid (GLA)  in albumin conjugated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles by a modified nanoprecipitation method. Nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by different drug to polymer ratios, human serum albumin (HSA) content, dithiothreitol (as producer of free thiol groups) content, and acetone (as non-solvent in nanoprecipitation). NPs with a size ranging from 126 to 174 nm were achieved. The highest entrapment efficiency (89.4+/-4.2%) was achieved when the ratio of drug to polymer was 1:4. The zeta potential of NPs was fairly negative (-8 to -12). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry proved the conjugation of HSA to PLGA NPs. In vitro release profile of NPs showed 2 phases: an initial burst for 4 h (34-49%) followed by a slow release pattern up to the end. The antibacterial effects of NPs against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied by microdilution method. The GLA-loaded NPs showed more antibacterial effect than pure GLA (2-4 times). The anticancer MTT test revealed that GLA-loaded NPs were approximately 9 times more effective than pure GLA in Hep G2 cells.
TI  - Detection of Bacteria Bearing Resistant Biofilm Forms, by Using the Universal and Specific PCR is Still Unhelpful in the Diagnosis of Periprosthetic Joint Infections.
AB  - Intraoperative conventional bacteriological cultures were compared with different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods in patients with total joint arthroplasties. The isolated bacteria were investigated for biofilm formation, and the biofilm forming strains, in their planktonic and biofilm forms, were further tested for their antimicrobial resistance against several clinically important antimicrobials. Forty four bone and joint samples were included and classified as infected or non-infected according to standard criteria for periprosthetic hip and knee infections. For the bacteriological diagnosis, conventional culture, two types of universal PCR and species specific PCR for three selected pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were applied. Biofilm formation determination was performed by the tissue culture plate method. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the planktonic bacteria was performed by the minimal inhibitory concentration determination and, of the biofilm forms, by the minimal inhibitory concentration for bacterial regrowth from the biofilm. Twenty samples were culture positive, with S. epidermidis, S. aureus, or P. aeruginosa. All PCR methods were very ineffective in detecting only one pathogen. All isolates were biofilm positive and their biofilm forms, were highly resistant. In this study, compared to PCR, culture remains the "gold standard." The biofilm formation by the causative bacteria and the concomitant manifold increased antimicrobial resistance may explain the clinical failure of treatment in some cases and should be considered in the future for therapeutic planning.
TI  - Synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide amphiphiles for treatment of fungal keratitis.
AB  - Fungal keratitis is a leading cause of ocular morbidity. It is frequently misdiagnosed as bacterial keratitis, causing a delay in proper treatment. Furthermore, due to the lack of safe and effective anti-fungal agents for clinical use, treatment of fugal keratitis remains a challenge. In recent years, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received considerable attention as potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents with the potential to overcome antibiotics resistance. We previously reported the design of short synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides (IKIK)2-NH2 and (IRIK)2-NH2 with excellent antimicrobial activities and selectivities against various clinically relevant microorganisms, including Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeast Candida albicans (C. albicans). In this study, we evaluated the application of the two most promising synthetic beta-sheet forming peptide candidates for in vivo fungal keratitis treatment in comparison with the commercially available amphotericin B. It was found that topical solutions of the designed peptides are safe, and as effective as the clinically used amphotericin B. Compared to the costly and unstable amphotericin B, (IKIK)2-NH2 and (IRIK)2-NH2 are water-soluble, less expensive and stable. Thus, the synthetic beta-sheet forming peptides are presented as promising candidates for the treatment of fungal keratitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activities of Three Medicinal Plants and Investigation of Flavonoids of Tripleurospermum disciforme.
AB  - Rosa damascena, Tripleurospermum disciforme and Securigera securidaca were used as disinfectant agents and for treatment of some disease in folk medicine of Iran. The antimicrobial effects of different fractions of seeds extract of S. securidaca, petals extract of R. damascena and aerial parts extract of T. disciforme were examined against some gram positive, gram negative and fungi by cup plate diffusion method. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of S. securidaca showed antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while its methanol fraction had no antibacterial effects. R. damascena petals extract demonstrated antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. T. disciforme aerial parts extract exhibited antimicrobial effects only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. None of the fractions had any antifungal activities. Therefore, present study confirmed utility of these plants as disinfectant agents. Six flavonoids were isolated from T. disciforme: Luteolin, Quercetin-7-O-glucoside, Kaempferol, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Apigenin and Apigenin-7-O-glucoside. The flavonoids and the antimicrobial activity of T. disciforme are reported for the first time.
TI  - Short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of Citrus sinensis.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of Citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcesnces, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter amnigenus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia odorifera. Methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. In vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. It was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of C. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of S. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). The potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. The order of antioxidant activity through ABTS.+ and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. Phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. It was also found that Chloroform/Methanol (5:5) and Butanol/Ethanol/Water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. These findings reveal the potential use of C. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis and Antibacterial Activity of Alkylated Diamines and Amphiphilic Amides of Quinic Acid Derivatives.
AB  - Different series of N-alkylated diamines and their derivatives condensed to quinic acid were synthesized and tested for antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lipophilic chain and carbohydrate moiety modulate the antibacterial activity and the compounds showed a structure-activity relationship. Overall, 11 compounds displayed better activity than chloramphenicol against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Monoalkylated amines 2a-h displayed an activity similar to that of ethambutol against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
TI  - Bacillus polymachus sp. nov., with a broad range of antibacterial activity, isolated from forest topsoil samples by using a modified culture method.
AB  - A new, modified culture method that utilizes a transwell plate with a 0.4 microm  pore-size microporous membrane was developed. This system allows only trace nutrients from the soil into the liquid culture through the microporous membrane. The method is a more powerful tool for the discovery of novel species from soils than are traditional methods. Such newly identified species could potentially produce useful metabolites. A bacterial strain, T515(T), was isolated using this modified culture method. Growth of strain T515(T) occurred at pH 4-9 in a temperature range between 20 degrees C and 40 degrees C and in the presence of 0-2 % (w/v) NaCl on R2A agar. Colonies on the agar plates were tiny, white, and convex after 5 days incubation at 28 degrees C. Comparative analysis of the nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain T515(T) revealed close pairwise similarity with species of the genus Bacillus, and strain T515(T) was most closely related to Bacillus panaciterrae Gsoil 1517(T) (96.7 %) and Bacillus funiculus NAF001(T) (96.0 %). The major quinone of strain T515(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (45.5 %), anteiso-C15 : 0 (23.2 %) and C16 : 0 (10.9 %). The predominant polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Strain T515(T) was sensitive to streptomycin and tetracycline, but resistant to rifampicin (0.125 microg ml(-1)), ampicillin (0.5 microg ml(-1)) and chloramphenicol (1 microg ml(-1)). The strain showed antimicrobial activities against the six strains tested: Bacillus subtilis KEMB 51201-001, Staphylococcus aureus KEMB 4659, Pseudomonas aeruginosa KACC 10185, Staphylococcus epidermidis KACC 13234, Paenibacillus larvae KACC 14031 and Escherichia coli KEMB 212-234. Based on these results, strain T515(T) represents a novel species of the genus Bacillus with the proposed name, Bacillus polymachus sp. nov. The type strain is T515(T) ( = KEMB 9005-168(T) = KACC 18242(T) = NBRC 110614(T)).
TI  - Importance of Tryptophan in Transforming an Amphipathic Peptide into a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Targeted Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Here, we found that simple substitution of amino acids in the middle position of  the hydrophobic face of an amphipathic peptide RI16 with tryptophan (T9W) considerably transformed into an antimicrobial peptide specifically targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) results demonstrated that T9W had a strong and specifically antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa, including antibiotic-resistant strains, but was not active against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphyfococcus epidermidis. Fluorescent spectroscopic assays indicated that T9W interacted with the membrane of P. aeruginosa, depolarizing the outer and the inner membrane of bacterial cells. Salt susceptibility assay showed that T9W still maintained its strong anti-pseudomonas activity in the presence of salts at physiological concentrations, and in hemolytic and MTT assays T9W also showed no toxicity against human blood cells and macrophages. In vivo assay demonstrated that T9W also displayed no toxicity to Chinese Kun Ming (KM) mice. Furthermore, the strong antibiofilm activity was also observed with the peptide T9W, which decreased the percentage of biomass formation in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these findings indicated that design of single-pathogen antimicrobial agents can be achieved by simple amino acid mutation in naturally occurring peptide sequences and this study suggested a model of optimization/design of anti-pseudomonas drugs in which the tryptophan residue was a conserved element.
TI  - Physicochemical and biological properties of oxovanadium(IV), cobalt(II) and nickel(II) complexes with oxydiacetate anions.
AB  - The potentiometric and conductometric titration methods have been used to characterize the stability of series of VO(IV)-, Co(II)- and Ni(II)-oxydiacetato complexes in DMSO-water solutions containing 0-50 % (v/v) DMSO. The influence of DMSO as a co-solvent on the stability of the complexes as well as the oxydiacetic acid was evaluated. Furthermore, the reactivity of the complexes towards superoxide free radicals was assessed by employing the nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) assay. The biological properties of the complexes were investigated in relation to their cytoprotective activity against the oxidative damage generated exogenously by using hydrogen peroxide in the Human Dermal Fibroblasts adult (HDFa) cell line as well as to their antimicrobial activity against the bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis). The relationship between physicochemical and biological properties of the complexes was discussed.
TI  - Enhanced stability and antibacterial efficacy of a traditional Chinese medicine-mediated silver nanoparticle delivery system.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are widely used as antibacterial products in various fields. Recent studies have suggested that AgNPs need an appropriate stabilizer to improve their stability. Some antibacterial traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) contain various reductive components, which can not only stabilize AgNPs but also enhance their antimicrobial activity. In this study, we developed a series of novel AgNPs using a TCM extract as a stabilizer, reducing agent, and antimicrobial agent (TCM-AgNPs). A storage stability investigation of the TCM-AgNPs suggested a significant improvement when compared with bare AgNPs. Further, conjugation of TCMs onto the AgNP surface resulted in stronger antimicrobial potency on antibacterial evaluation using Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration 50% (MIC50) ratios (and minimum bactericidal concentration 90% [MBC90] ratios) of AgNPs to respective TCM-AgNPs as assessment indices. Among these, P. cuspidatum Sieb. et-conjugated AgNPs (P.C.-AgNPs) had the advantage of a combination of TCMs and AgNPs and was studied in detail with regard to its synthesis and characterization. The extraction time, reaction temperature, and concentrations of AgNO3 and Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et extract were critical factors in the preparation of P.C.-AgNPs. Further, the results of X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated successful preparation of P.C.-AgNPs. In representative studies, P.C.-AgNPs showed a well-defined spherical shape, a homogeneous small particle size (36.78 nm), a narrow polydispersity index (0.105), and a highly negative zeta potential (-23.6 mV) on transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. These results indicate that TCM-AgNPs have a potential role as antibacterial agents in the clinic setting.
TI  - Anti-infective effects of Brazilian Caatinga plants against pathogenic bacterial  biofilm formation.
AB  - CONTEXT: The local communities living in the Brazilian Caatinga biome have a significant body of traditional knowledge on a considerable number of medicinal plants used to heal several maladies. OBJECTIVE: Based on ethnopharmacological data, this study screened 23 aqueous plant extracts against two well-known models of biofilm-forming bacteria: Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Crystal violet assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to evaluate the effect of extracts on biofilm formation and measurements of the absorbance at 600 nm to assess bacterial growth. Selected extracts were investigated regarding the cytotoxicity by MTT assay using mammal cells and the qualitative phytochemical fingerprint by thin layer chromatography. RESULTS: Harpochilus neesianus Mart. ex Nees. (Acanthaceae) leaves, Apuleia leiocarpa Vogel J. F. Macbr. (Fabaceae), and Poincianella microphylla Mart. ex G. Don L. P. Queiroz (Fabaceae) fruits showed non-biocidal antibiofilm action against S. epidermidis with activities of 69, 52, and 63%, respectively. SEM confirmed that biofilm structure was strongly prevented and that extracts promoted overproduction of the matrix and/or bacterial morphology modification. Poincianella microphylla demonstrated toxicity at 4.0 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mL, A. leiocarpa presented toxicity only at 4.0 mg/mL, whereas H. neesianus presented the absence of toxicity against Vero cell line. Preliminary phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids, steroids, amines, and polyphenols. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This work provides a scientific basis which may justify the ethnopharmacological use of the plants herein studied, indicating extracts that possess limited mammal cytotoxicity in vitro and a high potential as a source of antibiofilm drugs prototypes.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of the essential oils from flower, leaf and stem of Ferula cupularis growing wild in Iran.
AB  - CONTEXT: Ferula cupularis (Boiss.) Spalik et S. R. Downie (Apiaceae) is a common  plant in Iran that grows in the foothills of Dena Mountain. In traditional folk medicine, this plant has different applications, but there are no studies proving their uses. OBJECTIVE: This study is the first attempt to investigate the chemical composition and antibacterial effect of the essential oils of F. cupularis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oils from flower, leaf, and stem of F. cupularis were analyzed by using GC and GC-MS. Antibacterial activity of essential oils was determined by microdilution method against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The essential oil from flower of F. cupularis contained 15 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, and 2 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The leaf essential oil contained 12 monoterpene, 13 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, and 3 non-terpenoid components. Stem essential oil contained one monoterpene, 23 oxygenated monoterpene, 2 sesquiterpene, and 6 oxygenated sesquiterpene hydrocarbons. The MIC value of stem essential oil was 2.85 mg/mL against both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa which was inhibited at 22.75 mg/mL. The MIC values of leaf and flower essential oils were higher than 5.69 and 22.75 mg/mL, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study highlighted the strong antibacterial effect of Ferula cupularis's essential oil which might be due to its high content of oxygenated monoterpene hydrocarbons. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that this plant may be a good candidate for further biological and pharmacological investigations.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the non-volatile phenolic fraction from rosemary leaves.
AB  - In this study, the aim was to evaluate the antimicrobial action of the non-volatile phenols of rosemary leaves against two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Three extracts with different phenolic compositions were tested. By the agar disc diffusion method, Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to the extracts, and S. epidermidis showed the highest inhibition zones. Overall, all the extracts tested by the broth dilution method showed higher activity than results from the agar disc diffusion method. The minimal bactericidal concentration values indicated that E. coli was the most susceptible strain. This study demonstrated that the flavonoidic fraction of rosemary leaves does not play a crucial role as antimicrobial agents against these microorganisms. The most active extract was characterised by the highest amount of non-volatile terpenoidic compounds.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an anti-pseudomonal dichlorocarbazol derivative displaying anti-biofilm activity.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains resistant towards all currently available antibiotics are increasingly encountered, raising the need for new anti-pseudomonal drugs. We therefore conducted a medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule collection resulting in the identification of the N-alkylated 3,6-dihalogenocarbazol 1-(sec-butylamino)-3-(3,6-dichloro-9H-carbazol-9-yl)propan-2-ol (MIC = 18.5 mug mL(-)(1)). This compound, compound 1, is bacteriostatic towards a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa. Importantly, 1 also eradicates mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa. 1 displays no cytotoxicity against various human cell types, pointing to its potential for further development as a novel antibacterial drug.
TI  - Defensins from the tick Ixodes scapularis are effective against phytopathogenic fungi and the human bacterial pathogen Listeria grayi.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ixodes scapularis is the most common tick species in North America and a vector of important pathogens that cause diseases in humans and animals including Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Tick defensins have been identified as a new source of antimicrobial agents with putative medical applications due to their wide-ranging antimicrobial activities. Two multigene families of defensins were previously reported in I. scapularis. The objective of the present study was to characterise the potential antimicrobial activity of two defensins from I. scapularis with emphasis on human pathogenic bacterial strains and important phytopathogenic fungi. METHODS: Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 mature peptides were chemically synthesised. In vitro antimicrobial assays were performed to test the activity of these two defensins against species of different bacterial genera including Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria spp. as well as Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa along with two plant-pathogenic fungi from the genus Fusarium. In addition, the tissue-specific expression patterns of Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 in I. scapularis midgut, salivary glands and embryo-derived cell lines were determined using PCR. Finally, tertiary structures of the two defensins were predicted and structural analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Scapularisin-6 efficiently killed L. grayi, and both Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 caused strong inhibition (IC50 value: ~1 muM) of the germination of plant-pathogenic fungi Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium graminearum. Scapularisin-6 gene expression was observed in I. scapularis salivary glands and midgut. However, Scapularisin-3 gene expression was only detected in the salivary glands. Transcripts from the two defensins were not found in the I. scapularis tick cell lines ISE6 and ISE18. CONCLUSION: Our results have two main implications. Firstly, the anti-Listeria and antifungal activities of Scapularisin-3 and Scapularisin-6 suggest that these peptides may be useful for (i) treatment of antibiotic-resistant L. grayi in humans and (ii) plant protection. Secondly, the antimicrobial properties of the two defensins described in this study may pave the way for further studies regarding pathogen invasion and innate immunity in I. scapularis.
TI  - Blood stream infections in renal transplant recipients: a single-center study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacteremias among renal transplant recipients are more frequent as  a result of immunosuppression. They are considered extremely high-risk because they are correlated with decreased allograft and recipient survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia among renal transplant recipients were documented following review of medical records, from January 2010 to May 2013. RESULTS: In total 26 episodes of bacteremia were observed in 22 patients. Gram negative bacteremia was identified in 73% (19/26) cases. Pathogens according to their frequency were the following Escherichia coli (6/26, 23%), Klebsiella pneumonia (5/26, 19%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3/26, 11%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3/26, 11%), Acinetobacter baumanni (2/26, 7.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (2/26, 7.7%). The first trimester post renal transplantation 18 episodes (69%) of bacteremia were presented that were not correlated to indwelling urinary catheter or stent. Positive urinary culture with the same pathogen was recognized in 13 patients. All recipients manifested fever, eight recipients had leucocytosis and three cases were complicated by septic shock. Immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids and non-nephrotoxic antibiotic regimen was initiated. Acute renal allograft dysfunction (defined as an increase in serum creatinine more than 0.5 mg/dL from baseline) was observed in five patients and was restored following infection resolution. CONCLUSION: Increased prevalence of bacteremia in renal transplant recipients is attributed to immunosuppression and usually bacteremic episodes follow urinary tract infection. The commonest pathogens are Gram negative bacteria with E. coli the most frequent. Early detection and proper management are important as bacteremia affects renal allograft and recipient survival.
TI  - Essential oil of Eucalyptus gunnii hook. As a novel source of antioxidant, antimutagenic and antibacterial agents.
AB  - The present study describes radical scavenging capacity (RSC), antimutagenic and  antibacterial properties of the essential oil (EO) of the leaves of Eucalyptus gunnii Hook. (Southern Montenegro). Chemical composition was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In oil, 1,8-cineole (67.8%) and alpha-pinene (14.12%) were the major compounds comprising almost 82% of total EO. EO exhibited moderate DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging activity, with IC50 value of 7.19 microL/mL. The antimutagenic properties were assayed against the spontaneous and t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli IC202 oxyR mutant strain, deficient in removing radical oxygen species (ROS). Reduction of the spontaneous mutagenesis in the presence of E. gunnii EO was only slight, up to 12% at the highest concentration tested. However, when the oxidative mutagen was used, EO displayed more significant reduction of mutagenesis (maximum 23%) in a concentration dependent manner. Antibacterial activity was tested against the selected strains from ATTC and NCIB collections: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus flavus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the two Escherichia coli strains from our laboratory collection (SY252 and IB112) using both the disk-diffusion and MIC assays. The greatest sensitivity was shown by M. flavus, K. pneumoniae and E. coli lpcA (MIC = 0.83 mg/mL), while the highest resistance was shown by E. coli (ATTC 25922) and S. epidermidis. This study represents the first report on chemical composition and biological activity of the Eucalyptus gunnii in the South Balkan region and beyond.
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in pediatric hematology/oncology patients after anticancer chemotherapy.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology and oncology represent a  major problem worldwide, but this has not been studied in Qatar. In this study, we investigated the burden of infection and the resistance pattern in the bacterial etiology, in the only tertiary pediatric hematology and oncology center in Qatar. METHODS: All pediatric cancer patients (n=185) were evaluated retrospectively during the period 2004-2011; a total of 70 (38%) patients were diagnosed with bloodstream infections. Bacterial etiology was determined, along with their susceptibility patterns. Neutropenia, duration of neutropenia, fever, duration of fever, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated throughout the study. RESULTS: A total of 70 patients (38%) were diagnosed with acute leukemias, lymphomas, solid tumors, or brain tumors; those patients experienced 111 episodes of bacteremia. The most common Gram-positive (n=64 [55%]) isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=26), Staphylococcus hominis (n=9), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=7), and the common Gram-negative (n=52 [45%]) isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10), and Escherichia coli (n=7). There was a significant association observed between fever with positive blood culture and different types of cancer (P=0.035). The majority of bacteremia (n=68 [61.3%]) occurred in nonneutropenic episodes. Elevated values of CRP (>/=5 mg/L) were detected in 82 (95.3%) episodes and were negatively correlated with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (r=-0.18; P=0.248) among all cases. However, the infection-related fatality rate was 2.2% (n=4), with three caused by Gram-negative pathogens. Multidrug resistant organisms were implicated in 33 (28.4%) cases and caused three of the mortality cases. CONCLUSION: Multidrug resistant organisms cause mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Investigation of antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms may guide successful antimicrobial therapy and improve the surveillance and quality of pediatric malignancy care.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic assay kit using fluorescent silica nanoparticles for rapid diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis.
AB  - We developed an immunochromatographic assay kit that uses fluorescent silica nanoparticles bound to anti-Acanthamoeba antibodies (fluorescent immunochromatographic assay [FICGA]) and evaluated its efficacy for the detection of Acanthamoeba and diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK). The sensitivity of the FICGA kit was evaluated using samples of Acanthamoeba trophozoites and cysts diluted to various concentrations. A conventional immunochromatographic assay kit with latex labels (LICGA) was also evaluated to determine its sensitivity in detecting Acanthamoeba trophozoites. To check for cross-reactivity, the FICGA was performed by using samples of other common causative pathogens of infectious keratitis, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans. Corneal scrapings from patients with suspected AK were tested with the FICGA kit to detect the presence of Acanthamoeba, and the results were compared with those of real-time PCR. The FICGA kit detected organisms at concentrations as low as 5 trophozoites or 40 cysts per sample. There were no cross-reactivities with other pathogens. The FICGA was approximately 20 times more sensitive than the LICGA for the detection of Acanthamoeba trophozoites. The FICGA kit yielded positive results for all 10 patients, which corresponded well with the real-time PCR results. The FICGA kit demonstrated high sensitivity for the detection of Acanthamoeba and may be useful for the diagnosis of AK.
TI  - Infectious Keratitis Following Corneal Crosslinking: A Systematic Review of Reported Cases: Management, Visual Outcome, and Treatment Proposed.
AB  - Abstract Aim: To describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. Methods: A Medline (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA) search from October 2000 to October 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. Nineteen articles were selected. Ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. Nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in German, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. Results: A total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. The infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus S. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (E. coli; P. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (Fusarium and Microsporidia) (20%), and Acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). Conclusions: Only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. The most virulent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acanthamoeba. Less virulent organisms were Escherichia coli and S. epidermidis. Two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. The most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.
TI  - Chemical composition and anti-biofilm activity of Thymus sipyleus BOISS. subsp. sipyleus BOISS. var. davisianus RONNIGER essential oil.
AB  - In this study, antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the chemical composition of Thymus sipyleus BOISS. subsp. sipyleus BOISS. var. davisianus RONNIGER essential oil was evaluated. The essential oil was obtained by hydro-distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fourteen compounds were characterized, having as major components thymol (38.31 %) and carvacrol (37.95 %). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oil and the major components were calculated by serial dilution method, and anti-biofilm effects by microplate biofilm assay against five Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus MU 38, MU 40, MU 46, MU 47, Stahylococcus epidermidis MU 30) and five Gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa MU 187, MU 188, MU 189, Pseudomonas fluorescens MU 180, MU 181) bacteria. It was found that MICs for essential oil, thymol and carvacrol were between 5 and 50 microl/ml, 0.125-0.5 microg/ml and 0.125-05 microl/ml, respectively. The results showed that doses of MIC produced a greater anti-biofilm influence than 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 MIC. In the presence of essential oil (MIC), the mean biofilm formation value was equal to 67 +/- 5.5 % for P. aeruginosa MU 188, and essential oil (MIC) inhibition exceeds 60 % for P. aeruginosa biofilms. The results also showed that carvacrol (MIC) was able to induce an inhibition 72.9 +/- 4.1 % for S.aureus (MU 40) biofilm. In addition, thymol (MIC) showed 68.6 +/- 5.3 % reduction in biofilm formation of P. fluorescens MU 181. This study demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity of T. sipyleus BOISS. subsp. sipyleus BOISS. var. davisianus RONNIGER essential oil and points out the exceptional efficiency of thymol and carvacrol, which could represent candidates in the treatment of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus biofilms.
TI  - Etiologic diagnosis and clinical treatment of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia after neurosurgery.
AB  - Our objective is to analyze the etiology and antibiotics resistance rate of multiple drug-resistant bacteria infection in elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia from Neurosurgery Department, providing a reference for clinical treatment. Sputum of 372 elderly patients with stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) from Neurosurgery Department was collected for sputum culture and drug sensitivity test, and pathogenic bacteria distribution and drug resistance rate of antibiotics were discussed. Among 372 pathogenic bacteria, there were 95 cases with Gram-positive cocci, the percentage was 15.32 %; there were 277 cases with Gram-negative bacilli, the percentage was 59.95 %; there were 54 cases with fungus, the percentage was 14.51 %; the common Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with percentages of 15.32 %, 2.96 % and 4.30 % respectively; the common Gram-negative bacilli included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with percentages of 23.92 %, 14.25 % and 9.95 % respectively; the highest drug resistance rates of Staphylococcus aureus were 100.00 % to penicillin, erythrocin and oxacillin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 87.50 % to erythrocin, the highest drug resistance rate of Staphylococcus haemolyticus was 100.00 % to penicillin and erythrocin, the lowest drug resistance rates of three Gram-negative bacilli were 0 % to teicoplanin and vancomycin; the highest drug resistance rates of Escherichia coli were 100.00 % to ceftriaxone and ticarcillin, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 11.32 % to ciprofloxacin; the highest drug resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100.00 % to ceftriaxone, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 22.47 % to imipenem; the highest drug resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was 81.08 % to aztreonam, and the lowest drug resistance rate was 0.00 % to imipenem. Stroke-associated pneumonia is common clinically in elderly patients from Neurology Department, the early-stage and rational use of antibiotics should be applied according to the etiologic distribution and drug resistance characteristics. Meanwhile, prevention measures should be applied.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological characteristic of infectious purulent complications in patients after related renal transplantation].
AB  - We investigated the frequency and characteristics of infectious purulent and non-infectious complications in living related renal transplant recipients in early postoperative period. It was identified the prevalent microorganisms in urinary tract infections and its antibiotic sensitivity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans. 182 strains of bacteria and Candida were isolated from urine of renal graft patients in early postoperative period (from 2 days to 3 months). The prevention and treatment schemes, antimicrobial drugs dosing regimen were developed. It leads to decrease the infectious complications rate.
TI  - Identification of causative pathogens in mouse eyes with bacterial keratitis by sequence analysis of 16S rDNA libraries.
AB  - The clone library method using PCR amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)  gene was used to identify pathogens from corneal scrapings of C57BL/6-corneal opacity (B6-Co) mice with bacterial keratitis. All 10 samples from the eyes with bacterial keratitis showed positive PCR results. All 10 samples from the normal cornea showed negative PCR results. In all 10 PCR-positive samples, the predominant and second most predominant species accounted for 20.9 to 40.6% and 14.7 to 26.1%, respectively, of each clone library. The predominant species were Staphylococcus lentus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The microbiota analysis detected a diverse group of microbiota in the eyes of B6-Co mice with bacterial keratitis and showed that the causative pathogens could be determined based on percentages of bacterial species in the clone libraries. The bacterial species detected in this study were mostly in accordance with results of studies on clinical bacterial keratitis in human eyes. Based on the results of our previous studies and this study, the B6-Co mouse should be considered a favorable model for studying bacterial keratitis.
TI  - Antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oil extracted from Laurus nobilis growing in Lebanon.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the extracts of Laurus nobilis against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444) and two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853). Also, the antibiofilm activity has been investigated against the biofilm produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP 444. MATERIALS: The polysaccharides, essential oil, and fatty oils extracted from the plant were used in broth microdilution methods to study the minimal inhibitory concentration, and then the minimal bactericidal concentration was determined. RESULTS: The results showed that alginate, fucoidan, fatty oils and essential oil have good antibacterial activities against the 5 bacterial strains, and a negligible biofilm eradication activity of fucoidan, laminaran, fatty oil, and essential oil was observed, but a promising biofilm eradication activity was obtained with alginate, which showed a reduced biofilm mass even at low concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The extracts obtained have promising antibacterial capacities which need further investigation for them to be incorporated in medical or nutritional applications.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fermented Theobroma cacao pod husk extract.
AB  - Theobroma cacao L. contains more than 500 different chemical compounds some of which have been traditionally used for their antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, immunomodulatory, vasodilatory, analgesic, and antimicrobial activities. Spontaneous aerobic fermentation of cacao husks yields a crude husk extract (CHE) with antimicrobial activity. CHE was fractioned by solvent partition with polar solvent extraction or by silica gel chromatography and a total of 12 sub-fractions were analyzed for chemical composition and bioactivity. CHE was effective against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the basidiomycete Moniliophthora perniciosa. Antibacterial activity was determined using 6 strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella choleraesuis (Gram-negative). At doses up to 10 mg/mL, CHE was not effective against the Gram-positive bacteria tested but against medically important P. aeruginosa and S. choleraesuis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5.0 mg/mL. Sub-fractions varied widely in activity and strongest antibacterial activity was seen with CHE8 against S. choleraesuis (MIC of 1.0 mg/mL) and CHE9 against S. epidermidis (MIC of 2.5 mg/mL). All bioactive CHE fractions contained phenols, steroids, or terpenes, but no saponins. Fraction CHE9 contained flavonoids, phenolics, steroids, and terpenes, amino acids, and alkaloids, while CHE12 had the same compounds but lacked flavonoids.
TI  - Oral administration of the broad-spectrum antibiofilm compound toremifene inhibits Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation in vivo.
AB  - We here report on the in vitro activity of toremifene to inhibit biofilm formation of different fungal and bacterial pathogens, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida dubliniensis, Candida krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We validated the in vivo efficacy of orally administered toremifene against C. albicans and S. aureus biofilm formation in a rat subcutaneous catheter model. Combined, our results demonstrate the potential of toremifene as a broad-spectrum oral antibiofilm compound.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of acylide derivatives bearing an aryl-tetrazolyl chain.
AB  - Seventeen acylides bearing an aryl-tetrazolyl alkyl-substituted side chain were synthesized, starting from clarithromycin, via several reactions including hydrolysis, acetylating, esterification, carbamylation, and Michael addition. The structures of all new compounds were confirmed by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. All these synthesized acylides were evaluated for in vitro antimicrobial activities against gram-positive pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), using the broth microdilution method. Results showed that compounds 10 e, 10 f, 10 g, 10 h, 10 o have good antibacterial activities.
TI  - False negative beta-2 transferrin in the diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid leak in the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objectives of this study were to examine the presence  of beta-2 transferrin (beta2TRNSF) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contaminated in vitro by various bacteria and explore the mechanism (passive or active) responsible for beta2TRNSF elimination. Early diagnosis of CSF leakage may change treatment decisions and minimize the risk of meningitis and encephalitis. beta2TRNSF is a protein present exclusively in CSF. Its detection is highly useful in cases of CSF leakage, although it has never been examined in the presence of central nervous system infection. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective patient analysis. METHODS: Sterile CSF drawn from patients was contaminated in vitro with several microorganisms chosen for their ability to cause neurosurgical-related infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. beta2TRNSF was examined at two time points: following immediate inoculation (t0) and following an overnight incubation (t18) over various bacterial concentrations. Samples of CSF inoculated with S pneumoniae were also examined in the presence of ciprofloxacin. For beta2TRNSF analysis we used immunoblotting electrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: CSF samples collected from nine patients were analyzed. beta2TRNSF was not detected following S pneumoniae inoculation at both time points when immunoblotting electrophoresis was used. Quantitative analysis using ELISA demonstrated significant beta2TRNSF concentration decrease. The addition of ciprofloxacin led to the same results. CONCLUSIONS: CSF leak detection using beta2TRNSF may be deceiving in the presence of a S pneumoniae cerebral nervous system infection. A passive process is suggested, as beta2TRNSF disappeared either immediately or following incubation with inactive bacteria.
TI  - [Etiology of surgical site infections in orthopedic surgery after multiple injuries].
AB  - Surgical site infection is one of the most severe complications in patients with  multiple injuries. It causes elongation of hospitalization time, greatly increases costs of treatment and may directly endanger patient's life. The aim of the study was to analyze bacterial flora causing surgical site infections in group of patients with multiple injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical history of 31 patients with multiple injuries, who in years 2011-2012 due to surgical site infections required further treatment in Department of Musculoskeletal System Infections. RESULTS: In analyzed material majority of infections were caused by multiple bacteria species--18 (58%). Throughout the isolated flora the most frequent were gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumanii--16 (29.6%) and P. areuginosa--5 (9.3%). Participation of gram-positive flora which until now was dominating as a cause of musculoskeletal system infections, has significantly decreased. Additionally, in this group we can see dominance of bacteria from Enterococcus genus--E. fecalis--10 (18.5%), and not as it used to be from Staphylococcus--S. aureus--6 (11%), S. epidermidis--3 (5.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common were acute infections caused by multiple bacteria species with dominance of gram-negative flora. Very interesting is the fact of fall of infection rate caused by Staphylococci. Monitoring of bacterial etiological factors has a key role in proper antibiotic administration, with is essential in successful surgical treatment.
TI  - Monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. Monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's abdomen. Milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. Using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel Monotreme Lactation Protein (MLP) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. We show that platypus and short-beaked echidna MLP genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. The MLP transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. Analysis of recombinant MLP showed that it is an N-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that MLP is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein, a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. Functional analysis revealed MLP antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus and commensal Enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Salmonella enterica. Our data suggest that MLP is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. We propose that MLP evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a new series of N-acyldiamines as potential antibacterial and antifungal agents.
AB  - In continuation of our efforts to find new antimicrobial compounds, series of fatty N-acyldiamines were prepared from fatty methyl esters and 1,2-ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine or 1,4-butanediamine. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and for their antifungal activity against four species of Candida (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis). Compounds 5a (N-(2-aminoethyl)dodecanamide), 5b (N-(2-aminoethyl)tetracanamide) and 6d (N-(3-aminopropyl)oleamide) were the most active against Gram-positive bacteria, with MIC values ranging from 1 to 16mug/mL and were evaluated for their activity against 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All the compounds exhibited good to moderate antifungal activity. Compared to chloramphenicol, compound 6b displayed a similar activity (MIC50=16mug/mL). A positive correlation could be established between lipophilicity and biological activity.
TI  - Influence of poly-N-acetylglucosamine in the extracellular matrix on N-chlorotaurine mediated killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - N-chlorotaurine (NCT) has recently been shown to have bactericidal activity against bacterial biofilm on metal discs (Coraca-Huber et al., 2014). In a biofilm, Staphylococcus epidermidis polymerizes poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG) to form an extracellular matrix (ECM). Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not express this PNAG and has been shown to be highly susceptible to NCT. We compared the action of NCT on S. epidermidis 1457, a PNAG positive strain (SE1457) and S. epidermidis 1457- M10 an isogenic PNAG negative mutant (SE1457 M10). NCT-mediated killing was more effective and quicker on the PNAG negative strain SE1457 M10. Bacteria hidden in biofilms for prolonged periods of time were generally more susceptible than freshly formed biofilms. The differences in NCT-mediated killing might not be direct effects since NCT did not react with the monomeric N-acetylglucosamine, but might be explained by denser growth in the PNAG-containing biofilm produced by the wild type strain, which results in delayed penetration of NCT. The higher susceptibility of older biofilms to NCTmediated killing could be explained by more pronounced 3D architecture and subsequent larger surface area for interactions with NCT.
TI  - A Study on the Nature of Association between Demodex Mites and Bacteria Involved  in Skin and Meibomian Gland Lesions of Demodectic Mange in Cattle.
AB  - The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria involved in bovine demodectic mange lesions and the normal flora inhabiting the skin of noninfected animals was investigated. Demodex bovis and D. ghanensis mites were isolated from the infected purulent material extracted from skin and meibomian gland lesions, respectively. The mites could not be demonstrated in skin brushings or impression smears from the eyes of noninfected cattle. Pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A)) and opportunistic organisms (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Trueperella pyogenes) were isolated from skin lesions of demodectic mange, and Moraxella bovis and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from meibomian gland lesions. Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A) were isolated from skin brushings from noninfected cattle. The nature of association between Demodex mites and bacteria in demodectic mange lesions is synergistic and of equal significance. Pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria facilitated the establishment of Demodex mites in the lesions produced and provided an excellent microclimate for the mites to propagate and reproduce, resulting in severe and progressive disease. The "high-turnover" granulomatous reaction which characterized the histopathological changes proved that Demodex mites and associated bacteria were persistent and immunogenic.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - A refined technique for extraction of extracellular matrices from bacterial biofilms and its applicability.
AB  - Biofilm-forming bacteria embedded in polymeric extracellular matrices (ECMs) that consist of polysaccharides, proteins and/or extracellular DNAs (eDNAs) acquire high resistance to antimicrobial agents and host immune systems. To understand molecular mechanisms of biofilm formation and maintenance and to develop therapeutic countermeasures against chronic biofilm-associated infections, reliable methods to isolate ECMs are inevitable. In this study, we refined the ECM extraction method recently reported and evaluated its applicability. Using three Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in which proteins, polysaccharides or eDNAs are major contributors to their integrity, ECMs were extracted using salts and detergents. We found that extraction with 1.5 M sodium chloride (NaCl) could be optimum for not only ECM proteins but also polysaccharides and eDNAs. In addition, long-time incubation was not necessary for efficient ECM isolation. Lithium chloride (LiCl) was comparative to NaCl but is more expensive. In contrast to SDS, NaCl hardly caused leakage of intracellular proteins and did not affect viability of bacterial cells within biofilms. Furthermore, this method is applicable to other bacteria such as Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, this refined method is very simple, rapid, low cost and non-invasive and could be used for a broad range of applications.
TI  - Decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract of cultivated thyme: antioxidant and antibacterial activities, and phenolic characterisation.
AB  - Bioactivity of thyme has been described, but mostly related to its essential oils, while studies with aqueous extracts are scarce. Herein, the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of decoction, infusion and hydroalcoholic extract, as also their phenolic compounds, were evaluated and compared. Decoction showed the highest concentration of phenolic compounds (either phenolic acids or flavonoids), followed by infusion and hydroalcoholic extract. In general, the samples were effective against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter sakazakii) bacteria, with decoction presenting the most pronounced effect. This sample also displayed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. Data obtained support the idea that compounds with strong antioxidant and antibacterial activities are also water-soluble. Furthermore, the use of thyme infusion and decoction, by both internal and external use, at recommended doses, is safe and no adverse reactions have been described.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity of Holothuria leucospilota Isolated From Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antimicrobial resistance toward a number of conventional antibiotics has triggered the search for antimicrobial agents from a variety of sources including the marine environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Holothuria leucospilota from Qeshm and Kharg Islands against some selected bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, sea cucumbers from two coastal cities of Persian Gulf were collected in March and May 2011 and identified by the scale method according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Antibacterial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of the body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid, methanol, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts of the body wall were evaluated by the spot test. In addition, their antifungal activity was assessed by the broth dilution method. RESULTS: The displayed effect was microbiostatic at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 microg/mL rather than microbicidal. The highest activity of hydroalcoholic extracts was exhibited by body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis. However, none of the methanol, chloroform and n-haxane extracts showed appreciable effects against Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. Moreover, cuvierian organs did not possess any antifungal potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that water-methanol extracts from the body wall of H. leucospilota possess antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, additional and in-depth studies are required to isolate and identify the active component(s).
TI  - A simple and effective method to synthesize fluorescent nanoparticles using tryptophan and light and their lethal effect against bacteria.
AB  - A simple, environmentally friendly and cost-effective method was used to synthesize silver nanoparticles using tryptophan and light. To prepare the nanoparticles, the following components were used: deionized water, silver nitrate, light and tryptophan. The effects of the tryptophan concentration and light exposure time on the formation of tryptophan silver nanoparticles (Tnnps) were studied. The synthesized Tnnps were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements. The synthesized Tnnps were nearly spherical, with sizes of approximately 17 nm. In addition, the antibacterial activity of Tnnps was determined by monitoring the growth curves of strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus faecalis using the microdilution test. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) for 4 of 5 tested bacteria was determined to be between 20.0 and 17.5 mug/mL for 48 h and between 22.5 and 20.0 mug/mL for 72 h.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - A microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMF-T), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. METHOD: Included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. The children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental treatments during this trial. The distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. After performing a survey for the education, occupation, and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. The children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine) for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of each week. The 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. RESULTS: The decrease in the DMF-T index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. Of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia Coli, Pseudomonas aeuroginosa, Enterococcus spp, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Except for Candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. In the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. Moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria and viruses using two monosubstituted zinc(II) phthalocyanines.
AB  - A zinc(II) phthalocyanine substituted with a triamino moiety and its tri-N-methylated analogue have been prepared and characterized with various spectroscopic methods. Both compounds remain non-aggregated in N,N-dimethylformamide and in water containing 0.05% Cremophor EL (v/v), and can generate singlet oxygen effectively. The photodynamic activities of these compounds have been examined against a range of bacterial strains, including the Gram-positive methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-43, and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Both photosensitizers are highly cytotoxic, particularly for the two Gram-positive strains, for which as low as 5 nM of dye is required to induce a 4-log reduction of their viability. The tri-N-methylated derivative has also been shown to be able to effectively inhibit the growth of a series of clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and biofilms of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 67928 and ATCC 68507, and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984. In addition, the photodynamic inactivation of a range of viruses using these two compounds has also been investigated. Both compounds are highly photocytotoxic against the enveloped viruses influenza A virus (H1N1) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), but exhibit no significant cytotoxicity toward the non-enveloped viruses adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and coxsackievirus (Cox B1).
TI  - [A prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (CRI). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from January 2012 to January 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score reaching 10-29. The patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. Norvancomycin and heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). The incidence of CRI, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. RESULTS: (1) There was no significant difference in the incidence of CRI between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000]. There was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) A total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. Three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and Acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. There was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all P>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of Gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) There was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, P=0.806]. (4) There were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, P=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, P=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand Yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, P=1.560) between intervention group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of CRI, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, Resilon/RealSeal (RS). To determine if RS is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show RS degradation. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Emulsions of RS were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. Lipase PS served as a positive control. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade RS. The bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for RS degradation for 7 days. RESULTS: Degradation of the emulsified RS manifested in the formation of clear zones around P aeruginosa, P intermedia, P asaccharolytica, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain RS emulsion. CONCLUSION: Endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade RS. These findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with RS may be impaired by a microbial insult.
TI  - Jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome P450 biomimetic model for the metabolism of monensin A.
AB  - Monensin A is a commercially important natural product isolated from Streptomyces cinnamonensins that is primarily employed to treat coccidiosis. Monensin A selectively complexes and transports sodium cations across lipid membranes and displays a variety of biological properties. In this study, we evaluated the Jacobsen catalyst as a cytochrome P450 biomimetic model to investigate the oxidation of monensin A. Mass spectrometry analysis of the products from these model systems revealed the formation of two products: 3-O-demethyl monensin A and 12-hydroxy monensin A, which are the same ones found in in vivo models. Monensin A and products obtained in biomimetic model were tested in a mitochondrial toxicity model assessment and an antimicrobial bioassay against Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus methicillin-resistant, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Our results demonstrated the toxicological effects of monensin A in isolated rat liver mitochondria but not its products, showing that the metabolism of monensin A is a detoxification metabolism. In addition, the antimicrobial bioassay showed that monensin A and its products possessed activity against Gram-positive microorganisms but not for Gram-negative microorganisms. The results revealed the potential of application of this biomimetic chemical model in the synthesis of drug metabolites, providing metabolites for biological tests and other purposes.
TI  - Effect of algae and plant lectins on planktonic growth and biofilm formation in clinically relevant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the abilities of plant and algae lectins to inhibit  planktonic growth and biofilm formation in bacteria and yeasts. Initially, ten lectins were tested on Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and C. tropicalis at concentrations of 31.25 to 250 mu g/mL. The lectins from Cratylia floribunda (CFL), Vatairea macrocarpa (VML), Bauhinia bauhinioides (BBL), Bryothamnion seaforthii (BSL), and Hypnea musciformis (HML) showed activities against at least one microorganism. Biofilm formation in the presence of the lectins was also evaluated; after 24 h of incubation with the lectins, the biofilms were analyzed by quantifying the biomass (by crystal violet staining) and by enumerating the viable cells (colony-forming units). The lectins reduced the biofilm biomass and/or the number of viable cells to differing degrees depending on the microorganism tested, demonstrating the different characteristics of the lectins. These findings indicate that the lectins tested in this study may be natural alternative antimicrobial agents; however, further studies are required to better elucidate the functional use of these proteins.
TI  - Comparison of scanning electron microscopy findings regarding biofilm colonization with microbiological results in nasolacrimal stents for external, endoscopic and transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy.
AB  - AIM: To compare bacterial biofilm colonization in lacrimal stents following external dacryocystorhinostomy (EX-DCR), endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (EN-DCR), and transcanalicular dacryocystorhinostomy (TC-DCR) with multidiode laser. METHODS: This prospective study included 30 consecutive patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction who underwent EXT-, EN-, or TC-DCR. Thirty removed lacrimal stent fragments and conjunctival samples were cultured. The lacrimal stent biofilms were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Eleven (36.7%) of the 30 lacrimal stent cultures were positive for aerobic bacteria (most commonly Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). However anaerobic bacteria and fungi were not identified in the lacrimal stent cultures. Twenty-seven (90%) patients had biofilm-positive lacrimal stents. The conjunctival culture positivity after the DCR, biofilm positivity on stents, the grade of biofilm colonization, and the presence of mucus and coccoid and rod-shaped organisms did not significantly differ between any of the groups (P>0.05). However, a significant difference was found when the SEM results were compared to the results of the lacrimal stent and conjunctival cultures (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Type of dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgery did not affect the biofilm colonization of the lacrimal stents. SEM also appears to be more precise than microbiological culture for evaluating the presence of biofilms on lacrimal stents.
TI  - Prevention of transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms during catheter exchange using antimicrobial catheters.
AB  - Exchanging a central venous catheter (CVC) over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated CVC in the presence of bacteremia can result in cross-infection of the newly exchanged CVC. A recent retrospective clinical study showed that exchanging a catheter over a guide wire in the presence of bacteremia using an antimicrobial minocycline-rifampin (M/R) catheter may improve outcomes. To expand on this, we developed an in vitro cross-contamination model of exchange to evaluate the efficacy of different antimicrobial CVCs in preventing cross-contamination of multidrug-resistant organisms during exchange. Uncoated CVCs were allowed to form biofilm by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. After 24 h, the biofilm-colonized CVCs were placed in a glass tube containing bovine calf serum plus Mueller-Hinton broth, and each catheter was exchanged over a guide wire for a fresh uncoated or an M/R-, chlorhexidine-silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS)-, or chlorhexidine-M/R (CHX-M/R)-coated CVC. Cross-contamination of exchanged catheters was enumerated by sonication and quantitative plating methods. The exchange of M/R CVCs completely prevented cross-contamination by MRSA biofilms compared to control exchanged CVCs (P<0.0001). Exchange with CHX/SS CVCs reduced but did not completely prevent cross-contamination by MRSA (P=0.005). Exchange with CHX-M/R CVCs completely prevented cross-contamination by MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans biofilms (P<0.0001). Furthermore, CHX-M/R CVCs were superior to M/R CVCs against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans (P=0.003) and were superior to CHX/SS CVCs against MRSA and P. aeruginosa (P=0.01). In conclusion, exchange with the novel CHX-M/R CVC was the only exchange effective in completely and concurrently preventing cross-contamination from bacteria and Candida.
TI  - Postoperative nosocomial infections among children with congenital heart disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogen distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and risk factors of postoperative nosocomial infections among children with congenital heart disease. METHODS: Three hundreds children with congenital heart disease admitted to our hospital to receive surgeries from February 2010 to February 2013 were selected. RESULTS: A total of 120 children were tested as positive by sputum culture, with the infection rate of 40.0%. The top five most common pathogenic microorganisms included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Enterococcus were highly resistant to penicillin, azithromycin and erythromycin, moderately susceptible to levofloxacin and cefazolin, and completely susceptible to vancomycin. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that hospitalization stay length, combined use of antibiotics, systemic use of hormones, mechanical ventilation and catheter indwelling were the independent risk factors of postoperative nosocomial infections (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Nosocomial infection, which was the most frequent postoperative complication of pediatric congenital heart disease, was predominantly induced by Gram-positive bacteria that were highly susceptible to cephalosporins and vancomycin. Particular attention should be paid to decrease relevant risk factors to improve the prognosis.
TI  - Enzymatic treatment of specimens before DNA extraction directly influences molecular detection of infectious agents.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Biological samples, pharmaceuticals or food contain proteins, lipids, polymers, ammoniums and macromolecules that alter the detection of infectious agents by DNA amplification techniques (PCR). Moreover the targeted DNA has to be released from the complex cell walls and the compact nucleoprotein matrixes and cleared from potential inhibitors. The goal of the present work was to assess the efficiency of enzymatic pretreatments on infectious agents to make DNA available for further extraction and amplification. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani were mixed with an internal control virus and treated with: 1) proteinase K; 2) lyticase and 3) lyticase followed by proteinase K. DNAs was manually extracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit or the MagNA Pure Compact automate. DNA extraction yields and the inhibitors were assessed with a phocid Herpesvirus. Bacterial detection was performed using TaqMan real-time PCR and yeasts and filamentous Fungi with HRM (real-time PCR followed by high-resolution melting analysis). RESULTS: Viral DNA was released, extracted and detected using manual and automatic methods without pre enzymatic treatments. Either the manual or the automatic DNA extraction systems did not meet the sensitivity expectations if enzymatic treatments were not performed before: lyticase for Fungi and Proteinase K for Bacteria. The addition of lyticase and proteinase K did not improve results. For Fungi the detection after lyticase was higher than for Proteinase K, for which melting analysis did not allow fungal specification. DISCUSSION: Columns and magnetic beads allowed collecting DNA and separate PCR inhibitors. Detection rates cannot be related to DNA-avidity of beads or to elution but to the lack of proteolysis.
TI  - Preparation of melt-spun antimicrobially modified LDH/polyolefin nanocomposite fibers.
AB  - Layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized and organically modified with camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and ciprofloxacin. The thermal stability of CSA was improved remarkably under LDH shielding. A minimal inhibitory concentration of free CSA against tested bacteria was determined in order to define the essential quantity in LDH modification. The modified LDHs were melt-compounded with high density polyethylene and the prepared nanocomposites were further melt-spun using a piston-type spinning device. The melt-spun fibers were tested for their antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. CSA integrated fibers show susceptibility against Gram-positive bacteria and ciprofloxacin integrated fibers showed activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Nosocomial pathogens associated with the mobile phones of healthcare workers in a hospital in Anyigba, Kogi state, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile phones of healthcare workers (HCWs) could be colonized by potential bacteria pathogens. The aim of this research is to evaluate the bacterial contamination and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of isolates from mobile phones of HCWs in Grimad hospital. METHOD: A total of 112 swab samples were collected from the mobile phones of HCWs and students in June 2012 in Anyigba. While 56 samples were from HCWs in Grimad hospital, 56 samples were obtained from non-healthcare workers (NHCWs) who served as the control. The samples were all screened for bacterial pathogens by standard bacteriological procedures. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by the disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: The rate of bacterial contamination of mobile phones of HCWs was 94.6%. Bacteria isolated from mobile phones of HCWs were more resistant to antibiotics than NHCWs phones. Staphylococcus Epidermidis (42.9%) was the most frequently isolated bacteria followed by Bacillus spp. (32.1%), Staphylococcus Aureus (25%), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (19.6%), Escherichia Coli (14.3%), Streptococcus spp. (14.3%), Proteus spp. (12.5%), Klebsiella spp. (7.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (5.3%). Cotrimoxazole, ampicillin and tetracycline showed high levels of resistance while gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone exhibited encouraging results. CONCLUSION: The presence of bacteria pathogens associated with nosocomial infection was identified. Transmission of pathogens can be reduced by hand hygiene and regular cleaning of mobile phones.
TI  - [Clinical distribution and antimicrobial resistance analysis of 754 pathogenic bacteria in diabetic foot infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibility  patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers so as to provide selection rationales of antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the microbiological profiles and antibiotic susceptibilities in 754 strains of pathogens isolated from 519 patients with diabetic foot ulcers at our hospital from January 2010 to August 2013. The inter-group data were compared by Chi-square test. RESULTS: There were 322 (62.0%) males and 197 (38.0%) females. Their mean age was (67.7 +/- 12.3) (30-93) years, duration of diabetes 10 (0-40) years, duration of lower-limb lesion 1.0 (0.0-72.0) months and HbA1c (9.09% +/- 2.28%). Among 444 (85.5%) cases, a total of 754 strains of pathogens were isolated. Gram-positive aerobes were the most frequently isolated (47.3%, 357 strains) and followed by gram-negative aerobes and fungus (40.3% vs 12.3%, 304 vs 93 strains respectively). With rising Wagner's grades, bacterial floras transformed from Gram-positive cocci to Gram-negative rods while fungus and composite infections increased. And 122 strains were of multi drug resistant organisms (MDRO). Among 357 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were dominating floras. Staphylococcus was highly resistant to penicillin G, erythromycin, and oxacillin while vancomycin and linezolid were the most effective agents against gram-positive bacteria. Among 304 strains of gram-negative bacteria, enterobacteria were the most prevalent, including 48 strains of Escherichia coli, 34 strains of Proteus mirabilis and 31 strains of Proteus vulgaris. And there were 29 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteria were highly resistant to ampicillin, followed by bactrim and furadantin while meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin/sulbactam, sulperazone and cefepime were the most effective agents. The predominant fungus was Blastomyces albicans. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe diabetic foot ulcers, Gram-negative rods predominate while the prevalence of fungus and composite infections increases. Vancomycin and imipenem maintain highly antibacterial activity. It is essential to pay attention to pathogen survey and use antibiotics more rationally.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bactericidal efficacy of alcohol solution during actual use and typical storage conditions in community hospital and health centers. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The alcohol samples were collected immediately after the first bottle-opening (day 0) and on day 3, 7, 14, 21 and 30 from 10 stations in hospital and community health centers in Pone-na-kaew district, Sakon Nakhon province, Thailand, during May-July 2011. Bactericidal efficacy of these samples against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae was evaluated. Ethanol concentration was quantified by a gas chromatography method. RESULTS: Bactericidal efficacy of the alcohol samples still remained on day 30 with ethanol concentration range of 60.91-65.99% v/v. CONCLUSION: This finding should be considered as a cost-benefit model for using alcohol solution in community hospital and health centers.
TI  - Antiadhesive polymer brush coating functionalized with antimicrobial and RGD peptides to reduce biofilm formation and enhance tissue integration.
AB  - This paper describes the synthesis and characterization of polymer-peptide conjugates to be used as infection-resistant coating for biomaterial implants and devices. Antiadhesive polymer brushes composed of block copolymer Pluronic F-127 (PF127) were functionalized with antimicrobial peptides (AMP), able to kill bacteria on contact, and arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptides to promote the adhesion and spreading of host tissue cells. The antiadhesive and antibacterial properties of the coating were investigated with three bacterial strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ability of the coating to support mammalian cell growth was determined using human fibroblast cells. Coatings composed of the appropriate ratio of the functional components: PF127, PF127 modified with AMP, and PF127 modified with RGD showed good antiadhesive and bactericidal properties without hampering tissue compatibility.
TI  - Comparison of the antimicrobial effect of heavy silicone oil and conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
AB  - PURPOSE: To conduct an in vitro experimental study comparing the effectiveness of conventional silicone oil and heavy silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of conventional silicone oil (RS OIL 5000) and heavy silicone oil (heavySil 1500) was tested. The antimicrobial effects of both silicone oils were determined by the growing capability of the microorganism. RESULTS: The number of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans decreased to zero levels at the second day of inoculation in heavy silicone oil. In conventional silicone oil, the microorganisms survived longer than in heavy silicone oil. CONCLUSION: Heavy silicone oil seems to be more effective than conventional silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
TI  - Incisional surgical site infection after elective open surgery for colorectal cancer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to clarify the incidence and risk factors for incisional surgical site infections (SSI) in patients undergoing elective open surgery for colorectal cancer. METHODS: We conducted prospective surveillance of incisional SSI after elective colorectal resections performed by a single surgeon for a 1-year period. Variables associated with infection, as identified in the literature, were collected and statistically analyzed for their association with incisional SSI development. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were identified for evaluation. The mean patient age was 67 years, and 120 (55%) were male. Thirty-three (14.7%) patients were diagnosed with incisional SSI. Multivariate analysis suggested that incisional SSI was independently associated with TNM stages III and IV (odds ratio [OR], 2.4) and intraoperative hypotension (OR, 3.4). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of incisional SSI in our cohort was well within values generally reported in the literature. Our data suggest the importance of the maintenance of intraoperative normotension to reduce the development of incisional SSI.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides as potential tool to fight bacterial biofilm.
AB  - Recently, the topic of biofilm has met a huge interest of researchers owing to a  significant role played by this microbial life form in severe infections. These well organised three-dimensional microbial communities are characterized by a strong resistance to antimicrobials. Biofilms significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality as related infections are very difficult to treat due to their tendency to relapse after the withdrawal of antibiotics. According to the literature, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a high potential as future antibiofilm agents. AMPs can influence various stages of biofilm formation and exhibit antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms including multi-drug resistant strains. The purpose of the present study was to determine the activity of antimicrobial peptides against biofilms formed by a variety of bacterial strains. To do this, the following antimicrobial peptides were synthesized: Citropin 1.1, Lipopeptides Palm-KK-NH2 and Palm-RR-NH2, Omiganan, Pexiganan and Temporin A. Antimicrobial activity of the compounds and conventional antibiotics was determined for planktonic cells and biofilms formed by reference strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. AMPs exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains, while Gram-negative bacteria were less susceptible. Antimicrobial activity of the tested peptides against biofilms formed by Gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger as compared to that of conventional antimicrobials.
TI  - Sarconesiopsis magellanica (Diptera: Calliphoridae) excretions and secretions have potent antibacterial activity.
AB  - The most important mechanism for combating infection using larval therapy depends on larval excretions and secretions (ES). The present work was aimed at evaluating Sarconesiopsis magellanica (Diptera: Calliphoridae) ES antibacterial activity in six bacterial strains (three Gram-positive and three Gram-negative) and comparing this to the effect of Lucilia sericata-derived ES. Antibacterial activity at 50mug/mL minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-12228 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-29213 strains, when the turbidimetry test involving S. magellanica ES was used; the rest of the bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-10145, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-9027 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-27853) were inhibited at a 100mug/mL MIC. Twice the amount was required to inhibit the aforementioned bacteria with L. sericata-derived ES using this same technique; a similar trend was observed when the agar diffusion method was used instead. Furthermore, when the previously established MIC for each bacterial strain was used, their colonies became reduced following 1-6h incubation with S. magellanica derived ES, whilst the reduction occurred from 2 to 6hours with those from L. sericata. Although the MIC for each strain obtained with ciprofloxacin was lower than those established when using either blowfly derived-ES, the gradual reduction of the colonies occurred at a longer incubation time (6h or more). The results showed that S. magellanica ES antibacterial activity was more potent and effective, compared to that of L. sericata-derived ES.
TI  - Synthesis of new thiobarbituric acid derived spiroheterobicyclic compounds and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series pf novel (7S, 11R)-substituted diphenyl-2,4,8,10-tetraazaspiro [5.5] undecane-3-thio-1,5,9-triones 4a-j and (7S,11R)-substituted diphenyl-2,4,8,10-tetraazaspiro[5.5] undecane-3-thio-1,5 dione, 9-thiones 5a-j were prepared using substituted aldehydes and urea/thiourea in the presence of thiobarbituric acid under solvent free, thermal and microwave conditions catalyzed by ecofriendly K-10 clay. The antibacterial potency of these compounds in vitro on the gram negative strains Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram positive strains Staphyllococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was evaluated.
TI  - Revamping the role of biofilm regulating operons in device-associated Staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Extensive use of indwelling devices in modern medicine has revoked higher incidence of device associated infections and most of these devices provide an ideal surface for microbial attachment to form strong biofilms. These obnoxious biofilms are responsible for persistent infections, longer hospitalization and high mortality rate. Gene regulations in bacteria play a significant role in survival, colonization and pathogenesis. Operons being a part of gene regulatory network favour cell colonization and biofilm formation in various pathogens. This review explains the functional role of various operons in biofilm expression and regulation observed in device-associated pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Poly (hexamethylene biguanide) adsorption on hydrogen peroxide treated Ti-Al-V alloys and effects on wettability, antimicrobial efficacy, and cytotoxicity.
AB  - An effective amount of the antiseptic agent PHMB cannot simply be placed on the surface of titanium alloys where hydrocarbons were removed by different purification procedures. Pre-treatment of Ti6Al4V specimen with 5% H2O2 in 24 h results in extra introduced -OH and -COOH groups as well as an adsorbed water film on the surface, which provide the base for the subsequent formation of a relatively stable and multi-layered PHMB film. The superficially adhering PHMB film produces no adverse effects on MG63 cells within a 48 h-cell culture, but promotes the initial attachment and spreading of the osteoblasts on the modified Ti6Al4V surface within 15 min. After direct bacterial inoculation of the active sample, the PHMB film reacts antimicrobially against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) after surface contact. The bactericidal efficacy is only slightly reduced after using of the same specimen for re-testing the antibacterial activity. MG63 cells adhere and proliferate within 48 h on a PHMB film-containing Ti6Al4V surface, which has been pre-contaminated with S. aureus. Bacterial biofilms were only revealed in controls without PHMB.
TI  - Biofilms on indwelling urologic devices: microbes and antimicrobial management prospect.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms (BFs) are a potential source of highly resistant infections, frequently formed on devicesand pose problems for management. AIM: This study was to develop rational approach for prevention of indwelling urologic device associated biofilm colonization. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: From randomly selected patients visiting Department of Urology of a tertiary hospital in India 150 uro catheters and 31 used ureteric stents, in-situ for > 30, were collected aseptically. The organisms were isolated and identified from washed devices dipped in broth. Evidence of bacteriuria in each case was checked by semi-quantitative method of urine culture, on day 0 and 14 of device use. The BF statuses of the device-adhered organisms were confirmed by modified method of Christensen. The antibiotic susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion method. Data were analyzed using the Graphpad Prism version 5 statistical software. RESULTS: Both single and multi-species BFs were formed on catheters, whereas mono-bacterial BFs were exclusive on stents. Predominant organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.67%,69/225,) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (15.11%, 34/225), Escherichia coli (13.78%, 31/225), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%, 27/225), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.44%, 19/225). Of all strains, (89.33%, 201/225) were found to be BF positive and their colonizations were early indicated by the presence of insignificant bacteriuria in follow-up urine samples. All BF isolates were resistant to at least three antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: BF colonization was almost inevitable in prolonged used urinary devices and the most frequent organisms were Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia spp. Their colonizations usually were indicated by insignificant bacteriuria from follow-up samples. Such BF dislodged organisms were multidrug resistant and could be a source of disseminated infection, yet were in-vitro preventable by many drugs.
TI  - Next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  - Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Substrate independent silver nanoparticle based antibacterial coatings.
AB  - Infections arising from bacterial adhesion and colonization on medical device surfaces are a significant healthcare problem. Silver based antibacterial coatings have attracted a great deal of attention as a potential solution. This paper reports on the development of a silver nanoparticles based antibacterial surface that can be applied to any type of material surface. The silver nanoparticles were surface engineered with a monolayer of 2-mercaptosuccinic acid, which facilitates the immobilization of the nanoparticles to the solid surface, and also reduces the rate of oxidation of the nanoparticles, extending the lifetime of the coatings. The coatings had excellent antibacterial efficacy against three clinically significant pathogenic bacteria i.e. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Studies with primary human fibroblast cells showed that the coatings had no cytotoxicity in vitro. Innate immune studies in cultures of primary macrophages demonstrated that the coatings do not significantly alter the level of expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines or the adhesion and viability of these cells. Collectively, these coatings have an optimal combination of properties that make them attractive for deposition on medical device surfaces such as wound dressings, catheters and implants.
TI  - Recombinant human lipocalin 2 acts as an antibacterial agent to prevent platelet  contamination.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet products is the major infectious  risk in blood transfusion medicine, which can result in life-threatening sepsis in recipient. Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) is an iron-sequestering protein in the antibacterial innate immune response, which inhibit bacterial growth. This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial property of Lcn2 in preventing bacterial contamination of platelets. METHODS: Recombinant Lcn2 was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and following purification and characterization of the recombinant Lcn2, its minimum inhibitory concentration was determined. Then, platelet concentrates were inoculated with various concentrations of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis, and the antibacterial effects of Lcn2 was evaluated at 20-24 degrees C. RESULTS: Results revealed that Lcn2 effectively inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(4) CFU/ml S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and E. faecalis at 40 ng/ml. At this concentration, Lcn2 also inhibited the growth of 1.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. CONCLUSION: Recombinant Lcn2 inhibited growth of a variety of platelet-contaminating bacteria. Therefore, supplementation of platelet concentrates with Lcn2 may reduce bacterial contamination.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - [Impact factors analysis of standardized perioperative antibiotic application on  nosocomial infection and drug-resistance bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact factors and clinical significance of standardized perioperative antibiotic application on nosocomial infection and drug-resistant bacteria strains in eye hospital. METHODS: It was a retrospective series case study. The inpatients underwent ophthalmologic operation of one year before standardized application (from Sep. 2009 to Aug. 2010) and one year after standardized application (from Sep. 2010 to Aug. 2011) in Tianjin Eye Hospital were selected and the incidence rate of nosocomial infection and types of drug-resistant strains in these two years were analyzed. RESULTS: From Sep. 2009 to Aug. 2010, the prophylactic antibiotics application rate for type I incisional surgeries was 80.29% (12937/16 111), the nosocomial infection rate was 0.011% (2/17 563). From Sep. 2010 to Aug. 2011, the same values were 44.50% (7968/17 905) and 0.005% (1/19 441). There was a significant decrease of prophylactic antibiotics application comparing these two years (chi(2) = 4587.78, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in nosocomial infection rate (chi(2) = 0.44, P > 0.05). Average antibiotics application rate for inpatient (type I-IV incisional surgeries) was 76.69% (13 469/17 563) from Sep. 2009 to Aug. 2010, and 49.40% (9604/19 441) from Sep. 2010 to Aug. 2011. There was a significant decrease over these two years (chi(2) = 2927.19, P < 0.05). The results of isolation and cultivation of bacteria in these two years showed that staphylococcus epidermidis predominated in gram-positive bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa predominated in gram-negative bacteria. Drug resistance rate of staphylococcus was 42.86% (33/77) from Sep. 2009 to Aug. 2010 and 39.19% (39/74) from Sep. 2010 to Aug. 2011. Drug resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2/11 from Sep. 2009 to Aug. 2010 and 2/13 from Sep. 2010 to Aug. 2011. There were no significant differences in drug resistance rate of staphylococcus and pseudomonas aeruginosa between these two years (chi(2) = 0.09, P > 0.05, chi(2) = 0.03, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: By standardizing the perioperative antibiotics application in eye hospital, the rate of systemic administration of antibiotics declined gradually. The Choices and the administrative mode of antibiotics were more rational than before. In the meanwhile, the rate of nosocomial infection and drug-resistance did not increase. Therefore, avoiding the drug abuse ensured the medical safety, which was worthy of further study.
TI  - [Investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food products].
AB  - Preservatives are added to food, drugs and other pharmaceutical products to avoid microbial contamination. For antimicrobial activity testing and preservative efficacy testing, vegetative forms of the standard test organisms are used. However, microbial biofilm formation may occur on living tissues, medical implants, industrial or drinking water pipes, natural aquatic systems, glass and plastic surfaces. In our study, it was aimed to determine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of some preservatives used in drug, cosmetics and food products and to compare the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) of microbial biofilm formed on glass surfaces which are commonly used in those areas and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the planktonic forms. In the study Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Salmonella Thyphimurium SL1344, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 11047, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as the standard strains; sodium nitrate, methylparaben, prophylparaben, potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate as the preservatives; ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, amphotericin B and itraconazole as the antimicrobial agents. MIC values were determined through the guidelines of CLSI M100-S18 and M27-A3 protocols. BioTimer method was used to determine the MBIC values. The value of "colony forming unit (CFU)/glass beads" was calculated using the graphics drawn by plotting the time of color change for phenol red or resazurin against log10CFU. All experiments were done with four media at different pH values namely pH: 7, pH: 6.5, pH: 6 and pH: 5.5. According to the results of tests on planktonic forms of the microorganisms, sodium benzoate was determined to be the most effective preservative against all the microorganisms tested except S.aureus and E.faecalis. The most effective preservative against S.aureus and E.faecalis was prophylparaben. Prophylparaben was also effective against S.epidermidis. However, in our study it was determined that preservatives were not effective against biofilm forms even if the inoculum was lower, equal to or higher than the inocula of the planktonic forms. The data obtained from this study indicated that preservatives used to prevent microbial contamination in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food products, are not effective against biofilm forms of the microorganisms. This study is thought to be a guide for further studies to be held in the investigation of antimicrobial and antibiofilm effects of preservatives used in drugs, cosmetics and food industry.
TI  - New hydrazines with sulphonamidic structure: synthesis,characterization and biological activity.
AB  - Infections caused by bacterial species are common in immunocompromised patients and carry significant treatment costs and mortality. The emerging resistance of microorganisms to some synthetic antimicrobial agents makes it necessary to continue the research for new antimicrobial drugs. AIM: To design new sulphonamide compounds with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New N-hydrazino acetyl-sulphonamides were prepared by condensation of some sulphonamides with chloroacetyl chloride and amination of intermediate compounds with hydrazine hydrate. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Klebsiellapneumoniae. Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using different methods: total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and DPPH radical scavenging activity. CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modulations performed on sulphonamide structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds, especially on their antioxidant effects.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of N-chlorotaurine against biofilm-forming bacteria grown on metal disks.
AB  - Many orthopedic surgeons consider surgical irrigation and debridement with prosthesis retention as a treatment option for postoperative infections. Usually, saline solution with no added antimicrobial agent is used for irrigation. We investigated the activity of N-chlorotaurine (NCT) against various biofilm-forming bacteria in vitro and thereby gained significant information on its usability as a soluble and well-tolerated active chlorine compound in orthopedic surgery. Biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus were grown on metal alloy disks and in polystyrene dishes for 48 h. Subsequently, they were incubated for 15 min to 7 h in buffered solutions containing therapeutically applicable concentrations of NCT (1%, 0.5%, and 0.1%; 5.5 to 55 mM) at 37 degrees C. NCT inactivated the biofilm in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Scanning electron microscopy revealed disturbance of the biofilm architecture by rupture of the extracellular matrix. Assays with reduction of carboxanilide (XTT) showed inhibition of the metabolism of the bacteria in biofilms. Quantitative cultures confirmed killing of S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on metal alloy disks by NCT. Clinical isolates were slightly more resistant than ATCC type strains, but counts of CFU were reduced at least 10-fold by 1% NCT within 15 min in all cases. NCT showed microbicidal activity against various bacterial strains in biofilms. Whether this can be transferred to the clinical situation should be the aim of future studies.
TI  - gamma-Alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5H)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae Delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. We have recently reported that some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of Enterococcus faecalis. In the present Letter we describe results of the biological evaluation of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus mutans. Our results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. In some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/mL (1.3 muM, compound 3d) and 0.7 mug/mL (1.3 muM, 3f). Results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.
TI  - Bacterial biofilm formation and treatment in soft tissue fillers.
AB  - Injection of soft tissue fillers plays an important role in facial reconstruction and esthetic treatments such as cosmetic surgery for lip augmentation and wrinkle smoothening. Adverse events are an increasing problem, and recently, it has been suggested that bacteria are the cause of a vast fraction these. We developed a novel mouse model and evaluated hyaluronic acid gel, calcium hydroxyl apatite microspheres, and polyacrylamide hydrogel for their potential for sustaining bacterial infections and their possible treatments. We were able to culture Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Probionibacterium acnes in all three gels. When contaminated gels were left for 7 days in a mouse model, we found sustainment of bacterial infection with the permanent gel, less with the semi-permanent gel, and no growth within the temporary gel. Evaluation of treatment strategies showed that once the bacteria had settled (into biofilms) within the gels, even successive treatments with high concentrations of relevant antibiotics were not effective. Our data substantiate bacteria as a cause of adverse reactions reported when using tissue fillers, and the sustainability of these infections appears to depend on longevity of the gel. Most importantly, the infections are resistant to antibiotics once established but can be prevented using prophylactic antibiotics.
TI  - The antibiofilm effect of blueberry fruit cultivars against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The antibiofilm and antibacterial properties against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis and chemical characterization of six hydroethanolic blueberry extracts (blueberry rabbiteye-Vaccinium virgatum) from different cultivars and means of propagation were investigated. The total flavonoid, anthocyanin, and phenolic contents were determined by specific and well-established methods. Among the cultivars, Briteblue showed the lowest content of all metabolites analyzed, while Bluegem showed the highest concentrations of these compounds. All the micropropagated cultivars presented the highest amounts of chlorogenic acid. The blueberry fruit extracts showed strong activity against S. epidermidis biofilm (up to 84% inhibition) without inhibiting bacterial growth. Likewise, Bluegem micropropagated extract, which had the highest anthocyanin, flavonoids, and phenolic compound content, demonstrated the highest S. epidermidis biofilm inhibitory effect. Finally, a linear correlation between the total phenolic content and the percentage of biofilm inhibition was observed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluorescent Ag nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of fluorescent Ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm (nAg-Fs) is  demonstrated and compared with the other Ag nanoparticles of different shapes and size. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis NCIM2493 and Bacillus megaterium) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 and Escherichia coli) and fungal strains (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). Insights into the possible mechanism were investigated using fluorescence microscope and cytoplasmic materials release assay. The fluorescence microscopic measurements show that the nAg-Fs are localized at the centre of the cell, and 50% decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed upon 2-h incubation. Maximum cytoplasmic release was observed with spherical Ag nanoparticles of 10 nm. Although the nAg-F shows minimum cytoplasmic release, it has the highest activity. The microbial killing effect of nAg-Fs is actually originates from its intracellular activity. The antimicrobial activity of nAg-Fs is significantly higher than the other synthesized nanoparticles of different shapes and size. The activity of the nanoparticles has been rationalized by considering the shape, size and surface structure of the particles. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study aims to demonstrate the size and shape-dependent antimicrobial activity of Ag nanoparticles. It is shown for the first time that the fluorescent Ag nanoparticles of 1.5 nm have superior antimicrobial activity with respect to the larger particles. The shape and size of the particles actually control their activity. The smaller particles can easily penetrate the cell wall and have pronounced activity. These findings may be useful in the development of potential antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Significance and prevention of post-operative wound complications].
AB  - Although surgical site infections (SSI) in dermatologic operative procedures are  extremely rare, it is important to understand risks and etiological factors to initiate risk assessment and specific preventive measures. SSI commonly are associated with a complicated, long-term and expensive outcome. Typical wound pathogens of these infections include a variety of multiresistant organisms along with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, hemolytic streptococci and the gram-negative bacilli Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Effective hygienic measures as part of an adequate quality management system should consider the critical points in the development of SSI, particularly in the setting of an outpatient dermatologic unit, such as preparation of the operative area, preoperative skin antisepsis, hand hygiene, safe and skilled technique by surgeons, and barrier nursing to prevent spread of pathogens. The baseline infection incidence in dermatologic surgery inherently is low; nevertheless significant improvements can be achieved by implementation of risk-adapted infection control measures.
TI  - Universal intravenous access cleaning device fails to sterilize stopcocks.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contamination of a central venous catheter may occur through use of conventional open-lumen stopcock devices (COLDs), or disinfectable, needleless, closed connectors (DNCCs). We investigated the effectiveness of a new universal IV access cleaning device (Site-Scrub) compared with 70% isopropyl alcohol prep pads for sanitizing COLDs or DNCCs inoculated with common catheter-associated pathogens. METHODS: Site-Scrub was compared with 70% alcohol prep pads for sanitizing contaminated female Luer lock COLD or DNCC filled with sterile saline or propofol and 2 common bacterial central venous catheter contaminants (Staphylococcus epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Devices were contaminated using a glove touch (COLD and DNCC) or syringe tip (COLD). The primary end point of the study was colony-forming units (CFU) after 24 hours. RESULTS: The use of glove touch contamination, the contaminants, S epidermidis and P aeruginosa, produced CFU in saline-filled COLDs treated with the Site-Scrub, but not in those treated with alcohol pads (P < 0.001). Similar results were observed with propofol-filled COLDs (P < 0.001). For DNCCs filled with saline or propofol, both alcohol and Site-Scrub effectively reduced CFU growth compared with contaminated controls (P < 0.001). When COLDs were contaminated by treated syringe tips, there was no significant evidence of reduction in CFU growth by using either alcohol pads or Site-Scrub compared with contaminated controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that when the inner surface of the COLD is contaminated, both alcohol pads and Site-Scrub were not significantly effective in decontaminating the COLD. When the COLD rim is contaminated, however, alcohol pads outperform Site-Scrub. DNCCs were uniformly decontaminated with either treatment. Future work should focus on better access systems because current COLDs are difficult to decontaminate.
TI  - Antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of DispersinB(R)-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  - The medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. As the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of DispersinB((R)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum KSL-W antimicrobial peptide. The combination of DispersinB((R)) and KSL-W peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, the wound gel formulation comprising DispersinB((R)), KSL-W peptide, and a gelling agent Pluronic F-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel Silver-Sept, DispersinB((R))-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded MRSA, S. epidermidis, CoNS, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial DispersinB((R))-KSL-W wound gel in chronic wound management.
TI  - [Evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (SNP's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for therapeutic purposes. It is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal SNP's possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of SNP's against cariogenic bacteria: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus mitis responsible for initiation of dental carries. Tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. Nanotechnology creates a new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. METHODS: Colloidal silver solution (CSS) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. Nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: S. mutans, S. salivarius, S. sanguinis and S, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs of 7 patients treated for dental carries at Department of Conservative Dentistry, Medical University of Warsaw. MIC and MBC values for CSS's were evaluated. RESULTS: CSS used in this research is of good stability. No agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. Silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. MIC values were: 12-25 ppm for S. salivarius, 25 ppm for S. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for S. mitis and 50 ppm for S. mutans, while MBC values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. After 24 hours of contact MBC values were: 25-50 ppm for S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for S. mitis and 200 ppmfor S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: Antimicrobial properties of CSS depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. The susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. Sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.
TI  - Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography  in the diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis: a case series.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is challenging. The gold standard for prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis is trans-esophageal echocardiography. However, trans-esophageal echocardiography may result in negative findings or yield images difficult to differentiate from thrombus in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. Combined computed tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is a potentially promising diagnostic tool for several infectious conditions and it has also been employed in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis but data are still scant. CASE PRESENTATIONS: We reviewed the charts of 6 patients with prosthetic aortic valves evaluated for suspicion of prosthetic valve endocarditis, at two different hospital, over a 3-year period. We found 3 patients with early-onset PVE cases and blood cultures yielding Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, respectively; and 3 late-onset cases in the remaining 3 patients with isolation in the blood of Streptococcus bovis, Candida albicans and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Initial trans-esophageal echocardiography was negative in all the patients, while fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed images suspicious for prosthetic valve endocarditis. In 4 out of 6 patients valve replacement was done with histology confirming the prosthetic valve endocarditis diagnosis. After an adequate course of antibiotic therapy fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed resolution of prosthetic valve endocarditis in all the patients. CONCLUSION: Our experience confirms the potential role of fluoroseoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and follow-up of prosthetic valve endocarditis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Current pattern of antibiotic resistance of clinical isolates among conjunctival  swabs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the etiological agent in bacterial conjunctivitis and to  determine the antibiogram of bacterial isolates. METHODOLOGY: This observational study was conducted at Dr. Essa's Laboratory over a period of 12 months ending in March 2012. Two hundred samples taken from conjunctiva of patients with conjunctivitis were cultured on routine medium and the antibiograms of bacterial isolates were determined by Kirby- Bauer disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The analysis of the culture showed that 41% were cultured positive with gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 52.5% and Staphylococcus epidermidis 30.1% and Micrococci 8.3%. However, 9.1% were gram negatives with Klebsiella pneumoniae 5.14% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2.6% and 1.36% were others (Acinetobacter, Haemophilus , E.coli and Moraxella) keeping in view the increasing use of contact lens and unclean fingers. The overall antibiograms of bacterial isolates indicate aminoglycosides (gentamicin, tobramicin) and the newer quinolones as apparent drug of choice for empirical therapy, followed by chloramphenicol, since drug fussy gram-negatives such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and E.coli were among the conjunctival isolates. Resistance profile of gram positive isolates shows cefixime 91.4%, doxycycline 57.9%, cotrimoxazole 29.3%, ampicillin 22.9%, ciprofloxacin 13.4%, cephradine 8.3%, cefuroxime 7.1%, fosfomycin 4.7%, ceftriaxone 3.6%, co-amoxiclav 3.6%, cefotaxime 3.5%, vancomycin 2.6%. CONCLUSION: Resistance to all conventionally used antibiotics is increasing, therefore identification of etiological agent and antibiogram is important to treat conjunctivitis and to avoid complications.
TI  - Scleral buckle infections: microbiological spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological  spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility in patients with scleral buckle infection. Medical records of all the patients diagnosed as buckle infection at L. V. Prasad Eye Institute between July 1992 and June 2012 were reviewed in this non-comparative, consecutive, retrospective case series. FINDINGS: A total of 132 eyes of 132 patients underwent buckle explantation for buckle infection during the study period. The incidence of buckle infection at our institute during the study period was 0.2% (31 out of 15,022). A total of 124 isolates were identified from 102 positive cultures. The most common etiological agent isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27/124, 21.77%) followed by Mycobacterium sp. (20/124, 16.13%) and Corynebacterium sp. (13/124, 10.48%). The most common gram negative bacilli identified was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9/124, 7.26%). The median interval between scleral buckling surgery and onset of symptoms of local infection was 30 days. All eyes underwent buckle explantation and median time interval between primary SB surgery and explantation was 13 months. Recurrent retinal detachment was observed in two cases at 7 and 48 months, respectively, after buckle explantation. Gram positive, gram negative, and acid-fast organisms isolated from 2003 to 2012 were most commonly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (100%), and amikacin (89%). Susceptibility to ciprofloxacin during the same time period was observed in 75% (15/20), 100% (13/13), and 87% (7/8) of gram positive, gram negative, and acid-fast isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: Scleral buckle infection is relatively rare and has a delayed clinical presentation. It is most commonly caused by gram positive cocci. Based on the current antimicrobial susceptibility, ciprofloxacin can be used as empirical therapy in the management of scleral buckle infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial surfaces using covalently bound polyallylamine.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of the cationic polymer polyallylamine (PA) when covalently bonded to glass. The objective was to obtain a robust attachment, yet still allow extension of the polymer chain into solution to enable interaction with the bacteria. The PA film displayed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis , Staphylococcus aureus , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Glass surfaces were prepared by a straightforward two-step procedure of first functionalizing with epoxide groups using 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxy silane (GOPTS) and then exposing to PA so that the PA could bind via reaction of a fraction of its amine groups. The surfaces were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to verify the presence of the polymer on the surface, zeta potential measurements to estimate the surface charge of the films, and atomic force microscopy to determine the extension of the polymer chains into solution. Antimicrobial properties of these coatings were evaluated by spraying aqueous suspensions of bacteria on the functionalized glass slides, incubating them under agar, and counting the number of surviving cell colonies.
TI  - Bioactive glass BAG-S53P4 for the adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones: an in vitro and prospective clinical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the in vitro antibacterial activity of the bioglass BAG S53P4 against multi-resistant microorganisms commonly involved in osteomyelitis and to evaluate its use in surgical adjunctive treatment of osteomyelitis. METHODS: In vitro antibacterial activity of BAG-S53P4 against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates was evaluated by means of time kill curves, with colony counts performed after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. In vivo evaluation was performed by prospectively studying a cohort of 27 patients with a clinically and radiologically diagnosed osteomyelitis of the long bones in an observational study. Endpoints were the absence of infection recurrence/persistence at follow-up, no need for further surgery whenever during follow-up and absence of local or systemic side effects connected with the BAG use. RESULTS: In vitro tests regarding the antibacterial activity of BAG S53P4 showed a marked bactericidal activity after 24 hrs against all the tested species. This activity continued in the subsequent 24 hrs and no growth was observed for all strains after 72 hrs. Results of the clinical study evidenced no signs of infection in 24 patients (88.9%) at the follow-up, while 2 subjects showed infection recurrence at 6 months from index operation and one more needed further surgical procedures. BAG-S53P4 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro and in vivo findings reinforce previous observations on the efficacy of BAG-S53P4 for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones, also in the presence of multi-resistant strains and in immunocompromised hosts, without relevant side effects and without the need for locally adding antibiotics. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Deutschen Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS) unique identifier: DRKS00005332.
TI  - Composition and antibacterial activity of heracleum transcaucasicum and heracleum anisactis aerial parts essential oil.
AB  - PURPOSE: Two plant essential oils (EOs), including those from Heracleum transcaucasicum and Heracleum anisactiss (Umbeliferae) were studied to detect the chemical constituents and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: The EOs of H. transcaucasicum and H.anisactis (Apiacae) were obtained by hydrodistillation from aerial parts of the plants. The chemical analyses of the EOs were performed by GC/Mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Myristicin was found to be the principal constituent in both EOs. The susceptibility tests of EOs were performed by agar disc diffusion technique against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. RESULTS: Eight components comprising 99.97% of the total essential oil of H. transcaucasicum and a total of three compounds accounting for 98.5% of the total oil composition of aerial parts of H. anisactis were identified, of which myristicin was the main compound in both EOs. The EOs of H. transcaucasicum and H. anisactis showed weak antibacterial property against Gram-positive strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis with no measurable effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our GC-MS study revealed myristicin to be the major constituent of H. transcaucasicum and H.anisactis aerial parts. In spite of all the information available on the antibacterial properties of plants essential oils, we were not able to find significant antibacterial activity for both EOs.
TI  - The antimicrobial assessment of some Nigerian herbal soap.
AB  - Twenty samples of herbal soaps were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against bacteria and yeast of significance in skin infections with the aim to provide some justification for the continued use of the soaps in the management of superficial skin infections. All the soaps were found to possess antimicrobial activity in a concentration and organism dependent manner. The soaps were more active against the gram positive organisms than the Gram negative organisms while none of the soaps had activity against the tested yeasts. Only 35% of the soaps were appropriately packaged with adequate directions for use and storage. The study showed that the tested soaps possessed antimicrobial properties and they can contribute to the treatment and management of skin infections caused by bacteria if well prepared with the appropriate plant materials to target specific causative organisms and packaged with appropriate directions for use and storage.
TI  - Anti-biofilm efficacy of low temperature processed AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coating.
AB  - Biofilms are a major concern in the medical settings and food industries due to their high tolerance to antibiotics, biocides and mechanical stress. Currently, the development of novel methods to control biofilm formation is being actively pursued. In the present study, sol-gel coatings of AgCl-TiO2 nanoparticles are presented as potential anti-biofilm agents, wherein TiO2 acts as a good supporting matrix to prevent aggregation of silver and facilitates its controlled release. Low-temperature processed AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coatings inhibit biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro biofilm assay experiments demonstrated that AgCl-TiO2 nanocomposite coated surfaces, inhibited the development of biofilms over a period of 10days as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. The silver release kinetics exhibited an initial high release, followed by a slow and sustained release. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the coatings could be attributed to the release of silver, which prevents the initial bacterial adhesion required for biofilm formation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Mediterranean Oyster mushrooms, species of genus Pleurotus (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Extracts of the Mediterranean culinary-medicinal Oyster mushrooms Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii, P. eryngii var. ferulae, P. eryngii var. elaeoselini, and P. nebrodensis were tested for their in vitro growth inhibitory activity against a group of bacterial reference strains of medical relevance: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis RP62A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, and Escherichia coli ATCC10536. All of the Pleurotus species analyzed inhibited the tested microorganisms in varying degrees. The data included in this paper for P. nebrodensis and P. eryngii var. elaeoselinii are new reports.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of gemini quaternary ammonium salts.
AB  - A series of gemini quaternary ammonium salts (chlorides and bromides), with various hydrocarbon chain and spacer lengths, were tested. These compounds exhibited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and were not mutagenic. The strongest antibacterial effect was observed for TMPG-10 Cl (against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and TMPG-12 Br (against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 and clinical ESBL(+) isolate 434) surfactants. These compounds inhibited the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 35984 to a polystyrene surface and eradicated biofilm formed by P. aeruginosa PAO1. The activity of studied compounds was dependent on hydrocarbon chain length.
TI  - Antimicrobial polycarbonates: investigating the impact of balancing charge and hydrophobicity using a same-centered polymer approach.
AB  - Biodegradable antimicrobial polymers are a promising solution for combating drug  resistant microbes. When designing these materials, the balance between charge and hydrophobicity significantly affects the antimicrobial activity and selectivity toward microbes over mammalian cells. Furthermore, where the charge and hydrophobicity is located on the molecules has also proven to be significant. A series of antimicrobial homopolymer polycarbonates were synthesized, where the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance was controlled by varying the spacer between the charged quaternary ammonium moiety and the polymer backbone (a "same-centered" structure where the hydrophobic moiety is directly attached to the charged moiety). These homopolymers were active against all microbes tested but depending on the spacer length some hemolytic activity was observed. To reduce the polymer hemolytic activity we systematically varied the polymer composition by copolymerizing the different monomers used in the "same center" homopolymers. By maintaining charge on each repeat unit but copolymerizing monomers having varied hydrophobic side chain lengths, polymers with high activity and selectivity were achieved. In addition, these macromolecules act via a membrane disruption mechanism, making them less likely to induce resistance.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, and antimicrobial activity of silver(I) and copper(II) complexes of phosphate derivatives of pyridine and benzimidazole.
AB  - Two silver(I) complexes--[Ag(4-pmOpe)]NO(3)}(n) and [Ag(2-bimOpe)(2)]NO(3)--and three copper(II) complexes--[Cu(4)Cl(6)O(2-bimOpe)(4)], [CuCl(2)(4-pmOpe)(2)], and [CuCl(2)(2-bis(pm)Ope]--were synthesized by reaction of silver(I) nitrate or copper(II) chloride with phosphate derivatives of pyridine and benzimidazole, namely diethyl (pyridin-4-ylmethyl)phosphate (4-pmOpe), 1H-benzimidazol-2-ylmethyl diethyl phosphate (2-bimOpe), and ethyl bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)phosphate (2-bis(pm)Ope). These compounds were characterized by (1)H, (1)(3)C, and (3)(1)P NMR as well as IR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and ESIMS spectrometry. Additionally, molecular and crystal structures of {[Ag(4-pmOpe)]NO(3)}n and [Cu(4)Cl(6)O(2-bimOpe)(4)] were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The antimicrobial profiles of synthesized complexes and free ligands against test organisms from the ATCC and clinical sources were determined. Silver(I) complexes showed good antimicrobial activities against Candida albicans strains (MIC values of approximately 19 muM). [Ag(2-bimOpe)(2)]NO(3) was particularly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, with MIC values of approximately 5 and approximately 10 muM, respectively. Neither copper(II) complexes nor the free ligands inhibited the growth of test organisms at concentrations below 500 mug mL(-)(1).
TI  - Antibacterial screening of traditional herbal plants and standard antibiotics against some human bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Chloroformic and isoamyl alcohol extracts of Cinnnamomum zylanicum, Cuminum cyminum, Curcuma long Linn, Trachyspermum ammi and selected standard antibiotics were investigated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against six human bacterial pathogens. The antibacterial activity was evaluated and based on the zone of inhibition using agar disc diffusion method. The tested bacterial strains were Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aurues, Serratia marcesnces, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ciprofloxacin showed highly significant action against K. pneumonia and S. epidermidis while Ampicillin and Amoxicillin indicated lowest antibacterial activity against tested pathogens. Among the plants chloroform and isoamyl alcohol extracts of C. cyminum, S. aromaticum and C. long Linn had significant effect against P. aeruginosa, S. marcesnces and S. pyogenes. Comparison of antibacterial activity of medicinal herbs and standard antibiotics was also recorded via activity index. Used medicinal plants have various phytochemicals which reasonably justify their use as antibacterial agent.
TI  - Evaluation of the physical and antimicrobial properties of silver doped hydroxyapatite depending on the preparation method.
AB  - In the present study, the effect of the preparation method on the physical and antibacterial properties of silver doped hydroxyapatite (HAp/Ag) samples was investigated. HAp/Ag with 0.1-5 % of silver was prepared using two different modified wet chemical precipitation methods. A comparison of thermal stability and thermodynamical properties indicated that the thermal stability and sintering temperature of HAp/Ag were higher than those of pure hydroxyapatite if Ca(NO3)2.4H2O, AgNO3, NH4OH and (NH4)2HPO4 were used as raw materials. Phase composition and silver release were determined by XRD and ICP-MS. The study showed that, after 50 h in simulated body fluid 0.8-1.8 % of silver of the total silver amount was released from compact HAp/Ag scaffolds, and release kinetics strongly depended on the HAp/Ag preparation method. In vitro antibacterial activity of samples from each method against the bacterial strains Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was approved. Results showed that, in the case of using Ca(OH)2, H3PO4 and AgNO3 as raw materials for HAp/Ag synthesis, higher antibacterial activity towards both bacterial strains could be obtained.
TI  - Development of a poly(ether urethane) system for the controlled release of two novel anti-biofilm agents based on gallium or zinc and its efficacy to prevent bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - Traditional antibiotic therapy to control medical device-based infections typically fails to clear biofilm infections and may even promote the evolution of antibiotic resistant species. We report here the development of two novel antibiofilm agents; gallium (Ga) or zinc (Zn) complexed with protoporphyrin IX (PP) or mesoprotoporphyrin IX (MP) that are both highly effective in negating suspended bacterial growth and biofilm formation. These chelated gallium or zinc complexes act as iron siderophore analogs, supplanting the natural iron uptake of most bacteria. Poly (ether urethane) (PEU; Biospan(R)) polymer films were fabricated for the controlled sustained release of the Ga- or Zn-complexes, using an incorporated pore-forming agent, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). An optimum formulation containing 8% PEG (MW=1450) in the PEU polymer effectively sustained drug release for at least 3months. All drug-loaded PEU films exhibited in vitro >/= 90% reduction of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria in both suspended and biofilm culture versus the negative control PEU films releasing nothing. Cytotoxicity and endotoxin evaluation demonstrated no adverse responses to the Ga- or Zn-complex releasing PEU films. Finally, in vivo studies further substantiate the anti-biofilm efficacy of the PEU films releasing Ga- or Zn- complexes.
TI  - Evaluation of the anti-infectious properties of polyester vascular prostheses functionalised with cyclodextrin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Synthetic vascular graft infection (SVGI) remains associated with high morbidity-mortality rates. Newly developed polyester vascular prostheses (PVP) functionalised with cyclodextrin (PVP-CD) allowed sustained-drug-eluting of several antibiotics. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PVP-CD loaded with antibiotics against bacteria that are commonly responsible for SVGI in current practice. METHODS: Samples of PVP-CD loaded with antibiotics and uncoated-PVP were tested in-vitro for their ability to limit bacterial adhesion and prevent bacterial proliferation over time. Their anti-infectious properties were further evaluated in-vivo in a mouse model of SVGI. Both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSA) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, En. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria were tested. RESULTS: PVP-CD loaded with rifampin showed significant bacterial adhesion reduction and growth inhibition against Gram-positive bacteria. Similar results were obtained against Gram-negative bacteria with PVP-CD loaded with ciprofloxacin. In the mouse model, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial proliferations were significantly prevented by PVP-CD loaded with rifampin or with ciprofloxacin respectively. A decrease in macroscopic infections correlated with the bacterial proliferation rates depicted on the samples (Spearman's rho = 0.61; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the efficacy of PVP-CD loaded with appropriate antibiotics both in-vitro and in-vivo against six of the most common bacteria involved in human SVGI.
TI  - A distinguishable role of eDNA in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. Biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). The extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (eDNA). Here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. Next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. A Maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. Maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. Relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). Principal-component analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. The fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. An intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other EPSs, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact eDNA, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of EPS constituents. This implies that eDNA modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. IMPORTANCE: The protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. Mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. Maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. Here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other EPSs control a second, slower relaxation. Extracellular DNA, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other EPSs.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - The presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  - Mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (ET). It is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of VAP. Unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time VAP is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (SC). It is thus important to know whether these SC can predict the microbial flora in ET biofilms. In this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and of Candida albicans in cultures from ET biofilms and SC (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. Our data indicate that there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in ET biofilms and SC.
TI  - Superior sensitivity and decreased time to detection with the Bactec Peds Plus/F  system compared to the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood culture system.
AB  - Here, we compare the sensitivities and times to detection (TTD) of BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN (PF) and Bactec Peds Plus blood culture bottles. Test bottles were inoculated with 2 ml of banked whole blood, 1-ml aliquots of antibiotic suspension, and organisms diluted to simulate a bacteremia level of 10 to 100 CFU/ml. The control bottles were inoculated with 3 ml of banked blood and organism suspensions only. The organism-drug combinations were Staphylococcus epidermidis and vancomycin, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone, Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin, and cefotaxime, Escherichia coli, cefotaxime, and cefepime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime, and gentamicin, Neisseria meningitidis and ceftriaxone, and Haemophilus influenzae and ceftriaxone. The control and test bottle combinations were tested in duplicate. The bottles were incubated for 5 days; 32 control and 104 test bottles were incubated. Overall, the bacterial recovery rates for the PF and Peds Plus bottles were 37% and 62%, 94% and 100% in the controls, 19% and 50% in the test bottles, and 33% and 92% in the bottles with vancomycin, respectively. No bacteria were recovered from the bottles with S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, N. meningitidis, or H. influenzae in combination with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. The Peds Plus system detected P. aeruginosa in bottles with cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, but the PF system recovered bacteria only in bottles with trough levels of piperacillin-tazobactam. The mean TTD were shorter in the Peds Plus system controls (14.2 versus 18.0 h; P = 0.001) and the test bottles (14.3 versus 17.8 h; P = 0.008) than in the PF bottles. Overall, we demonstrated superior sensitivity, TTD, and antibiotic neutralization in the Bactec Peds Plus system compared to those in the Pediatric FAN system.
TI  - Emergence of Enterococcus species in the infectious microorganisms cultured from  patients with endophthalmitis in South Korea.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the microorganisms in culture-proven endophthalmitis and  their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents commonly used in South Korea. METHODS: Medical records of consecutive patients with culture-proven endophthalmitis at eight institutions between 1 January 2004 and 31 July 31 2010 were reviewed. Four categories of endophthalmitis were studied: postoperative, posttraumatic, endogenous, and unspecified. Outcome measures were culture-proven infectious organisms, antimicrobial susceptibilities, and final visual acuity in the patients. RESULTS: A total of 93 microorganisms were identified from 103 patients during the study period. The positive culture rate was 59.2 % (103/174). The most common organisms identified were Enterococcus faecalis (in 20.8 % of patients, 20/96), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18.8 %, 18/96), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (10.4 %, 10/96), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3 %, 6/96), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3 %, 6/96). Two cases of Enterococcus faecium (2.1 %) were recognized. Overall, 70 of 96 (73.0 %) isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, 22 (23.0 %) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 4 (4.2 %) were fungi. The most common organisms resulting in reduced light perception were E. faecalis and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of E. faecalis in endophthalmitis is mainly caused by the high incidence of E. faecalis in postoperative endophthalmitis. This increase also impacts the final visual acuity of the patients.
TI  - Spectrum of bacterial keratitis at a tertiary eye care centre in India.
AB  - AIM: To report the aetiological spectrum and susceptibility patterns of bacteria  isolated from patients with corneal ulceration. METHOD: The microbiological data of all patients with suspected infectious corneal ulceration who presented to the ocular microbiology service at this centre between 2005 and 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULT: Microorganisms were recovered from 1665 (77%) of the 2170 ulcers. Bacterial isolates accounted for 1205 of the organisms isolated. The most common bacterial pathogens isolated were various species of Staphylococcus, representing 777 (64.5%), followed by Staphylococcus spp. (148; 12.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (117; 9.7%). High percentages of Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin (>94%), followed by ofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Almost 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sixty-two (44%) of 140 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 79 (14.8%) of 534 isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 33 (14%) of 234 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were resistant to three or more antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus spp. were the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with keratitis in this setting. High percentages of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively. Interestingly, a high percentage of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to three or more antibiotics.
TI  - [Distribution and antibiotics resistance related to nosocomial pathogenic bacteria infection in patients after cardiac surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical distribution and antibiotics resistance of nosocomial infection caused pathogenic bacteria in patients after cardiac surgery. METHODS: Clinical data from 612 patients after cardiac surgery under microbiologically documented nosocomial infection was retrospectively analyzed from January 2007 to December 2012. Identification on related bacterial was performed in an automatic ATB Expression system while antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by Kirby-Bauer method. RESULTS: were analyzed by WHONET5.4. RESULTS: There were 697 strains of clinical pathogenic bacilli isolates identified and 421 (60.4%) of them were isolated from sputum while 185 (26.5%) were from blood. Acinetobacter spp. (124 strains, 17.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85 strains, 12.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (50 strains, 7.2%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacilli while S. epidermidis (75 strains, 10.8%) was the predominant Gram-positive cocci. The predominant eumycete was Candida albicans (43 strains, 6.2%). RESULTS: from the susceptibility test showed that carbapenems, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were the most active antibiotics. The detection of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) were 82.9% in S aureus and 95.9% in coagulase negative Staphylococcus. There was no Staphylococcus strains resistant to vancomycin found. CONCLUSION: Non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus appeared the important pathogens in patients after cardiac surgery. Drug resistance to antibiotics was quite common. Prevention on nosocomial infection and rational use of antibiotics remained very important in reducing the amount of drug resistant strains.
TI  - Antiadhesive activity of ulvan polysaccharides covalently immobilized onto titanium surface.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion leading to biofilm formation on the surface of implants is responsible for pathogenesis infections. One promising strategy to reduce the risk of infection consists of modifying implant surfaces by antibacterial coating. In the present study, the ability of ulvan, a non biocidal algal polysaccharide, to limit bacterial adhesion on titanium was investigated. To this end, titanium surfaces were modified by two different ulvans. Polysaccharides were covalently immobilized on titanium surfaces which had been previously functionalized by self assembled monolayers of aminoundecyltrimethoxysilane (AUTMS). Each step in the modification process was characterized by contact angle, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Bacterial adhesion assays showed that immobilized ulvans on titanium surface strongly decreased by about 90% the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, AFM observations showed that the polysaccharide also inhibited the bacterial spreading on the surface but not cell-to-cell interaction. The permanence of the anti-adhesive effect of the surfaces was finally tested on a non-motile organism, i.e., Staphylococcus epidermidis. The results showed that the effect was maintained for at least 24h.
TI  - Comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in Ganzi autonomous prefecture.
AB  - AIM: To compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of Tibetan, Yi and Han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. METHODS: The test subjects were selected from 2 Tibetan, 2 Yi and 3 Han populated places, respectively. Total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. Secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. After 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. RESULTS: There was no significant difference (P>0.05) of Gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among Tibetan, Yi and Han nationalities. The bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. The incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in Tibetan population was significantly lower than that of Han and Yi population. CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of Tibetan, Yi and Han people. All of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
TI  - Development and characterization of essential oil component-based polymer films:  a potential approach to reduce bacterial biofilm.
AB  - The development of new polymeric materials aimed to control the bacterial biofilm appears to be an important practical approach. The goal of the present study was to prepare and characterize poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) copolymer (EVA) films containing citronellol, eugenol, and linalool and evaluate their efficiency on growth and biofilm formation of Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in monospecies and dual species. The results showed that the addition of oil components influenced the elastic modulus (15 % decrease), the tensile stress (30 % decrease), the elongation at break (10 % increase), and the contact angle values (10-20 degrees decrease) while leaving the homogeneity of the surface unaltered. Among the polymeric films, EVA + citronellol and EVA + eugenol at 7 wt% had the best inhibitory effect. After 24-48 h of incubation, EVA + citronellol was more effective against the growth (30-60 % reduction) than EVA + eugenol (15-30 % inhibition). However, this inhibition decreased after 240 h of incubation. On the contrary, the biofilm evaluation revealed a strong inhibition trend also after prolonged incubation time: the amount of biomass per square centimeter formed on copolymer with oil components was significantly less (40-70 % decrease) than that on pure copolymer control for L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli. When polymeric materials were simultaneously inoculated with combinations of S. aureus and E. coli, the biomass accumulated was higher for EVA + citronellol and lower for EVA + eugenol than that in monoculture biofilm. The findings were similar to the results obtained by 2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide assay that measures the metabolic activity of viable cells.
TI  - [Multi-center clinical trial of FLAMIGEL (hydrogel dressing) for the treatment of residual burn wound].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of FLAMIGEL (hydrogel dressing) on the repair of residual burn wound. METHODS: Sixty burn patients with residual wounds hospitalized in 6 burn units from November 2011 to May 2012 were enrolled in the multi-center, randomized, and self-control clinical trial. Two residual wounds of each patient were divided into groups T (treated with FLAMIGEL) and C (treated with iodophor gauze) according to the random number table. On post treatment day (PTD) 7 and 14, wound healing rate was calculated, with the number of completely healed wound counted. The degree of pain patient felt during dressing change was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS). The mean numbers of wounds with score equal to zero, more than zero and less than or equal to 3, more than 3 and less than or equal to 6, more than 6 and less than or equal to 10 were recorded respectively. Wound secretion or exudate samples were collected for bacterial culture, and the side effect was observed. Data were processed with repeated measure analysis of variance, t test, chi-square test, and nonparametric rank sum test. RESULTS: Wound healing rate of groups T, C on PTD 7 was respectively (67 +/- 24)%, (45 +/- 25)%, and it was respectively (92 +/- 16)%, (72 +/- 23)% on PTD 14. There was statistically significant difference in wound healing rate on PTD 7, 14 between group T and group C (F = 32.388, P < 0.01). Ten wounds in group T and four wounds in group C were healed completely on PTD 7, with no significant difference between them (chi(2) = 0, P > 0.05). Forty-two wounds in group T and seven wounds in group C healed completely on PTD 14, with statistically significant difference between them (chi(2) = 42.254, P < 0.01). Patients in group T felt mild pain during dressing change for 37 wounds, with VAS score higher than zero and lower than or equal to 3. Evident pain was observed in patients of group C during dressing change for 43 wounds, and it scored higher than 3 and less than or equal to 6 by VAS evaluation. There was statistically significant difference in mean number of wounds with different grade of VAS score between group T and group C (Z = -4.638, P < 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, Baumanii, and Staphylococcus epidermidis were all detected in both groups, but there was no statistical difference between group T and group C (chi(2) = 0.051, P > 0.05). No side effect was observed in either of the two groups during the whole trial. CONCLUSIONS: FLAMIGEL can accelerate the healing of residual burn wounds and obviously relieve painful sensation during dressing change.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of caO nanoparticles.
AB  - The high degree of microbial diseases and their multidrug resistant properties make the researchers to develop new class of antimicrobial agents. A modern and innovative approach of drug development is the use of metallic nanoparticles as new formulations of antimicrobial agents. In this study, microwave irradiated CaO nanoparticles (CaO-NPs) were used to determine their antimicrobial efficacy against gram negative and gram positive bacteria, as well as pathogenic yeast. The physiochemical properties of CaO-NPs were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The nanoparticles consist of well dispersed agglomerates of grains with a narrow size distribution of 14-24 nm. The prepared CaO-NPs showed much higher antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MTCC 435) in comparision to Candida tropicalis (NCIM 3110). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of CaO-NPs was found within the range of 2-8 mM for all the above tested strains. This bioactive nanoparticle also inhibits the biofilm formation and may have future applications cheap and non toxic as antimicrobial drug for skin care product development.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - In Vitro Antimicrobial Long-Term Evaluation of Corneal Preservation Media Against Microorganisms Using A Closed-Chamber Study Model.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the existence of in vitro long-term antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS against microorganisms related to corneal infection using a closed-chamber study model. METHODS: Optisol-GS was contaminated with microorganisms related to corneal infections, and different times after contamination was analyzed using a closed-chamber study model. Microbial growths were analyzed by macroscopic observation. RESULTS: For Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days and 14 days after contamination occurred. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Candida albicans, microbial growth was observed in all samples studied. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 72 hours after contamination. For Streptococcus pyogenes, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 7 days after contamination. For Escherichia coli, bacterial growth was observed in samples taken 1 hour through 48 hours after contamination occurred. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that no in vitro antimicrobial effect for any microorganism analyzed was observed in contaminated Optisol-GS after 72 hours; however, effective antimicrobial activity was observed for S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, Str. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli after 7 to 10 days.
TI  - Demonic axe-like conjugated alkynes in combating microbes.
AB  - A new series of disubstituted alkynes was obtained by microwave induced internal  splitting of the corresponding beta-oxo-alkylidenetriphenylphosphoranes. The antimicrobial potential of these conjugated alkynes and phosphoranes was assayed in vitro against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and five fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Candida rugosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The 3-pyridylalkyne derivatives viz., 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6a), 3-(2-chloropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6b), ethyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6c), iso-propyl 3-(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)propiolate (6d) and 3-(2,6-dichloro-5-fluoropyridin-3-yl)propynenitrile (6e) were found to be highly potent towards all tested microorganisms except E. coli.
TI  - Three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of PCs. METHODS/MATERIALS: PCs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. Flow cytometry (FACS), BacT/Alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these PCs. RESULTS: At the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 CFU ml(-1), Q-PCR detected all five bacterial species tested. Screening with the BacT/Alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. Using FACS, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of 1 CFU ml(-1) on day 2. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 CFU ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. CONCLUSION: This study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of FACS in the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs was lower than that of either the BacT/Alert automated culturing method or Q-PCR.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacteria in urine samples by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis.
AB  - This study explored a method that can rapidly detect bacteria in urine samples for the auxiliary determination of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Urine samples from patients with UTIs (230 cases) were obtained using aseptic technique. The urine biochemical assay was then carried out using an automated urine analyzer for all the urine samples. Bacterial species were identified by a combination of bacterial culture technique, morphological observation and the BACT-IST microbial identification/susceptibility analysis system. The most common seven species of bacteria in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Bacterial samples were suspended in sample buffer solutions and separated by the "three-plug-injection" method using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Each species of bacteria appeared as a bacterial peak. The mixture of the seven species also provided only one peak. Further analysis showed that the concentration limit for the "three-plug-injection" method is 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL, and there is a good linear relationship between the peak height and bacterial concentration (R(2)=0.99). The effect of urine composition on CE results was also investigated. The results showed that urine composition, i.e., proteins, white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs), affected the peak retention time but could not affect the separation of bacteria. The results demonstrated that the bacteria in urine samples can be detected within 10min by the "three-plug-injection" method using CE. The "three-plug-injection" method is therefore suitable for the rapid detection of organisms in clinical urine samples from UTIs.
TI  - Prevention of pacemaker infections with perioperative antimicrobial treatment: an in vitro study.
AB  - AIMS: The antimicrobial treatment of pacemaker casings with antiseptics (povidone-iodine or octenidine dihydrochloride) or antibiotics (vancomycin, daptomycin, cefuroxime, Tazobac, or nebacetin) was analysed in vitro for its biocompatibility and efficacy in preventing the bacterial adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli to cardiac-implantable electrophysiological devices (CIEDs). METHODS AND RESULTS: Titan platelets (0.4 cm&sup2;) cut from pacemaker casings were impregnated with seven different antimicrobial solutions: two antiseptics and five antibiotics. Subsequently, they were challenged with bacterial contamination by four test strains over a 24 h incubation period. Bacterial adherence was quantified using the colony-forming-unit method after cell recovery with sonication and examined with confocal laser scanning electron microscopy. Simultaneously, the biocompatibility of the antimicrobial impregnation was assessed using pre-treated titan platelets in a culture of human fibroblasts, skeletal myoblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells. After a 48 h incubation, cell vitality was measured using the 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H/tetrazoliu m monosodium (WST-8) assay. The immersion of pacemaker casings in antiseptic or antibiotic solutions applies an antimicrobial coating that can significantly reduce bacterial adhesion. The studied impregnations differed in their antimicrobial efficacy and toxicity. CONCLUSION: Compared with the two antiseptics and the other tested antibiotics, nebacetin showed the best ratio of efficacy to toxicity. Nebacetin showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens without impairing human cell vitality. It is a safe and effective candidate for CIED impregnation.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion and growth reduction by novel rubber-derived oligomers.
AB  - In the medical field, attached bacteria can cause infections associated with catheters, incisions, burns, and medical implants especially in immunocompromised patients. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that attached bacteria are approximately 1000 times more resistant to antibiotics than planktonic cells. The rapid spread of antibiotic resistance in these and other organisms has led to a significant need to find new methods for preventing bacterial attachment. The goal of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of novel polymer coatings to prevent the attachment of three medically relevant bacteria. Tests were conducted with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus for oligomers derived from modifications of natural rubber (cis 1,4-polyisoprene). The different oligomers were: PP04, with no quaternary ammonium (QA); MV067, one QA; PP06, three QA groups. In almost all experiments, cell attachment was inhibited to various extents as long as the oligomers were used. PP06 was the most effective as it decreased the planktonic cell numbers by at least 50% for all bacteria. Differences between species sensitivity were also observed. P. aeruginosa was the most resistant bacteria tested, S. aureus, the most sensitive. Further experiments are required to understand the full extent and mode of the antimicrobial properties of these surfaces.
TI  - [Application of pyrosequencing in detection of common pathogens in sepsis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply pyrosequencing technique in the detection of the common pathogens in sepsis. METHODS: The primers for amplification and sequencing in pyrosequencing were designed according to alignment of the bacterial 16S rRNA sequence. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted for pyrosequencing, and the pathogen species were determined according to the sequencing data obtained. RESULTS: Pyrosequencing effectively yielded the sequencing data of the 28 bp sequences of the pathogens and clearly distinguished the pathogen species of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides, and Salmonella, but failed to distinguish Staphylococcus epidermidis from Staphylococcus aureus. CONCLUSION: Pyrosequencing technique can effectively distinguish the common pathogens in sepsis at the species level.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of two surface barrier discharges with air plasma against  in vitro biofilms.
AB  - The treatment of infected wounds is one possible therapeutic aspect of plasma medicine. Chronic wounds are often associated with microbial biofilms which limit the efficacy of antiseptics. The present study investigates two different surface barrier discharges with air plasma to compare their efficacy against microbial biofilms with chlorhexidine digluconate solution (CHX) as representative of an important antibiofilm antiseptic. Pseudomonas aeruginosa SG81 and Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A were cultivated on polycarbonate discs. The biofilms were treated for 30, 60, 150, 300 or 600 s with plasma or for 600 s with 0.1% CHX, respectively. After treatment, biofilms were dispensed by ultrasound and the antimicrobial effects were determined as difference in the number of the colony forming units by microbial culture. A high antimicrobial efficacy on biofilms of both plasma sources in comparison to CHX treatment was shown. The efficacy differs between the used strains and plasma sources. For illustration, the biofilms were examined under a scanning electron microscope before and after treatment. Additionally, cytotoxicity was determined by the MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay with L929 mouse fibroblast cell line. The cell toxicity of the used plasma limits its applicability on human tissue to maximally 150 s. The emitted UV irradiance was measured to estimate whether UV could limit the application on human tissue at the given parameters. It was found that the UV emission is negligibly low. In conclusion, the results support the assumption that air plasma could be an option for therapy of chronic wounds.
TI  - Riboflavin/UVA photochemical therapy for severe infectious keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the antibacterial activity of treatment with riboflavin and  ultraviolet A light (UVA) in cases of severe infectious keratitis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of an interventional case series in which 6 eyes of 6 patients with severe infectious keratitis, all of whom were refractive to multidrug conventional therapy, were treated with riboflavin/UVA. The procedure was conducted according to the standardized protocol of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) for keratoconus. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity and clinical outcomes were evaluated before and during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Five of the 6 patients showed rapid reduction in symptoms and decreased infiltrate size after riboflavin/UVA photochemical therapy. Signs of infection and inflammation mostly resolved within 1 to 2 weeks after the treatment. Despite this therapy, one patient continued to deteriorate, and penetrating keratoplasty was performed. CONCLUSIONS: The adjunctive use of riboflavin/UVA photochemical therapy has a positive effect on refractory infectious keratitis. The treatment seems to be safe and effective and should be considered as part of the first-line therapy in severe cases of infectious keratitis.
TI  - Comparative study of antibacterial and antifungal effects of rigid gas permeable  contact lens disinfecting solutions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare antimicrobial efficacy of rigid contact lens disinfecting solutions. We tested five commercially available solutions: Unique pH (Alcon Laboratories), Boston Advance (Polymer Technology Corp.), Nitilens Conditioner GP (Avizor), Total Care (AMO), Boston Simplus (Bausch&Lomb). Their efficacy to disinfect saline solution experimentally contaminated with American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Candida albicans (ATCC 90028) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (isolated from our laboratory) was tested. All tested solutions reduced concentrations of bacteria and fungi below 1000 CFU/mL (Colony forming unit; reduction by 3 log and 1 log, respectively) after the 8 hours period. Overall, all contact lens care solutions showed good disinfecting activity against tested bacteria and fungi, with more variation in their antifungal than in antibacterial efficacy. Results of our study might be valuable when selecting appropriate solutions for non-compliant contact lens wearers.
TI  - Antibacterial and anti-adhesion effects of the silver nanoparticles-loaded poly(L-lactide) fibrous membrane.
AB  - The complications of tendon injury are frequently compromised by peritendinous adhesions and tendon sheath infection. Physical barriers for anti-adhesion may increase the incidence of postoperative infection. This study was designed to evaluate the potential of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-loaded poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) electrospun fibrous membranes to prevent adhesion formation and infection. Results of an in vitro drug release study showed that a burst release was followed by sustained release from electrospun fibrous membranes with a high initial silver content. Fewer fibroblasts adhered to and proliferated on the AgNP-loaded PLLA electrospun fibrous membranes compared with pure PLLA electrospun fibrous membrane. In the antibacterial test, the AgNP-loaded PLLA electrospun fibrous membranes can prevent the adhesion of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AgNP-loaded PLLA electrospun fibrous membranes have the convenient practical medical potential of reduction of infection and adhesion formation after tendon injury.
TI  - An 8-year survey of strains identified in blood cultures in a clinical haematology unit.
AB  - The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria and fungi identified from blood cultures in the patients of the clinical haematology unit. A retrospective study was carried out over an 8-year period (2003-2010) in the clinical haematology unit of the Percy Military Medical Center. During this period, we collected 723 isolates: Gram-negative bacilli (70.8%) and Gram-positive cocci (18.7%). The four most commonly isolated species were Escherichia coli (18.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.8%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6.2%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%). The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 6.45% and that of coagulase-negative staphylococci 61.2%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. In E. coli, as in the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, a 27% resistance to fluoroquinolones was observed. Concerning P. aeruginosa, the phenotypes were distributed over penicillinase (23.4%) and cephalosporinase (13.1% were resistant to ceftazidime). The impermeability rate of imipenem was 9.3%. The aggressiveness and duration of haematological treatments explains why infections remain one of the main complications of neutropenia. The emergence of new or unusual bacteria is highly likely. Antibiotic selective pressure and long periods of hospitalization could explain the emergence of multiresistant bacteria. As a consequence, epidemiological surveillance is indispensable.
TI  - Systematic study of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides as novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
AB  - We describe the design and synthesis of a new series of non-natural short cationic lipopeptides (MW = 700) as antimicrobial agents. All of the synthesized lipopeptides were tested against a range of microbes such as Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, fungi including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). By systematic study of design template, we found that three ornithine residues conjugated with myristic acid are minimum requirement for a compound to be an antimicrobial agent. The most potent lipopeptide LP16 possesses broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and has MICs in the range of 1.5-6.25 mug/mL against Escherichia coli, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and MRSE. All lipopeptides showed high selectivity toward microbial strains as compared to human red blood cells (HC50 > 250 mug/mL). Moreover, most potent lipopeptides (LP16 and LP23) did not induce drug resistance in S. aureus even after 15 rounds of passaging. In addition, a representative lipopeptide (LP16) showed tryptic stability for 24 h. These results suggest the potential of short cationic lipopeptides to boost the discovery of future antimicrobial therapeutics.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant, antimicrobial properties and chemical composition of rose petals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rosa rugosa petals are used for production of teas, jams, wines and juices. Despite the wide availability of rose cultivars, comprehensive information on petal chemical composition and healthful properties is still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was analysis of cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of rugosa rose petals. RESULTS: Petals of R. rugosa were evaluated for their cytotoxic effect against cervical (HeLa) and breast cancer (T47D) cell lines and for antiradical activity (with DPPH*). As a result, significant cytotoxic (up to 100% of dead cells) and antiradical properties (IC(5)(0) 1.33-0.08 mg mg(-)(1) DPPH*) were demonstrated. Moreover, notable antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial (i.e. Staphylococcus. epidermidis, S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and two yeast strains (Candida. albicans, C. parapsilosis) was shown. Total phenolic, flavonoid, phenolic acid, tannin, carotenoid and polysaccharide content in petals was determined using spectrophotometric methods. Liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was used to thoroughly analyze phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides in the methanolic extract and fractions obtained after its separation. Five phenolic acids and six flavonoids previously not reported in the plant material were identified. CONCLUSION: This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of R. rugosa petals.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Risk factors and gene type for infections of MRSA in diabetic foot patients in Tianjin, China.
AB  - The objective was to study risk factors and gene type of DF patients infected with MRSA. A total of 429 DF patients were recruited. The patients with S aureus infections were divided into MRSA and MSSA groups. MRSA were genotyped by SCCmec. pvl and lukE-lukD were detected. A total of 559 pathogens were isolated from them, with G+ bacteria firstly(59.0%), followed G- bacilli (37.7%) and true fungi (3.3%). The 3 most frequently isolated pathogens were S aureus (35.2%), S epidermidis (12.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.2%). SCCmec III MRSA and SCCmec IVa MRSA had the same antibacterial spectrum. mecA positive rate was 100%. lukE-lukD and pvl positive rates were 100% and 0%, respectively. 28 strains belonged to SCCmec III and the others belonged to SCCmec IVa. The G+ cocci were the main pathogens, S aureus and S epidermidis were predominant among them. Antibiotic usage in 6 months prior to hospitalization, long course of ulcer, osteomyelitis and hypoproteinemia are risk factors for MRSA. SCCmec IVa is high in proportion to MRSA isolates, suggesting that CA-MRSA has become major pathogen of DF infection. All the MRSA were harboring lukE-lukD, which has been reported to present poor leucotoxin compared to pvl, and may be a response to atypical local inflammatory reaction in DF infection.
TI  - Biological evaluation of alginate-based hydrogels, with antimicrobial features by Ce(III) incorporation, as vehicles for a bone substitute.
AB  - A novel hydrogel, based on an alginate/hyaluronate mixture and Ce(III) ions, with effective bioactive and antimicrobial ability was developed to be used as vehicle of a synthetic bone substitute producing an injectable substitute (IBS). Firstly, three different IBSs were prepared using three developed alginate-based hydrogels, the hydrogel Alg composed by alginate, the hydrogel Alg/Ch composed by an alginate/chitosan mixture and the hydrogel Alg/HA composed by an alginate/hyaluronate mixture. MG63 cells viability on the IBSs was evaluated, being observed a significantly higher cell viability on the Alg/HA_IBS at all time points, which indicates a better cell adaptation to the material, increasing their predisposition to produce extracellular matrix and thus allowing a better bone regeneration. Moreover, SEM analysis showed evident filopodia and a spreader shape of MG63 cells when seeded on Alg/HA_IBS. This way, based upon the in vitro results, the hydrogel Alg/HA was chosen to the in vivo study by subcutaneous implantation in an animal model, promoting a slight irritating tissue response and visible tissue repairing. The next step was to grant antimicrobial properties to the hydrogel that showed the best biological behavior by incorporation of Ce(III) ions into the Alg/HA, producing the hydrogel Alg/HA2. The antimicrobial activity of these hyaluronate-based hydrogels was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Results showed that Ce(III) ions can significantly enhance the hydrogel antimicrobial ability without compromising the osteoconductivity improvement promoted by the vehicle association to the synthetic bone substitute.
TI  - Synthesis antimicrobial and antioxidant studies of new oximes of steroidal chalcones.
AB  - A convenient synthesis of oximes of steroidal chalcones (4a-4j) was performed and structural assignment of the products was confirmed on the basis of IR, (1)HNMR, (13)C NMR, MS and analytical data. The synthesized compounds were screened for in vitro antioxidant activity by using DPPH method and in vitro antimicrobial activity against different bacterial and fungal strains by agar diffusion method. The activity of the tested compounds against each microbe varied due to structural differences between them. Presence and position of different substituents on the benzene ring of the chalconyl pendent had a marked effect on the activity of the compounds. From the results it can be inferred that the compounds 4a-j showed significant antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity against all microbial strains used for testing.
TI  - Minimal inhibitory concentration of natural vinegar and of aluminium acetate-tartrate solution.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Vinegar and aluminium acetate preparations are used for treatment of  ear infections. It is instrumental to know the minimal inhibitory concentration to get effective remedies. This study was performed to assess the lowest dilution of vinegar (specified content, 6% acetic acid) and aluminium acetate-tartrate solution (specified content, 1.4% aluminium and 6% acetic acid) to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration against bacteria commonly found in chronic ear infections. BACKGROUND: Laboratory study on 2 samples of aluminium acetate-tartrate and on 1 sample of natural white wine vinegar on antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. METHODS: Performing of a susceptibility testing-determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) with the method of microbouillon dilution (DIN 58940 part 7). RESULTS: Acetic acid was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 0.1% to 0.2% against the tested bacteria; aluminium acetate-tartrate solution was found to be effective in vitro in concentrations of 1.25% to 2.5% against the tested bacteria. CONCLUSION: Vinegar respectively acetic acid diluted with water and aqueous aluminium acetate-tartrate solution could be effective ototopic preparations caused by one of the tested bacteria. For its effectiveness, an acid pH not higher than 4.5 is essential. Experiments with aluminium acetate-tartrate preparations on animals and clinical trials are required to obtain information about the response rates in ear infections and about any adverse effects.
TI  - Clinical experience with the surgicel family of absorbable hemostats (oxidized regenerated cellulose) in neurosurgical applications: a review.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxidized regenerated cellulose has a long history of safe and effective use in the surgical setting. Surgicel Original, Fibrillar and Nu-Knit absorbable hemostats are composed of oxidized regenerated cellulose and are sterile, absorbable knitted fabrics that are flexible and adhere readily to bleeding surfaces. The purpose of this paper is to discuss neurosurgical applications for these absorbable hemostatic agents. METHODS: The authors reviewed the literature and described their clinical experience with Surgicel hemostatic products. RESULTS: Neurosurgical applications of the hemostatic products include the management of diffuse capillary oozing following bipolar cautery in brain tumor resection beds and the control of epidural oozing during spinal surgery. As an adjunct to standard hemostatic procedures, these products facilitate rapid hemostasis and have bactericidal activity that extend to antibiotic-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumonia, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although generally safe and well-tolerated, these hemostatic agents should be removed when used around, in, or in proximity to, foramina in bone, areas of bony confine, the spinal cord, and/or the optic nerve or chiasm because it may otherwise swell and cause unwanted pressure. CONCLUSION: The physical, hemostatic, and bactericidal characteristics of this material makes it a useful adjunct for conventional hemostatic and controlling capillary, venous, and small arterial hemorrhage during neurosurgery. .
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Glyceryl trinitrate complements citrate and ethanol in a novel antimicrobial catheter lock solution to eradicate biofilm organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial catheter lock therapy is practiced to prevent lumenal-sourced infections of central venous catheters. Citrate has been used clinically as an anticoagulant in heparin-free catheter locks. Ethanol has also been widely studied as an antimicrobial lock solution component. This study reports on the synergy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) with citrate and ethanol in rapidly eradicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans biofilms in an in vitro model for catheter biofilm colonization. GTN has a long history of intravenous use as a hypotensive agent. It is potentially attractive as a component of a catheter lock solution because its physiologic half-life is quite short and its metabolic pathways are known. A lock containing 7% citrate and 20% ethanol required 0.01% GTN to fully eradicate biofilms of all test organisms within 2 h in the model. This GTN concentration is below the levels where clinically significant hypotensive effects are expected.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of cyclodextrin-antiseptics-complexes determined by microplate laser nephelometry and ATP bioluminescence assay.
AB  - Cyclodextrins (CDs) are able to form inclusion complexes with other molecules, thereby, protecting these guest molecules from degradation, enhancing their biocompatibility or influencing their physiological distribution while retaining their activity. Here, antibacterial effects of CD-complexes with the antiseptics chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX), iodine (IOD) and polihexanide (PHMB) were determined using two different in vitro methods, microplate laser nephelometry and an ATP bioluminescence assay. Laser nephelometry is a direct method for monitoring and evaluating growth of micro-organisms by measurement of the turbidity of the solution. In contrast, the ATP bioluminescence assay determines specifically the amount of metabolic active bacterial cells. The antibacterial effects of CD-antiseptics-complexes were examined for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and the results of both methods were compared in respect of calculated means of half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) and statistical evaluated Pearson's correlation coefficients (r). It could be demonstrated that both methods showed a high comparability although they differ in the parameters tested. This study revealed that CD-complexes with CHX and PHMB were most effective against E. coli and the tested staphylococci. While CD-IOD-complexes obtained high activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa was distinctly more resistant compared to the other bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Molecular identification of bacterial DNA in the chorioretinal scars of chronic granulomatous disease.
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder characterized by defects in phagocyte-derived nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. It is typically diagnosed in childhood and leads to severe, recurrent bacterial or fungal infections. Chorioretinal lesions are the most common ocular manifestation. We sought to determine whether there are infectious agents in CGD-associated chorioretinopathy. METHODS: Medical records and ocular histopathology from CGD cases from January 1983 to January 2012 at the National Institutes of Health were retrospectively reviewed. Chorioretinal cells from normal and lesional tissues of the same eye were microdissected. Primers for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia sp., and a panbacterial 16S ribosomal DNA were used for polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Seventeen CGD patients had ocular tissues (16 autopsied cases and 1 chorioretinal biopsy) examined. Of these 17, 8 demonstrated CGD-associated chorioretinal lesions in at least one eye on histopathology. Of these 8, 7 showed amplification of 16S ribosomal DNA within the lesion; of these 7, two also amplified S. epidermidis and one P. aeruginosa. One had no bacterial DNA amplified. Importantly, no microbial DNA was amplified from the normal, non-lesional ocular tissues of these 8 cases. Furthermore, only 1 of the 9 eyes without chorioretinopathy had amplified Burkholderia DNA, that patient had a history of Burkholderia infection. CONCLUSIONS: We detected bacterial DNA in 7 of 8 (88%) cases with CGD-associated chorioretinopathy and only in 1 normal ocular tissue of 17 CGD cases. Bacterial infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of CGD-associated chorioretinal lesions.
TI  - Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis on peritoneal dialysis catheters  and the effects of extracellular products from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis is a cause of infections related  to peritoneal dialysis (PD). We have used a PD catheter flow-cell model in combination with confocal scanning laser microscopy and atomic force microscopy to study biofilm formation by S. epidermidis. Adherence to serum-coated catheters was four times greater than to uncoated ones, suggesting that S. epidermidis binds to serum proteins on the catheter surface. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm supernatant interfered with the formation of a serum protein coat thereby reducing the capacity for biofilm formation in S. epidermidis. Supernatants from DeltapelA, DeltapslBCD and DeltarhlAB strains of P. aeruginosa showed no differences from the wild-type supernatant indicating that the effect on serum coat formation was not due to rhamnolipids or the PelA and PslBCD polysaccharides. Supernatant from P. aeruginosa also dispersed established S. epidermidis biofilms. Supernatants lacking PelA or PslBCD showed no differences from the wild type but that from a DeltarhlAB strain, showed reduced, but not abolished, capacity for dispersal. This suggests that rhamnolipids are involved but not wholly responsible for the effect. Thus, supernatants from P. aeruginosa contain promising substances for the prevention and treatment of biofilm infections, although further work is required to identity more active components.
TI  - Detour of prenostodione synthesis towards pyrazolones for antibacterial activity.
AB  - Our attempts to prepare indolyl acid (3), enroute to prenostodione (2), from phenyl-hydrazine following a reported procedure of Fischer-Indole synthesis rather lead to ethyl 2-(5-oxo-1-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)acetate as a major product, which underwent facile condensation with aldehydes to provide the pyrazolones. Intrigued by the opportunity for the diversity oriented synthesis of substituted pyrazolones, we have developed a facile one pot approach for pyrazolones and screened for antibacterial activity and, herein, results are reported.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity of 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides.
AB  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial activity (MIC) of novel 1-methyl-3-sulfonylthio-4-aminoquinolinium chlorides 2 are described. Compounds 2 were obtained in the reaction of 1-methyl-4-aminoquinolinium 3-thiolates 1 with sulfonyl chlorides. Antimicrobial activity of compounds 2 was investigated using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtericum and Gram-negative Escherichia coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains as well as Candida albicans. The investigated compounds exhibited growth-inhibitory activity towards Gram-positive bacteria in the 4-64 microg/mL range whereas that towards Gram-negative bacteria covered the 128-1024 microg/mL range. The highest activity was shown by compound 2c, featuring a phenylsulfonylthio substituent in the 3-quinoline position and a 4-chlorophenylamine group in the position 4. All of the investigated compounds 2 showed antifungal activity in the 32-128 microg/mL range. Correlations between antimicrobial activity and chemical structure of the tested compounds were observed.
TI  - [Species and drug resistance of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the species and percentage changes of pathogens in blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward, and to analyze the drug resistance of main pathogens and the risk factors for positive blood culture (sepsis). METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed to analyze the species and drug sensitivity of the pathogens isolated from 2358 blood cultures from the pediatric hematology ward of the West China Second University Hospital between 2008 and 2011, as well as the related clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 110 strains of pathogens were isolated, with Escherichia coli (16 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12 strains) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (8 strains) being the most common ones. From 2008 to 2011, the percentage of Gram-positive bacteria decreased, while the percentage of Gram-negative bacteria increased. The detection rates of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were 69% and 43% respectively, but both were sensitive to vancomycin. The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae were 69% and 62% respectively, but both were sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. Malignant tumor was a risk factor for positive blood culture (OR=3.564, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of pathogens are responsible for bloodstream infection in the pediatric hematology ward and the percentages of bacteria are changing; these pathogens have a high drug resistance rate. Malignant tumor is a risk factor for positive blood culture in the pediatric hematology ward.
TI  - Effects of shear on initial bacterial attachment in slow flowing systems.
AB  - Initial bacterial attachment, likely affected by local shear, could influence biofilm formation. However, there are contradictory reports for the shear effects on attachment of different bacteria onto different surfaces. In this study, four bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, were examined for their attachment to glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass under different shears. Polystyrene particles were used to verify that their shear dependent attachment on glass and OTS could be interpreted using an analysis based on the extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (XDLVO) theory. In particular, the critical shear force (F(c-shear)) could correlate with the maximum attractive force (F(MAX)(XDLVO)) toward the secondary energy minimum as F(c-shear)=cF(MAX)(XDLVO). For these particles, c of ~1 was obtained, the value was within the coefficient range (0.1-1) of substances sliding over glass. For S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa on glass, c was 0.3, <0.6 and 0.2, respectively. When considering potential protein adsorption on OTS during bacterial attachment, c of these species on OTS was slightly above 1. A greatly enhanced attachment of P. aeruginosa on OTS was also observed, probably due to the presence of flagella. For P. putida, the attachment first decreased slightly or maintained with shear and then increased. Such behaviors were probably caused by the increased secretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) at higher shears by P. putida. The results from this study suggested that, without complications from surface features/EPS, the analysis based on the XDLVO theory could provide a basis for understanding shear effect on initial bacterial attachment.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols.
AB  - We report in this work the preparation and in vitro antimicrobial evaluation of novel amphiphilic aromatic amino alcohols synthesized by reductive amination of 4-alkyloxybenzaldehyde with 2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol. The antibacterial activity was determined against four standard strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and 21 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The antifungal activity was evaluated against four yeast (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida glabrata and Candida parapsilosis). The results obtained showed a strong positive correlation between the lipophilicity and the antibiotic activity of the tested compounds. The best activities were obtained against the Gram-positive bacteria (MIC=2-16mugml(-1)) for the five compounds bearing longer alkyl chains (4c-g; 8-14 carbons), which were also the most active against Candida (MIC=2-64mugml(-1)). Compound 4e exhibited the highest levels of inhibitory activity (MIC=2-16mugml(-1)) against clinical isolates of MRSA. A concentration of twice the MIC resulted in bactericidal activity of 4d against 19 of the 21 clinical isolates.
TI  - Cytotoxic (A549) and antimicrobial effects of Methylobacterium sp. isolate (ERI-135) from Nilgiris forest soil, India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Methylobacterium  sp. isolated from soil sample of Doddabetta forest, Nilgiris, Western Ghats of Tamil Nadu. METHODS: Isolation of Methylobacterium was performed from soils by serial dilution plate technique. The strain was grown in modified nutrient gulucose agar (MNGA) medium to study the morphology and biochemical characteristics. Methylobacterium sp. was screened for its antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The strain was subjected to 16S rRNA analysis and was identified as Methylobacterium sp. The nucleotide sequence of the 16S rRNA gene of the isolate exhibited close similarity with other Methylobacterium sp. and has been submitted to Genbank. The antibacterial substances were extracted using chloroform and ethyl acetate from MNGA medium in which ERI-135 had grown for 5 d at 30 degrees C. Cytotoxic effect was also studied. GC-MS analysis was carried out. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using broth micro dilution technique. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate extract showed activity against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureu and Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and fungi such as, Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations were: 250 microg/mL against S. epidermidis and 250microg/mL against K. pneumonia. The isolate had the ability to produce enzymes such as protease. The exyract showed cytotoxic effect in human adenocarcinoma cancer cell line (A549). GC-MS analysis showed the presence of isovaleric acid (3.64%), 2-Methylbutanoic acid (5.03%), isobutyramide (5.05%), N,N-oimethylformamide-di-t-butylacetal (9.79%), benzeneacetamide (15.56%), octyl butyl phthalate (3.59%) and diisooctyl phthalate (5.79) in the extract. CONCLUSIONS: Methylobacterium sp. (ERI-135) showed promising antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. This is the first report in the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effect of Methylobacterium sp.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of new 2-azetidinones with sulfonamide structures.
AB  - New series of N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamides 4a1-6, 4b1-6 and N-(4-aryl-3-chloro-2-oxoazetidin-1-yl)aminoacetyl sulfonamides 5a1-6, 5b1-6 were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives was confirmed using spectral methods (FT-IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR). The antibacterial activities of these compounds against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6583, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 25912) and Gram negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae CIP 53153, Proteus vulgaris CIP 104989, Citrobacter freundii CIP 5732, Enterobacter cloacae CIP 103475, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa CIP 82118) bacterial strains were evaluated using the broth micro-dilution method. Compound 4a2 displayed the highest antibacterial activity, especially against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antioxidant potential of the synthesized compounds was also investigated according to ferric reducing power, total antioxidant activity and DPPH radical scavenging assays. All tested compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity in comparison with sulfadiazine and sulfisoxazole which were used as parent sulfonamides. Moreover, some of them showed an antioxidant activity comparable with that of ascorbic acid. In general, the compounds designed based on a sulfadiazine skeleton (compounds 4a1-6, 5a1-6) are more active than those obtained from sulfisoxazole (compounds 4b1-6, 5b1-6), and the N-(arylidene)hydrazinoacetyl sulfonamide derivatives 4a1-6, 4b1-6 are more active than their azetidionone analogues 5a1-6, 5b1-6.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Endophthalmitis isolates and antibiotic susceptibilities: a 10-year review of culture-proven cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing culture-proven endophthalmitis and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobial agents over 10 years. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all cases with culture-proven endophthalmitis at a single institution from 2002 through 2011. The outcome measures included all intravitreal isolates identified as well as antibiotic susceptibilities. RESULTS: A total of 448 organisms were isolated during the study interval. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 30.1% (135/448), Streptococcus viridians group in 10.9% (49/448), Staphylococcus aureus in 7.8% (35/448), Candida albicans in 5.8% (26/443), other coagulase-negative staphylococci in 6.0% (27/448), Propionibacterium acnes in 4.7% (21/448), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3.1% (14/448). Overall, 327 (72.9%) of 448 isolates were gram-positive organisms, 48 (10.7%) of 448 isolates were gram-negative organisms, 71 (15.8%) of 448 isolates were fungi, and 2 (0.4%) of 448 isolates were viruses. For gram-positive organisms, susceptibilities were the following: vancomycin, 100%; gentamicin, 88.0%; sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 77.5%; levofloxacin, 58.5%; oxacillin, 54.7%; ciprofloxacin, 51.0%; gatifloxacin, 51.0%; and moxifloxacin, 47.0%. For gram-negative organisms, susceptibilities were the following: ceftazidime, 100%; levofloxacin, 100%; ciprofloxacin, 95.0%; tobramycin, 90.6%; gentamicin, 80.6%; and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, 59.4%. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from eyes with endophthalmitis. Combination therapy generally is the recommendation as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis. Appropriate history and characteristic clinical features may guide the use of initial antifungal agents.
TI  - Synthesis and concentration dependent antibacterial activities of CuO nanoflakes.
AB  - We report, synthesis and antibacterial activities of CuO nanoflakes. CuO nanoparticles are prepared at room temperature through sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction studies show the particles are monoclinic (crystalline) in nature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images clearly show that the prepared particles are flake like in structure. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibits three different bands that correspond to the Au and Bu modes. Antibacterial studies were performed on Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholera, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas liquefaciens bacterial strains. Among these bacterial strains, S. flexneri and B. subtilis are most sensitive to copper oxide nanoparticles than the positive control (Penicillin G) and S. typhimurium strain shows the less sensitive. Results show that sensitivity is highly dependent on the concentrations of CuO nanoflakes.
TI  - An investigation of the biochemical properties of tetrazines as potential coating additives.
AB  - 1,2,4,5-Tetrazine and its 3,6-disubstituted derivatives are currently used for a  range of industrial and medical applications as they exhibit particular coordination chemistries, characterised by electron and charge transfer phenomena. The aim of the present work is to synthesise two tetrazine derivatives, namely 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DHDTZ) and 1,2,4,5-tetrazine dicarboxylic acid (DCTZ), and determine their antibacterial, antioxidant and anticorrosion characteristics as additives in a sol-gel coating on SS316L steel. The structure of the tetrazines was confirmed by NMR and FTIR while the surface morphology of bacterial cells in their presence was observed by AFM. Their ability to inhibit corrosion on 316L stainless steel was electrochemically determined using a potentiodynamic scanning (PDS) technique. The corrosion inhibition results showed that the acidic DCTZ provided the best corrosion protection. The concentration-dependent antioxidant capacity of the tetrazines was confirmed by both DPPH radical scavenging activity and FRAP assays, showing higher activity for DHDTZ than DCTZ. Furthermore, a DHDTZ doped sol-gel solution was prepared and curing parameter (temperature and time) was optimised for coating on microtitre wells and stainless steel panel. The antibacterial activity of the coated surfaces against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and the biofilm forming bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis CSF 41498 was determined. DHDTZ showed significantly higher antibacterial activities with MIC as low as 31 ppm compared to 250 ppm for DCTZ.
TI  - Antibiotic selection for the treatment of infectious complications of implant-based breast reconstruction.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection requiring explantation remains the most devastating complication associated with implant-based breast reconstruction. There are many treatment algorithms to prevent reconstructive failure in face of infection using both oral and intravenous antibiotics. In the absence of patient-specific culture data, antibiotic selection is generally directed toward broad-spectrum coverage based on historical data. We hypothesize that reviewing our institution's microbiology data obtained from explanted implant-based breast reconstructions would provide a rational basis for antibiotic selection in the future. METHODS: A retrospective review of 902 consecutive immediate implant-based breast reconstructions at a single institution from November 2007 to May 2011 was conducted. Implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology were identified. Patient demographics, implant characteristics, presence of skin necrosis, microbiological data, and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-three (4.76%) implant reconstructions requiring explantation or drainage by interventional radiology met the inclusion criteria for this study. Five patients (11.6%) had round, smooth silicone implants, and 36 (88.4%) had textured tissue expanders. Twenty-six implants were explanted because of infection; 3, because of exposure from skin necrosis; and 11, because of the combination of flap necrosis and infection; and 1, secondarily because of cancer invasion into the skin. Reconstruction was salvaged in 21 breasts (51.2%): 12 (57.1%) by implant reconstruction, 5 (23.8%) by pedicled latissimus dorsi flaps, and 4 (19.1%) with a microvascular free flap. Thirty explants had microbiology data available. The most common organism isolated was Staphylococcus epidermidis (10), followed by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (5), Serratia marcescens (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), enterococcus (3), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter (2), group B streptococcus (1), and Morganella morganii (1). Forty percent of the organisms were resistant to cefazolin; however, 86% were sensitive to gentamicin, 80% were sensitive to Levaquin, and 63% were sensitive to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: Infection associated with implant-based breast reconstructions continues to threaten explantation and reconstructive failure. Based on our microbiological data, initial cellulitis amenable to oral antibiotics should be treated with oral fluoroquinolones as a first-line treatment. If this regimen fails, intravenous imipenem or gentamicin and vancomycin should be initiated. Obviously, clinical judgment regarding specific patient risk factors and compliance should play a role in decision making, but these data provide an evidence-based rationale for first-line oral antibiotic selection.
TI  - [Microbial and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX].
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic joint infection is a feared complication in total hip arthroplasty. The use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is the important part of preventive and therapeutic strategies. At present a number of commercial bone cements are available and support of their use by the results of experimental trials and clinical studies has varied. In relation to this issue we studied essential microbiological and pharmacological characteristics of VancogenX in comparison with gentamicin-loaded bone cement used conventionally. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on a previously described protocol, we tested pellets of four commercial bone cements, namely, Hi-Fatigue G, Palacos R+G, VancogenX, and Palacos R as a control. Bone cement was prepared in a vacuum-mixing system. The strains used for bacterial load included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Each cement was tested for its antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities and the results were evaluated by standard methods. In addition, we investigated time-related release of gentamicin and vancomycin from the bone cements tested. RESULTS: All antibiotic-loaded cement pellets were able to prevent growth of the bacterial strains tested. The bactericidal effect lasted for several days in relation to the bacterial species and cement used, with the exception of S. epidermidis whose growth was inhibited by gentamicin-loaded cement only for one day. The antibiotic-loaded pellets also prevented the formation of a biofilm for 24 hours at least. The major amount of vancomycin (32.915 mg/l) was released from VancogenX to MH medium within 24 hours and the last measureable amount (4.327 mg/l) was recorded at 48 hours after the start of the experiment. In physiological saline the highest level of vancomycin was 139.852 mg/ml measured at 24 hours, and the antibiotic was detectable at a level of 2.334 mg/ml as late as 8 days after the experiment started. Release of gentamicin from VancogenX was as follows: the 24-hour level was higher in MH medium than physiological saline (178 versus 131.4 mg/ml); however, gentamicin was still detectable in physiological saline at 192 hours after the start of the experiment while no gentamicin was found in MH medium after 72 hours. DISCUSSION: The antimicrobial effect of VancogenX bone cement was not an unexpected finding since both gentamicin and vancomycin have been used with bone cement for a long time and their combination is optimal in terms of preventing prosthetic joint infection. However, there is a disputable issue of poor release of vancomycin from bone cement. In MH medium we were able to detect the vancomycin released from VancogenX only for two days after the initial rapid elution while its release into physiological saline seemed to be slower but much longer. It is possible that more vancomycin is released from bone cement, but this amount is immediately bound to proteins in the cement vicinity and this process is not detectable by any analytical method. CONCLUSIONS: The bone cement VancogenX showed excellent antimicrobial and antibiofilm properties and can be recommended for use in orthopaedic practice. Therapy of prosthetic joint infection is the main indication. Extension of the indication to the prevention of prosthetic joint infection in high-risk patients should be preceded by biomechanical studies demonstrating that the cement is appropriate for long-term implant fixation.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Antiseptic cyclodextrin-functionalized hydrogels and gauzes for loading and delivery of benzalkonium chloride.
AB  - Prevention and management of wound infections receive a lot of attention, since the presence of micro-organisms interferes with the wound-healing process. The aim of this work was to use cyclodextrins (CDs) to endow hydrogels and gauzes with the ability to take up antiseptics and sustain their delivery for several hours. Benzalkonium chloride (BzCl) can form inclusion complexes with cross-linked CDs that regulate the release through an affinity-driven mechanism. Grafting of CDs to cotton gauzes using citric acid as the linker, at 190 degrees C and for 15 min, led to grafting yields of about 148%, much larger than those obtained at 180 degrees C or with shorter reaction times. Microbiological tests revealed that the BzCl-loaded networks can inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli both on agar plates and in liquid medium. Furthermore, the antiseptic-loaded gauzes were able to inhibit biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus RN1HG pMV158GFP when applied in early stages of biofilm formation and could reduce the number of living cells in preformed biofilms grown in a chronic wound biofilm model. These findings highlight the role of CDs as main components of hydrogels and gauzes for the efficient delivery of antiseptics.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Cattle tick-associated bacteria exert anti-biofilm and anti-Tritrichomonas foetus activities.
AB  - Research on microbiota in cattle tick and the evaluation of its activity against  other microorganisms can contribute to identify new molecules potentially useful to control infections caused by bacteria and protozoa. Biofilms pose increasing problems worldwide, mainly due to their resistance to antimicrobial therapies and host immune response. In this study we investigate the ability Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus-associated bacteria may exhibit to produce anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal compounds. Gut, ovary, salivary glands, and Gene organ were collected from engorged R. microplus female. Homogenates of each tissue were inoculated onto 15 distinct culture media. Anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal activities were analyzed by culturing each bacterium isolated in a liquid medium. Results showed that R. microplus cattle tick microflora varies for different tissues. Bacteria belonging to different genera (Aeromonas, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Castelaniella, Comamonas, Kocuria, and Microbacterium) were identified. Interestingly, all bacterial species found displayed pronounced activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, and also against the cattle pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus, confirming the hypothesis that cattle tick could be a source of bacteria active against pathogens. This is the first study showing that bacteria isolated from a tick exert anti-biofilm and trichomonicidal activities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SHMG) and edetate disodium (EDTA), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% SHMG and 0.1% EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U.S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (SHMG/EDTA) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.
TI  - A steroidal molecule present in the egg wax of the tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus inhibits bacterial biofilms.
AB  - The cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus lays eggs in the soil near the roots of grass, or in similar highly moist environments that are prone to biofilm formation. Tick eggs have a protective wax coating that may be a source of nutrients for microorganisms. However, as the eggs remain viable and show no visible signs of microbial colonization, we hypothesized that the coating might have anti-biofilm properties. We show here that the coating inhibits biofilm formation by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, though by different mechanisms. We have identified the anti-biofilm molecule as N-(3-sulfooxy-25-cholest-5-en-26-oyl)-L-isoleucine (boophiline), and we show that it inhibits the expression of fliC (flagellin) and cdrA (biofilm scaffold), whose products are necessary for biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Boophiline is a novel biofilm inhibitor being also effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm. In our study we show evidences of the boophiline mode of action in the protection of arthropod eggs against biofilm colonization.
TI  - Antimicrobial isothiocyanates from the seeds of Moringa oleifera Lam.
AB  - 4-(alpha-L-Rhamnosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate (1) and 4-(4'-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnosyloxy)-benzyl isothiocyanate (2) isolated from Moringa oleifera seeds were screened for their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for their antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Epidermophyton floccosum using the disk diffusion method. Isothiocyanates 1 and 2 were found active at the lowest inhibitory concentration of 1 mg/ml against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. subtilis) and against the dermatophytic fungi E. floccosum and T. rubrum. Statistically significant differences were found between the mean inhibition zones (IZ) of 1 and 2 and the standard drugs, ofloxacin and clotrimazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values confirmed the good antimicrobial activity of 1 and 2 against S. aureus, good to moderate activity against S. epidermidis, moderate activity against B. subtilis, and weak activity against E. floccosum and T. rubrum. The in vitro bactericidal effect of 1 and 2 against the Gram-positive bacterial strains tested is suggested by MBC:MIC ratios of 2:1.
TI  - Direct electric current treatment under physiologic saline conditions kills Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms via electrolytic generation of hypochlorous acid.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which a direct electrical current reduced the viability of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms in conjunction with ciprofloxacin at physiologic saline conditions meant to approximate those in an infected artificial joint. Biofilms grown in CDC biofilm reactors were exposed to current for 24 hours in 1/10(th) strength tryptic soy broth containing 9 g/L total NaCl. Dose-dependent log reductions up to 6.7 log(10) CFU/cm(2) were observed with the application of direct current at all four levels (0.7 to 1.8 mA/cm(2)) both in the presence and absence of ciprofloxacin. There were no significant differences in log reductions for wells with ciprofloxacin compared to those without at the same current levels. When current exposures were repeated without biofilm or organics in the medium, significant generation of free chlorine was measured. Free chlorine doses equivalent to the 24 hour endpoint concentration for each current level were shown to mimic killing achieved by current application. Current exposure (1.8 mA/cm(2)) in medium lacking chloride and amended with sulfate, nitrate, or phosphate as alternative electrolytes produced diminished kills of 3, 2, and 0 log reduction, respectively. Direct current also killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms when NaCl was present. Together these results indicate that electrolysis reactions generating hypochlorous acid from chloride are likely a main contributor to the efficacy of direct current application. A physiologically relevant NaCl concentration is thus a critical parameter in experimental design if direct current is to be investigated for in vivo medical applications.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) polyphenols.
AB  - We investigated the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from raw shelled and roasted salted pistachios. American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), food and clinical isolates, of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mirabilis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis and the fungus Aspergillus niger were used. Pistachio extracts were active against Gram-positive bacteria with a bactericidal effect observed against L. monocytogenes (ATCC strains and food isolates), S. aureus and MRSA clinical isolates. Extracts from raw shelled pistachios were more active than those from roasted salted pistachios. The bactericidal activity of pistachio extracts could be used to help control the growth of some microorganisms in foods to improve safety and may find application as a topical treatment for S. aureus.
TI  - An in vitro evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy of primary root canal filling materials.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to evaluate and compare six different materials commonly used for filling the root canals of primary teeth for antimicrobial efficacy against some of the microorganisms commonly found in infected root canals. STUDY DESIGN: In this experimental in vitro study six root canal filling materials were tested for antimicrobial efficacy against eight microbial strains using the agar diffusion method. RESULTS: Zinc oxide eugenol paste exhibited the strongest antimicrobial potential followed by Endoflas, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide-sodium fluoride mixture, zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture and calcium hydroxide paste (Apexcal). The addition of sodium fluoride to the zinc oxide-calcium hydroxide mixture enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy. Metapex demonstrated minimal inhibition and Vaseline was non-inhibitory. CONCLUSIONS: All the test filling materials demonstrated varying antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested. Zinc oxide eugenol paste and materials containing zinc oxide were found to be more effective against the microorganisms compared to materials without zinc oxide.
TI  - First syntheses of the biologically active fungal metabolites pestalotiopsones A, B, C and F.
AB  - A synthetic approach accessing the pestalotiopsones, fungal chromones possessing  a rare skeletal subtype, is reported for the first time. The synthesis of pestalotiopsone A (1) has been achieved in 7 linear steps (28%), from commercially available 3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid and subsequently the first syntheses of pestalotiopsone B (2), C (3) and F (4) were performed utilising this chemistry. The key steps include a newly described homologation of a substituted benzoic acid to afford phenylacetate derivatives utilising Birch reductive alkylation conditions, a microwave mediated chromanone formation proceeding through an oxa-Michael cyclisation, and an IBX induced dehydrogenation to the desired chromone skeleton. The synthetic natural products were completely characterised for the first time, confirming their structures and their biological activities evaluated against a panel of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - A nanoparticulate injectable hydrogel as a tissue engineering scaffold for multiple growth factor delivery for bone regeneration.
AB  - Gellan xanthan gels have been shown to be excellent carriers for growth factors and as matrices for several tissue engineering applications. Gellan xanthan gels along with chitosan nanoparticles of 297 +/- 61 nm diameter, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) were employed in a dual growth factor delivery system to promote the differentiation of human fetal osteoblasts. An injectable system with ionic and temperature gelation was optimized and characterized. The nanoparticle loaded gels showed significantly improved cell proliferation and differentiation due to the sustained release of growth factors. A differentiation marker study was conducted, analyzed, and compared to understand the effect of single vs dual growth factors and free vs encapsulated growth factors. Dual growth factor loaded gels showed a higher alkaline phosphatase and calcium deposition compared to single growth factor loaded gels. The results suggest that encapsulation and stabilization of growth factors within nanoparticles and gels are promising for bone regeneration. Gellan xanthan gels also showed antibacterial effects against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, the common pathogens in implant failure.
TI  - The effect of commonly used sutures on inflammation inducing pathogens - an in vitro study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sutures are a vital part of nearly every surgical procedure designed to close and stabilize wound margins consequently allowing undisturbed wound healing. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate in vitro antimicrobial effect of 4 commonly used sutures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Direct Contact Test was used to evaluate the antibacterial properties of 4 types of sutures: 2 absorbable and 2 non-absorbable braided sutures, immediately or after aging for 2 or 7 days. The tested bacteria were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The absorbable Vicryl Plus exhibited a bactericidal effect against the Staphylococcus strains, which was unaffected by aging. With P. aeruginosa, there was only an initial delay in bacterial growth. All other tested sutures did not have antibacterial effects against any of the tested bacteria (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vicryl Plus had sustained bactericidal effect against the Staphylococcus strains but not against P. aeruginosa. None of the other sutures presented any antibacterial properties.
TI  - Oxidation-sensing regulator AbfR regulates oxidative stress responses, bacterial  aggregation, and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis is a notorious human pathogen that is the major cause  of infections related to implanted medical devices. Although redox regulation involving reactive oxygen species is now recognized as a critical component of bacterial signaling and regulation, the mechanism by which S. epidermidis senses and responds to oxidative stress remains largely unknown. Here, we report a new oxidation-sensing regulator, AbfR (aggregation and biofilm formation regulator) in S. epidermidis. An environment of oxidative stress mediated by H(2)O(2) or cumene hydroperoxide markedly up-regulates the expression of abfR gene. Similar to Pseudomonas aeruginosa OspR, AbfR is negatively autoregulated and dissociates from promoter DNA in the presence of oxidants. In vivo and in vitro analyses indicate that Cys-13 and Cys-116 are the key functional residues to form an intersubunit disulfide bond upon oxidation in AbfR. We further show that deletion of abfR leads to a significant induction in H(2)O(2) or cumene hydroperoxide resistance, enhanced bacterial aggregation, and reduced biofilm formation. These effects are mediated by derepression of SERP2195 and gpxA-2 that lie immediately downstream of the abfR gene in the same operon. Thus, oxidative stress likely acts as a signal to modulate S. epidermidis key virulence properties through AbfR.
TI  - Photoinactivation of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer eosin Y.
AB  - We test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin Y upon conjugation. The conjugate eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Photoinactivation assays were performed against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AYE, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Partitioning assays were performed with E. coli and S. aureus . Photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) CFU/mL of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 muM or below. In contrast, neither eosin Y nor (KLAKLAK)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. The increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (KLAKLAK)(2) promotes the association of eosin Y to bacteria. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines HaCaT, COS-7, and COLO 316. Consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. The peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin Y toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. Overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (KLAKLAK)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.
TI  - Monitoring mitochondrial inner membrane potential for detecting early changes in  viability of bacterium-infected human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One of the most challenging safety issues in the manufacture of cell based medicinal products is the control of microbial risk as cell-based products cannot undergo terminal sterilization. Accordingly, sensitive and reliable methods for detection of microbial contamination are called for. As mitochondrial function has been shown to correlate with the viability and functionality of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) we have studied the use of a mitochondrial inner membrane potential sensitive dye for detecting changes in the function of mitochondria following infection by bacteria. METHODS: The effect of bacterial contamination on the viability of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) was studied. BMMSC lines were infected with three different bacterial species, namely two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and three strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The changes in viability of the BMMSCs after bacterial infection were studied by staining with Trypan blue, by morphological analysis and by monitoring of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential. RESULTS: Microscopy and viability assessment by Trypan blue staining showed that even the lowest bacterial inocula caused total dissipation of BMMSCs within 24 hours of infection, similar to the effects seen with bacterial loads which were several magnitudes higher. The first significant signs of damage induced by the pathogens became evident after 6 hours of infection. Early changes in mitochondrial inner membrane potential of BMMSCs were evident after 4 hours of infection even though no visible changes in viability of the BMMSCs could be seen. CONCLUSIONS: Even low levels of bacterial contamination can cause a significant change in the viability of BMMSCs. Moreover, monitoring the depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential may provide a rapid tool for early detection of cellular damage induced by microbial infection. Accordingly, mitochondrial analyses offer sensitive tools for quality control and monitoring of safety and efficacy of cellular therapy products.
TI  - Retrospective study of microorganisms associated with vascular access infections  in hemodialysis patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess microorganisms associated with vascular access-associated infections (VAIs) in hemodialysis patients, with respect to possible origin from the mouth. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective and comparative analysis of the microbes associated with VAI in hemodialysis patients treated during a 10-year period was performed with the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD). RESULTS: Of 218 patient records identified, 65 patients collectively experienced 115 VAI episodes. The most common microorganisms involved were Staphylococcus aureus (49.6% of infections), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.4%), Serratia marcescens (10.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.6%), and Enterococcus faecalis/fecum (8.7%). None of these was found in >/=1% of HOMD clone libraries, indicating that they very rarely colonize the teeth or plaque. CONCLUSIONS: Most VAIs were associated with microorganisms more likely to originate from other body sites than from the oral cavity. The risk of a VAI being caused by microorganisms originating from the oral cavity is very small.
TI  - Evidence of extensive diversity in bacterial adherence mechanisms that exploit unanticipated stainless steel surface structural complexity for biofilm formation.
AB  - Three protease-resistant bioorganic 304 stainless steel surfaces were created through the reaction of synthetic peptides consisting of the D-enantiomeric isomer (D-K122-4), the retro-inverso D-enantiomeric isomer (RI-K122-4), and a combination of the two peptides (D+RI) of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilA receptor binding domain with steel surfaces. The peptides used to produce the new materials differ only in handedness of their three-dimensional structure, but they reacted with the steel to yield materials that differed in their surface electron work function (EWF) while displaying an identical chemical composition and equivalent surface adhesive force properties. These surfaces allowed for an assessment of the relative role of surface EWF in initial biofilm formation. We examined the ability of various bacteria (selected strains of Listeria monocytogenes, L. innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) to initiate biofilm formation. The D-K1224 generated surface displayed the lowest EWF (classically associated with greater molecular interactions and more extensive biofilm formation) but was observed to be least effectively colonized by bacteria (>50% decrease in bacterial adherence of all strains). The highest surface EWF with the lowest surface free energy (RI-K122-4 generated) was more extensively colonized by bacteria, with the binding of some strains being equivalent to unmodified steel. The D+RI generated surface was least effective in minimizing biofilm formation, where some strains displayed enhanced bacterial colonization. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that the D and RI peptides displayed similar but clearly different binding patterns, suggesting that the peptides recognized different sites on the steel, and that differential binding of the peptides to the steel surfaces influences the binding of different bacterial strains and species. We have demonstrated that stainless steel surfaces can be easily modified by peptides to generate surfaces with new physiochemical properties. The D-K122-4-modified surface substantially decreases biofilm formation compared to the RI-K122-4 and D+RI surfaces.
TI  - Effect of rhamnolipids on initial attachment of bacteria on glass and octadecyltrichlorosilane-modified glass.
AB  - Bacterial attachment on solid surfaces has various implications in environmental, industrial and medical applications. In this study, the effects of rhamnolipid biosurfactants on initial attachment of bacteria on hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) modified glass were evaluated under continuous-flow conditions. The bacteria investigated were three Gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, and Escherichia coli, and two Gram-positive species Staphylcoccus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis. Rhamnolipids, at 10 and 200 mg/l, significantly reduced the attachment of all but S. epidermidis on both glass and OTS-modified glass. For S. epidermidis rhamnolipids reduced the attachment on OTS-modified glass but not on glass. Studies were further done to identify the mechanism(s) by which rhamnolipids reduced the cell attachment. The following potential properties of rhamnolipids were investigated: inhibition of microbial growth, change of cell surface hydrophobicity, easier detachment of cells already attached to substratum, and modification of substratum surface properties. Results showed that rhamnolipids were ineffective for the latter two effects. Rhamnolipids, up to 200mg/l, inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa PAO1 but not the growth of E. coli, P. putida and P. aeruginosa E0340. Also, rhamnolipids tended to increase the hydrophobicity of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and E. coli, decrease the hydrophobicity of P. putida and S. epidermidis, and have no clear effect on the hydrophobicity of B. subtillis. These trends however did not correlate with the observed trend of cell attachment reduction. The responsible mechanism(s) remained unknown.
TI  - [Comparison of culture and real-time PCR methods in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in acute otitis media effusion specimens].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the major etiologic agents of acute otitis media. This study was aimed to compare the detection rate of S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae by culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (Rt-PCR) in the middle ear effusions of patients diagnosed as acute otitis media. A total of 60 middle ear effusion samples collected from children with acute otitis media were included in the study. The samples were inoculated and incubated in BACTEC Ped Plus blood culture bottles and BACTEC 9120 system (BD Diagnostic Systems, MD), respectively, and the isolates were identified by conventional methods. For the molecular diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae, ply pneumolysin gene and HIB capsule region, respectively were amplified by Rt-PCR (LightCycler, Roche Diagnostics, Germany). H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were isolated from 5 (8.3%) and 3 (5%) of the patient samples with conventional culture methods, respectively. In addition in 11.6% of the samples other microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus sanguinis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans) were also isolated. On the other hand H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were detected in 38 (63.3%) and 24 (40%) of the samples with Rt-PCR, respectively. There was about eight fold increase in the detection frequency of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae with Rt-PCR compared to culture methods. When culture was accepted as the gold standard method, the sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of Rt-PCR in the detection of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae were estimated as 80%, 51% and 98.2%, respectively. As a result, Rt-PCR was shown to be a sensitive method and could be preferred for the rapid diagnosis of H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae in the etiological diagnosis of acute otitis media, especially in culture negative cases.
TI  - Microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  - Sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (SSI). The present investigation characterized microbial recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (AB) and nonabsorbable (NAB) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. AB and NAB sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. At explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. Suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. A significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (P < 0.05) was noted. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected devices. No significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. Biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (P < 0.042). We conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. Further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of blended essential oil preparation.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of two blended essential oil preparations comprising lavender oil, petigrain oil, clary sage oil, ylang ylang oil and jasmine oil were evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms. Both preparations showed antimicrobial activity in the agar disc diffusion assay against the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538 and S. epidermidis isolated strain, the fungus, Candida albicans ATCC10231, and the Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, but showed no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of these preparations was evaluated. By the broth microdilution assay, preparation 1, comprising lavender oil, clary sage oil, and ylang ylang oil (volume ratio 3:4:3), exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity than preparation 2, which was composed of petigrain oil, clary sage oil, and jasmine oil (volume ratio 3:4:3). Moreover, the sum of the fractional inhibitory concentrations (Sigma fic) of preparation 1 expressed a synergistic antimicrobial effect against the tested microorganisms (Sigma fic<l). The blended essential oil preparations, characterized for their components by GC/MS, contained linalyl acetate, and linalool as major components. Our experiments showed that the differential antimicrobial effect of either blended oil preparations or single/pure essential oils may be influenced by the amount of linalool and linalyl acetate, and the number of active components in either the blended preparations or single/pure essential oils. In addition, blended oil preparations expressed synergistic antimicrobial effect by the accumulation of active components such as linalool and linalyl acetate and combining active constituents of more than one oil.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - Surface-grafted polysarcosine as a peptoid antifouling polymer brush.
AB  - Poly(N-substituted glycine) "peptoids" are a class of peptidomimetic molecules receiving significant interest as engineered biomolecules. Sarcosine (i.e., poly(N-methyl glycine)) has the simplest side chain chemical structure of this family. In this Article, we demonstrate that surface-grafted polysarcosine (PSAR) brushes exhibit excellent resistance to nonspecific protein adsorption and cell attachment. Polysarcosine was coupled to a mussel adhesive protein-inspired DOPA-Lys pentapeptide, which enabled solution grafting and control of the surface chain density of the PSAR brushes. Protein adsorption was found to decrease monotonically with increasing grafted chain densities, and protein adsorption could be completely inhibited above certain critical chain densities specific to different polysarcosine chain lengths. The dependence of protein adsorption on chain length and density was also investigated by a molecular theory. PSAR brushes at high chain length and density were shown to resist fibroblast cell attachment over a 7 week period, as well as resist the attachment of some clinically relevant bacterial strains. The excellent antifouling performance of PSAR may be related to the highly hydrophilic character of polysarcosine, which was evident from high-pressure liquid chromatography measurements of polysarcosine and water contact angle measurements of the PSAR brushes. Peptoids have been shown to resist proteolytic degradation, and polysarcosine could be produced in large quantities by N-carboxy anhydride polymerization. In summary, surface-grafted polysarcosine peptoid brushes hold great promise for antifouling applications.
TI  - Paediatric bacterial keratitis cases in Shanghai: microbiological profile, antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to review the microbiological profile, in  vitro antibiotic susceptibility and visual outcomes of paediatric microbial keratitis in Shanghai, China over the past 6 years. METHODS: Medical records of patients aged </=16 years were reviewed, who were diagnosed as having bacterial keratitis between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2010. Bacterial culture results and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility were analysed. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between visual impairment and possible risk factors. RESULTS: Eighty consecutive cases of paediatric bacterial keratitis cases were included, among which 59 were identified as having positive culture. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most commonly isolated organism (n=23; 39.0%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=11; 18.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=6; 10.2%). Antibiotic sensitivities revealed that tested bacteria had low resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides (8.3-18.4% and 12.5-24.4%, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis proved that visual impairment was significantly associated with Gram-negative bacterial infection (odds ratio (OR)=7.626; P=0.043) and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics (OR=0.385; P=0.040). CONCLUSIONS: S. epidermidis was the most common isolated organism in Shanghai paediatric keratitis. The fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides remained good choices for treating these patients. Gram-negative bacterial infection and an increasing number of resistant antibiotics were associated with worse visual prognoses in paediatric keratitis.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of zinc oxide nanorod surfaces.
AB  - Antibacterial coating approaches are being investigated to modify implants to reduce bacterial adhesion and viability in order to reduce implant-associated infection. Nanostructured materials possess unique surface properties, and nanotopographic surfaces have been reported to modulate bacterial adhesion. Zinc oxide (ZnO) films presenting well-controlled nanorod surface structures have recently been developed. To assess the efficacy of ZnO nanorod surfaces as an anti-bacterial coating, we evaluated bacterial adhesion and viability, compared to sputtered ZnO substrates (a relatively flat control) and glass substrates (as a reference). Common implant-associated pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were investigated. The number of adherent P. aeruginosa on ZnO nanorod surfaces was found to be reduced compared to glass and sputtered ZnO, while the adherent number of S. epidermidis on the ZnO nanorods was equivalent to glass. Regarding bacteria viability, the ZnO nanorod and sputtered ZnO surfaces demonstrated a modest, but significant bactericidal effect on adherent P. aeruginosa, killing 2.5-fold and 1.7-fold more over the number of dead P. aeruginosa on glass, respectively. A greater bactericidal effect of ZnO substrates on S. epidermidis was found, with sputtered ZnO and ZnO nanorod substrates killing -20-fold and 30-fold more over the number of dead S. epidermidis on glass, respectively. These data support the further investigation and optimization of ZnO nanorod coatings with potential for bacterial adhesion resistance and bactericidal properties.
TI  - Full and broad-spectrum in vivo eradication of catheter-associated biofilms using gentamicin-EDTA antibiotic lock therapy.
AB  - Biofilms that develop on indwelling devices are a major concern in clinical settings. While removal of colonized devices remains the most frequent strategy for avoiding device-related complications, antibiotic lock therapy constitutes an adjunct therapy for catheter-related infection. However, currently used antibiotic lock solutions are not fully effective against biofilms, thus warranting a search for new antibiotic locks. Metal-binding chelators have emerged as potential adjuvants due to their dual anticoagulant/antibiofilm activities, but studies investigating their efficiency were mainly in vitro or else focused on their effects in prevention of infection. To assess the ability of such chelators to eradicate mature biofilms, we used an in vivo model of a totally implantable venous access port inserted in rats and colonized by either Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that use of tetrasodium EDTA (30 mg/ml) as a supplement to the gentamicin (5 mg/ml) antibiotic lock solution associated with systemic antibiotics completely eradicated Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial biofilms developed in totally implantable venous access ports. Gentamicin-EDTA lock was able to eliminate biofilms with a single instillation, thus reducing length of treatment. Moreover, we show that this combination was effective for immunosuppressed rats. Lastly, we demonstrate that a gentamicin-EDTA lock is able to eradicate the biofilm formed by a gentamicin-resistant strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. This in vivo study demonstrates the potential of EDTA as an efficient antibiotic adjuvant to eradicate catheter-associated biofilms of major bacterial pathogens and thus provides a promising new lock solution.
TI  - Biofilm infections, their resilience to therapy and innovative treatment strategies.
AB  - Biofilm formation of microorganisms causes persistent tissue and foreign body infections resistant to treatment with antimicrobial agents. Up to 80% of human bacterial infections are biofilm associated; such infections are most frequently caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli. The accurate diagnosis of biofilm infections is often difficult, which prevents the appropriate choice of treatment. As biofilm infections significantly contribute to patient morbidity and substantial healthcare costs, novel strategies to treat these infections are urgently required. Nucleotide second messengers, c-di-GMP, (p)ppGpp and potentially c-di-AMP, are major regulators of biofilm formation and associated antibiotic tolerance. Consequently, different components of these signalling networks might be appropriate targets for antibiofilm therapy in combination with antibiotic treatment strategies. In addition, cyclic di-nucleotides are microbial-associated molecular patterns with an almost universal presence. Their conserved structures sensed by the eukaryotic host have a widespread effect on the immune system. Thus, cyclic di-nucleotides are also potential immunotherapeutic agents to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - [Microbiological monitoring in therapy of patients with iatrogenic esophageotracheal fistula].
AB  - The results of the microbiological diagnosis of infective inflammatory complications in patients with iatrogenic esophageotracheal fistula and the tactics of their antibacterial prophylaxis and therapy within a 9-year observation period (2003-2011) were analysed. The main organisms colonizing the tracheobronchial tree in the patients were S. epidermidis, S. aureus, enteric bacteria, P. aeruginosa and Candida. An increase of the S. epidermidis resistance to rifampicin, moxifloxacin and especially ciprofloxacin was observed. The resistance of S. aureus did not significantly change. Within the observation period, high susceptibility of all the Staphylococcus isolates to vancomycin and linezolid remained stable. Among the nonfermenting gramnegative bacteria, the P. aeruginosa isolates were the most frequent and characterized by a lower portion of the isolates with preserved susceptibility to the agents (except polymyxin B) known earlier as antipyocyanic antibiotics, i.e. to imipenem and cefepim. Since the proportion of P. aeruginosa in the etiology of pyoinflammatory processes in the region of esophageotracheal fistula ranged within 9.3 to 17.5%, the fact should be considered in the antibiotic therapy. There was observed an increase in the frequency of infectious complications due to other nonfermenting gramnegative bacteria (acinetobacters) and first of all A.baumannii. Various Candida isolates were characterized by dependence of the susceptibility on the selective pressure of irrational therapy, as well as their species (the presence of such species as C. Krusei and C. glabrata with natural resistance), that required not only the species identification but also determination of the Candida isolates resistance in every particular case.
TI  - A novel methylated sesquiterpene from seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of chloroform extract from the leaves of the marine plant Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile (Posidoniaceae), yielded posidozinol, a new methylated sesquiterpene along with beta-sitosterol and four known fatty acids: palmitic, palmitoleic, oleic and linoleic acids. The structure elucidation has been established on the basis of 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy, GS/MS and ES mass spectrometry. Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.
TI  - Coordination of thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazones) to bismuth(III) as a strategy for the design of metal-based antibacterial agents.
AB  - Complexes [Bi(2Fo4Ph)Cl(2)] (1), [Bi(2Ac4Ph)Cl(2)] (2), [Bi(2Bz4Ph)Cl(2)] (3), [Bi(H(2)Gy3DH)Cl(3)] (4), [Bi(H(2)Gy4Et)(OH)(2)Cl] (5), and [Bi(H(2)Gy4Ph)Cl(3)] (6) were prepared with pyridine-2-carbaldehyde 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Fo4Ph), 1-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanone 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Ac4Ph), phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanone 4-phenylthiosemicarbazone (H2Bz4Ph), as well as with glyoxaldehyde bis(thiosemicarbazone) (H(2)Gy4DH) and its 4-Et (H(2)Gy4Et) and 4-Ph (H(2)Gy4Ph) derivatives. The complexes exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Coordination to Bi(III) proved to be an effective strategy to increase the antibacterial activity of the thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazones).
TI  - Bacterial bloodstream infections in liver transplantation: etiologic agents and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
AB  - Liver transplantation (OLT) is a lifesaving procedure for the treatment of many end-stage liver diseases, but infection and acute rejection episodes still remain the main causes of morbidity and mortality. Bloodstream infections (BSIs), particularly, are the major cause of mortality among these patients. BSIs in OLT, are from intra-abdominal, biliary, respiratory, urinary, wound and/or central venous catheter sources. A certain percentage are of unknown origin. Using the computerized database of our microbiology laboratory, we analyzed all BSIs in 75 consecutive adult liver transplant patients in a single center between January 2008 and July 2011. BSIs occurred in 21/75 (28%) patients. Thirteen subjects had a single; two, two episodes, and the other six patients each >4 episodes. All episodes occurred in the first 60 days following OLT; the majority (74%), in the first month. Among 44 microorganisms recovered, 52.3% were gram-negative, the most frequent being Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae; 47.7% were gram-positive, the most frequent being coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis. Overall 65.9% of the isolates were resistant to several antibiotics: 40.9% displayed the multiding-resistant and 25% the panding-resistant phenotype. There was a high incidence of gram-negative and most importantly, resistant bacteria, which required appropriate therapy. These data showed that it is imperative to promote strategies to prevention and contain antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Decreased bacteria activity on Si(3)N(4) surfaces compared with PEEK or titanium.
AB  - A significant need exists for orthopedic implants that can intrinsically resist bacterial colonization. In this study, three biomaterials that are used in spinal implants--titanium (Ti), polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), and silicon nitride (Si(3)N(4))--were tested to understand their respective susceptibility to bacterial infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphlococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Specifically, the surface chemistry, wettability, and nanostructured topography of respective biomaterials, and the effects on bacterial biofilm formation, colonization, and growth were investigated. Ti and PEEK were received with as-machined surfaces; both materials are hydrophobic, with net negative surface charges. Two surface finishes of Si(3)N(4) were examined: as-fired and polished. In contrast to Ti and PEEK, the surface of Si(3)N(4) is hydrophilic, with a net positive charge. A decreased biofilm formation was found, as well as fewer live bacteria on both the as-fired and polished Si(3)N(4). These differences may reflect differential surface chemistry and surface nanostructure properties between the biomaterials tested. Because protein adsorption on material surfaces affects bacterial adhesion, the adsorption of fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin on Ti, PEEK, and Si(3)N(4) were also examined. Significantly greater amounts of these proteins adhered to Si(3)N(4) than to Ti or PEEK. The findings of this study suggest that surface properties of biomaterials lead to differential adsorption of physiologic proteins, and that this phenomenon could explain the observed in-vitro differences in bacterial affinity for the respective biomaterials. Intrinsic biomaterial properties as they relate to resistance to bacterial colonization may reflect a novel strategy toward designing future orthopedic implants.
TI  - Chemical composition, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the leaf essential oil of Juglans regia L. and its constituents.
AB  - The essential oil from the leaves of Juglans regia L. (Juglandaceae) growing wild in Kashmir (India) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by a combination of capillary GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of 38 compounds, representing 92.7% of the oil, were identified and the major components were found to be alpha-pinene (15.1%), beta-pinene (30.5%), beta-caryophyllene (15.5%) germacrene D (14.4%) and limonene (3.6%). The essential oil and the main individual constituents were screened for antibacterial activity and the essential oil evaluated for antioxidant activity. Antibacterial activity was evaluated using the disc diffusion and microdilution methods against a group of clinically significant Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis MTCC-435, Bacillus subtilis MTCC-441, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Proteus vulgaris MTCC-321, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC-1688, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dyssenteriae, Klebsiella pneumonia and Escherichia coli). The essential oil and its major components exhibited broad spectrum inhibition against all the bacterial strains with Gram-positive being more susceptible to the oil than Gram-negative bacteria. Antioxidant activity of the oil was evaluated by the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and hydroxyl radicals. In general, the essential oil exhibited high antioxidant activity which was comparable to the reference standards at the same dose (ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyl toluene, BHT) with IC(50) values of 34.5 and 56.4mug/ml calculated by DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging assays respectively.
TI  - [The changes of ocular bacterial isolates and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility in the past six years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the changes of ocular bacterial isolates and their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and tobramycin in Henan Province in the past six years. METHODS: Retrospective study of ocular bacterial isolates and their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results of Henan Eye Institute in the past six years. RESULTS: A total of 2044 bacterial isolates were classified into 39 kinds in the past six years, which were mainly from the conjunctival sac. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. All kinds of the ocular bacteria had the highest susceptibility to gatifloxacin (92.3%) among the tested drugs. Rods were more sensitive to quinolone drugs than cocci and gram-positive rods were more sensitive to tobramycin than the other types of germs. The drug's susceptibility of the four kinds of quinolone except ciprofloxacin decreased year by year with a decreasing ladder fashion every two years in the susceptibility change of levofloxacin in the past six years, while the susceptibility of tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased. Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptibility to every drug had the similar trend with the general changes in the past six years, that is, their susceptibility to ofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008, their susceptibility to gatifloxacin and tobramycin reduced significantly in 2009. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to all the drugs had no significant change, for all gram-negative rods, their susceptibility to the four kinds of quinolone drugs were higher than their susceptibility to tobramycin while their susceptibility to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin reduced significantly as time passed by, especially from the year 2008 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: The most common ocular bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ocular bacterial isolates' susceptibility to gatifloxacin in vitro was significantly higher than to other drugs in every year but decreased significantly in 2009 while their susceptibility to ofloxacin and levofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008. Their susceptibility to tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - DNA binding mode of novel tetradentate amino acid based 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine complexes.
AB  - Few transition metal complexes of tetradentate N(2)O(2) donor Schiff base ligands containing 2-hydroxybenzylidene-4-aminoantipyrine and amino acids (alanine/valine) abbreviated to KHL(1)/KHL(2) have been synthesized. All the metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The Schiff bases KHL(1)/KHL(2) are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around the metal ions. The binding behaviors of the complexes to calf thymus DNA have been investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. The DNA binding constants reveal that all these complexes interact with DNA through minor groove binding mode. The studies on mechanism of photocleavage reveal that singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and superoxide anion radical (O(2)(-)) may play an important role in the photocleavage. The Schiff bases and their metal complexes have been screened for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activities against Aspergillus niger, Fusarium solani, Culvularia lunata, Rhizoctonia bataicola and Candida albicans by MIC method.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of dextran-capped silver nanoparticles with enhanced antibacterial activity.
AB  - Dextran-capped silver nanoparticles were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate with NaBH4 in the presence of dextran as capping agent. The characters of silver nanoparticles were investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, nano-grainsize analyzer, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. Results showed that the silver nanoparticles capped with dextran were in uniform shape and narrow size distribution. Moreover, compared with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-capped silver nanoparticles, the dextran-capped ones possessed better stability. Antibacterial tests of these silver nanoparticles were carried out for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Results suggested that the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles had high antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, the cytotoxicity in vitro of the dextran-capped silver nanoparticles was investigated using mouse fibrosarcoma cells (L929). The toxicity was evaluated by the changes of cell morphology and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. Results indicated that these silver nanoparticles had slight effect on the survival and proliferation of L-929 cells at their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). After modified by dextran, the physiochemical properties of the silver nanoparticles had been improved. We anticipated that these dextran-capped silver nanoparticles could be integrated into systems for biological and pharmaceutical applications.
TI  - Antifouling foldable acrylic IOLs loaded with norfloxacin by aqueous soaking and  by supercritical carbon dioxide technology.
AB  - Cataracts treatment usually involves the extraction of the opaque crystalline lens and its replacement by an intraocular lens (IOL). A serious complication is the occurrence of endophthalmitis, a post-surgery infection mainly caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IOLs having the ability to load and to release norfloxacin in a controlled way and at efficient therapeutic levels may help to overcome these issues. In this work, acrylic hydrogels combining 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and 2-butoxyethyl methacrylate (BEM) at various ratios were prepared to attain biocompatible networks that can be foldable even in the dry state and thus insertable through minor ocular incision, and that load therapeutic amounts of norfloxacin. Acrylamide (AAm) and methacrylic acid (MAAc) were also incorporated as functional comonomers in small proportions. Water sorption, contact angle, protein adsorption, and optical properties of the networks were characterized. BEM notably decreased the T(g) of the networks, but also the loading by immersion in aqueous solution (presoaking). Then, a scCO(2)-based impregnation/deposition (SSI) method was implemented to improve the uptake of the drug. Loading capacities were discussed in terms of the comonomers composition and the employed method and operational conditions. The networks prepared with HEMA/BEM 20:80 vol/vol and processed with supercritical fluids combine adequate mechanical properties, biocompatibility and norfloxacin loading/release, and seem to be suitable for developing norfloxacin-eluting IOLs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of plasma from crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Siamese crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) is a critically endangered species of freshwater crocodiles. Crocodilians live with opportunistic bacterial infection but normally suffer no adverse effects. They are not totally immune to microbial infection, but their resistance thereto is remarkably effective. In this study, crude and purified plasma extracted from the Siamese crocodile were examined for antibacterial activity against clinically isolated, human pathogenic bacterial strains and the related reference strains. METHODS: Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile by differential sedimentation. The crude plasma was examined for antibacterial activity by the liquid growth inhibition assay. The scanning electron microscopy was performed to confirm the effect of crude crocodile plasma on the cells of Salmonella typhi ATCC 11778. Effect of crude crocodile plasma on cell viability was tested by MTT assay. In addition, the plasma was purified by anion exchange column chromatography with DEAE-Toyopearl 650 M and the purified plasma was tested for antibacterial activity. RESULTS: Crude plasma was prepared from whole blood of the Siamese crocodile and exhibited substantial antibacterial activities of more than 40% growth inhibition against the six reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the four clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Vibrio cholerae. Especially, more than 80% growth inhibition was found in the reference strains of Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis and in the clinical isolates of Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholerae. The effect of the crude plasma on bacterial cells of Salmonella typhi, a certain antibacterial material probably penetrates progressively into the cytoplasmic space, perturbing and damaging bacterial membranes. The effect of the crude plasma was not toxic by the yellow tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay using a macrophage-like cell, RAW 264.7. The pooled four fractions, designated as fractions D1-D4, were obtained by column chromatography, and only fraction D1 showed growth inhibition in the reference strains and the clinical, human pathogenic isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The crude and purified plasma from the Siamese crocodile significantly showed antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria and reference strains by damage cell membrane of target bacterial cells. From the MTT assay, the Siamese crocodile plasma was not cytotoxic to the cells.
TI  - A broad-range method to detect genomic DNA of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  - It remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. This work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16S rDNA region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (GNRs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property. In the quantitative detection of artificial sequence, the limit of detection (LOD) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pM level. This pair of universal GNRs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (PCs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing Serratia marcescens-spiked PCs. Therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective DNA analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in PCs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to unworn and worn silicone hydrogel lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial adhesion to various silicone hydrogel lens materials and to determine whether lens wear modulated adhesion. METHODS: Bacterial adhesion (total and viable cells) of Staphylococcus aureus (31, 38, and ATCC 6538) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6294, 6206, and GSU-3) to 10 commercially available different unworn and worn silicone hydrogel lenses was measured. Results of adhesion were correlated to polymer and surface properties of contact lenses. RESULTS: S. aureus adhesion to unworn lenses ranged from 2.8 x 10 to 4.4 x 10 colony forming units per lens. The highest adhesion was to lotrafilcon A lenses, and the lowest adhesion was to asmofilcon A lenses. P. aeruginosa adhesion to unworn lenses ranged from 8.9 x 10 to 3.2 x 10 colony forming units per lens. The highest adhesion was to comfilcon A lenses, and the lowest adhesion was to asmofilcon A and balafilcon A lenses. Lens wear altered bacterial adhesion, but the effect was specific to lens and strain type. Adhesion of bacteria, regardless of genera/species or lens wear, was generally correlated with the hydrophobicity of the lens; the less hydrophobic the lens surface, the greater the adhesion. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa adhered in higher numbers to lenses in comparison with S. aureus strains, regardless of the lens type or lens wear. The effect of lens wear was specific to strain and lens. Hydrophobicity of the silicone hydrogel lens surface influenced the adhesion of bacterial cells.
TI  - Incidence and risk factors for infection in oral cancer patients undergoing different treatments protocols.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances in cancer treatments have been counterbalanced by a rising number of immunosuppressed patients with a multitude of new risk factors for infection. Hence, the aim of this study was to determine risk factors, infectious pathogens in blood and oral cavity of oral cancer patients undergoing different treatment procedures. METHODS: The present prospective cohort analysis was conducted on the patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D. Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, Haryana, during the period of January 2007 to October 2009. Total 186 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity were analyzed in the study. Based on treatment procedures patients were divided into three groups, group I were under radiotherapy, group II under chemotherapy and group III were of radio chemotherapy together. Clinical isolates from blood and oral cavity were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus. The predominant gram negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia were isolated from blood of radiotherapy and oral cavity of chemotherapy treated cases respectively. The predominance of gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were observed in blood of chemotherapy, radio chemotherapy cases and oral cavity of radiotherapy, radio chemotherapy treated cases. Our study also revealed the presence of C. albicans fungi as most significant oral cavity pathogens in radiotherapy and radio chemotherapy cases. CONCLUSION: Gram positive bacteria and Gram negative were reported from the blood of all the three groups of patients. Oral mucositis played a significant role in oral cavity infection and make patients more prone to C. albicans infection.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - Synthesis of 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[1,2- a] pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as antibacterial agents.
AB  - A series of novel 3-(2-chloroethyl)-2-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one aliphatic/ aromatic/ heterocyclic amine derivatives were synthesized in good yield. The synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H-NMR, FTIR and elemental analysis. All the synthesized compounds were screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity by agar well diffusion and micro dilution method against standard strains of Gram-Positive (Bacillus Subtilis MTCC 121 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 435), and Gram-negative (Xanthomonas Campestris 7903 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 7908) bacteria. Compounds with substituted heterocyclic piperazine moiety showed good activity. In particular, compound 6i showed two fold better activity compared to the standard drug Strepyomycin sulphate.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Biofilm-forming capacity of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from ocular infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the biofilm-forming capacity of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from ocular infections. METHODS: S. epidermidis strains, S. aureus strains, and P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from patients with ocular infections between 2009 and 2011. The biofilm-forming capacity of these bacteria was examined using Congo red agar (CRA) and microtiter plate assays. The biofilm-forming related genes, icaA, of S. epidermidis and S. aureus, and pslA, of P. aeruginosa, were detected using PCR. Additionally, the morphology of biofilms was observed using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: Of the isolated S. epidermidis strains, 34.38% were CRA positive, 28.13% were adherence positive using the microtiter plate assay, and 40.63% carried the icaA gene. Of the isolated S. aureus strains, 55.56% were CRA positive, 51.90% were adherence positive, and 11.11% carried the icaA gene. None of the P. aeruginosa strains were phenotypic positive using CRA and microtiter plate assays, whereas 31.03% contained the pslA gene. There were significant differences between the three species when the biofilm-forming capacity of the strains was compared using the CRA method (P < 0.01) and the microtiter plate assay method (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic isolates of S. epidermidis and S. aureus could produce biofilms in vitro, whereas clinical strains of P. aeruginosa could not. The bacterial strains possess the genetic ability to produce biofilms, but that does not necessarily mean that biofilms will be produced. The knowledge of the process of bacterial adhesion suggests that a timely and appropriate intervention strategy be implemented in the early stages of biofilm-mediated infections.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion forces with substratum surfaces and the susceptibility of biofilms to antibiotics.
AB  - Biofilms causing biomaterial-associated infection resist antibiotic treatment and usually necessitate the replacement of infected implants. Here we relate bacterial adhesion forces and the antibiotic susceptibility of biofilms on uncoated and polymer brush-coated silicone rubber. Nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered more weakly to brush-coated silicone rubber (-0.05 +/- 0.03 to -0.51 +/- 0.62 nN) than to uncoated silicone rubber (-1.05 +/- 0.46 to -5.1 +/- 1.3 nN). Biofilms of weakly adhering organisms on polymer brush coatings remained in a planktonic state, susceptible to gentamicin, unlike biofilms formed on uncoated silicone rubber.
TI  - Characterization of the antibacterial activity and the chemical components of the volatile oil of the leaves of Rubus parvifolius L.
AB  - Rubus parvifolius L. (Rp) is a medicinal herb that possesses antibacterial activity. In this study, we extracted the volatile oil from the leaves of Rp to assess its antibacterial activity and analyze its chemical composition. A uniform distribution design was used to optimize the extraction procedure, which yielded 0.36% (w/w) of light yellowish oil from the water extract of Rp leaves. We found that the extracted oil effectively inhibited the growth of a wide range of Gram positive and negative bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Bacillus cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further analyzed the components contained in the hydro-distillated Rp volatile oil by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Twenty nine compounds were identified, including 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene (66%), 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol (10%) and 4-tert-butylbenzoic acid (2%). Our results suggest that one or multiple constituents contained in Rp volatile oil may account for its antibacterial activity.
TI  - Spectral domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography in microbial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the spectral domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SDAS-OCT) patterns in microbial keratitis (fungal and bacterial keratitis). DESIGN: Prospective, cross-sectional, observational study. METHODS: Twenty eyes of 20 patients with proven fungal and bacterial microbial keratitis, at different stages of the disease, underwent SDAS-OCT imaging. RESULTS: Eight eyes presented with proven bacterial keratitis (3 Staphylococcus Aureus, 2 Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and 3 Staphylococcus Epidermidis). Twelve eyes presented with proven fungal keratitis of Aspergillus species. Twelve different SDAS-OCT presentations of fungal and bacterial keratitis were found in this study. Our findings in fungal keratitis grasped two unique patterns of early localized and diffuse necrotic stromal cystic spaces. CONCLUSION: SDAS-OCT imaging provided a range of characteristic patterns that could be used as an additional tool in diagnosis and management of bacterial and fungal microbial keratitis.
TI  - Infections from CVC in the pediatric neoplastic patient. Single institution experience.
AB  - AIM: The present clinical study was carried out in order to evaluate in a perspective way the incidence of the infections caused by CVC, the micro-organisms mostly involved in the infectious process, the condition of aplasia in patients when blood cultures show positiveness and the incidence of removals expressed as number of performed removals/number of positive blood culture. METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by acute lymphoblastyic and myelougenous leukemia (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (17) and solid tumors (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year. The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of infection from CVC. RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations. They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%). It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals. The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete. CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated infections from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by infections from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked aplastic anemia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants.
AB  - Aerva javanica and Paeonia emodi plants extracts were studied for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (NCTC 10418), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis (NCTC 11047) and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) (NCTC 13143) and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani. Extracts were obtained by using methanol, n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fraction. The extracts of Paeonia emodi and Aerva javanica showed significant antibacterial activity but only Salmonella typhi was resistant to Aerva javanica. Moreover, the antifungal activity of Aerva javanica was very poor but the fractions of Paeonia emodi showed sufficient inhibition against fungal strains.
TI  - Frequency and antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from oral and topical medicaments from Hilla, Iraq.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The presence of microorganisms in pharmaceuticals is undesirable because they may cause spoilage of the product and may present an infection hazard to the consumers or patients. METHODOLOGY: A total of 102 samples of oral and topical non-sterile pharmaceutical products were collected at random from different drug houses and pharmacies in Iraq, to investigate the microbial contamination of these products. Bacterial isolates recovered from these medicaments were subjected to susceptibility testing against various antibiotics by disk diffusion method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards (CLSI) guidelines. RESULTS: The results revealed that the occurrence of gram-positive bacteria was in oral and topical medicaments while gram-negative bacteria were only detected in topical medicaments. More than 58% of Bacillus isolates were resistant to lincomycin and Bacillus mycoides isolates were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Staphylococcus spp. showed a relatively high resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. S. epidermidis had the highest number of multi-resistant isolates. Furthermore, 87.5% of isolated gram-negative rods showed high resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and 75% of them were highly resistant to erythromycin. One isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant among all gram-negative rod isolates. CONCLUSION: The high rate of resistance to antimicrobial agents of bacterial isolates recovered from oral and topical medicaments in this study may indicate a widespread antibiotic resistance among bacteria isolated from different sources, including those of anthropological and environmental origin.
TI  - Does dithiothreitol improve bacterial detection from infected prostheses? A pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sonication and scraping of infected prostheses usually are used to improve diagnosis of prosthetic infections, reducing false negatives. Chemical methods that reduce biofilms also may allow higher levels of detection. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore asked: (1) Do dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) remove bacteria from biofilm formed on prosthetic materials? (2) Is bacterial recovery affected by differing DTT and NAC concentrations and incubation times? (3) Do treatments with DTT and NAC detach the same amounts of bacteria from biofilm on prosthetic materials as sonication and scraping? (4) Are these methods reproducible? METHODS: We treated polyethylene and titanium discs covered by biofilm formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus with DTT or NAC solutions at different concentrations for different times. We compared colony counts of S aureus, P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli after treatment with NAC, DTT, sonication and scraping. We determined colony counts after treatment of biofilm formed by one strain of S aureus and one of P aeruginosa on five discs of each material analyzed on the same day and on five discs analyzed on five consecutive days. RESULTS: Mean colony counts (LogCFU/mL) obtained after treatment with 1 g/L DTT for 15 minutes (5.3) were similar to those after sonication (4.9) and greater than those obtaining by scraping (3.4) and treatment with 2 g/L NAC for 30 minutes (1.9). DTT and sonication showed good reproducibility. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our data suggest that treatment of prostheses with DTT may be a reasonable alternative to sonication to improve detection of biofilm-associated bacteria and supplement conventional laboratory culturing techniques for diagnosing periprosthetic infections.
TI  - Assessment of microbial diversity in biofilms recovered from endotracheal tubes using culture dependent and independent approaches.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection in mechanically ventilated patients. Biofilm formation is one of the mechanisms through which the endotracheal tube (ET) facilitates bacterial contamination of the lower airways. In the present study, we analyzed the composition of the ET biofilm flora by means of culture dependent and culture independent (16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and pyrosequencing) approaches. Overall, the microbial diversity was high and members of different phylogenetic lineages were detected (Actinobacteria, beta-Proteobacteria, Candida spp., Clostridia, epsilon-Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria). Culture dependent analysis, based on the use of selective growth media and conventional microbiological tests, resulted in the identification of typical aerobic nosocomial pathogens which are known to play a role in the development of VAP, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other opportunistic pathogens were also identified, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and Kocuria varians. In general, there was little correlation between the results obtained by sequencing 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and by cultivation. Pyrosequencing of PCR amplified 16 S rRNA genes of four selected samples resulted in the identification of a much wider variety of bacteria. The results from the pyrosequencing analysis suggest that these four samples were dominated by members of the normal oral flora such as Prevotella spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and lactic acid bacteria. A combination of methods is recommended to obtain a complete picture of the microbial diversity of the ET biofilm.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2010].
AB  - We investigated antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against 164 isolates (41 Escherichia coli, 16 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 21 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 14 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 18 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 47 Staphylococcus epidermidis) from blood of the patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January and October in 2010. Meropenem showed the potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially and it maintained good broad spectrum antimicrobial activity including resistant strains through 13 years since when we started the investigation. These results indicated the validity of choosing meropenem as a first line antimicrobial agent for serious infectious diseases.
TI  - [Advances in the study of synergistic effect of anti-biofilm agents].
AB  - Biofilms are communities of surface-associated bacteria or fungi embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric matrix that are notoriously difficult to be eradicated and are sources of many recalcitrant infections. Treatment for biofilm infection with any individual drug is always less effective, while the combinations of different types of drugs are superior to monotherapy concerning the removing of biofilms. This paper focus on research progress in recent years for synergistic effect of drugs in combination against biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans.
TI  - Anti-Helicobacter pylori activity of the methanolic extract of Geum iranicum and  its main compounds.
AB  - Geum iranicum Khatamsaz, belonging to the Rosaceae family, is an endemic plant of Iran. The methanol extract of the roots of this plant showed significant activity against one of the clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori which was resistant to metronidazole. The aim of this study was the isolation and evaluation of the major compounds of G. iranicum effective against H. pylori. The compounds were isolated using various chromatographic methods and identified by spectroscopic data (1H and 13C NMR, HMQC, HMBC, EI-MS). An antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed employing the disk diffusion method against clinical isolates of H. pylori and a micro dilution method against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; additionally the inhibition zone diameters (IZD) and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were recorded. Nine compounds were isolated: two triterpenoids, uvaol and niga-ichigoside F1, three sterols, beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosteryl acetate, and beta-sitosteryl linoleate, one phenyl propanoid, eugenol, one phenolic glycoside, gein, one flavanol, (+)-catechin, and sucrose. The aqueous fraction, obtained by partitioning the MeOH extract with water and chloroform, was the most effective fraction of the extract against all clinical isolates of H. pylori. Further investigation of the isolated compounds showed that eugenol was effective against H. pylori but gein, diglycosidic eugenol, did not exhibit any activity against H. pylori. The subfraction D4 was the effective fraction which contained tannins. It appeared that tannins were probably the active compounds responsible for the anti-H. pylori activity of G. iranicum. The aqueous fraction showed a moderate inhibitory activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC values indicated that Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis are more susceptible than Gram-neagative bacteria including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - A rat model of central venous catheter to study establishment of long-term bacterial biofilm and related acute and chronic infections.
AB  - Formation of resilient biofilms on medical devices colonized by pathogenic microorganisms is a major cause of health-care associated infection. While in vitro biofilm analyses led to promising anti-biofilm approaches, little is known about their translation to in vivo situations and on host contribution to the in vivo dynamics of infections on medical devices. Here we have developed an in vivo model of long-term bacterial biofilm infections in a pediatric totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) surgically placed in adult rats. Using non-invasive and quantitative bioluminescence, we studied TIVAP contamination by clinically relevant pathogens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and we demonstrated that TIVAP bacterial populations display typical biofilm phenotypes. In our study, we showed that immunocompetent rats were able to control the colonization and clear the bloodstream infection except for up to 30% that suffered systemic infection and death whereas none of the immunosuppressed rats survived the infection. Besides, we mimicked some clinically relevant TIVAP associated complications such as port-pocket infection and hematogenous route of colonization. Finally, by assessing an optimized antibiotic lock therapy, we established that our in vivo model enables to assess innovative therapeutic strategies against bacterial biofilm infections.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Childhood microbial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate risk factors for pediatric microbial keratitis and to describe the clinical picture, microbial spectrum, treatment modalities, posttreatment sequelae, and visual outcome in cases with pediatric microbial keratitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of microbial keratitis that occurred in children 16 years or younger who had an initial examination between January 2000 and December 2010 at a tertiary referral eye hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were identified. A retrospective review of medical records was conducted using a computer-based diagnosis code. Demographic data, predisposing factors, clinical course, microbial culture results, and visual outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes were included in this study. Predisposing factors were identified in 63 eyes (92.6%). All patients had unilateral microbial keratitis. The mean+/-SD age was 4.5 +/- 4.8 years and 57.4% were male. Trauma was the leading cause [27 eyes (39.7%)], followed by systemic diseases [14 eyes (20.6%)], contact lens wear [11 eyes (16.1%)], and ocular diseases [11 eyes (16.1%)]. Corneal scraping was performed in all cases. Five patients needed general anesthesia to carry out the corneal scraping. Thirty-four (50.0%) eyes showed positive cultures. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 67.8% and gram-negative bacteria for 38.2% of isolates. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated organism [8 eyes (25.8%)], followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis [7 eyes (22.7%)]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated gram-negative [6 eyes (17.6%)] organism. One eye had corneal perforation and required surgical intervention. Forty-five of 68 eyes (66.2%) had a best-corrected visual acuity evaluation at the last follow-up and 28 eyes (62.2%) of them had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better. CONCLUSION: Children with suspected microbial keratitis require comprehensive evaluation and management. Early recognition, identifying the predisposing factors and etiological microbial organisms, and instituting appropriate treatment measures have a crucial role in outcome. Ocular trauma was the leading cause of childhood microbial keratitis in our study.
TI  - Bioguided Fractionation Shows Cassia alata Extract to Inhibit Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Growth and Biofilm Formation.
AB  - Plant extracts have a long history to be used in folk medicine. Cassia alata extracts are known to exert antibacterial activity but details on compounds and mechanism of action remain poorly explored. We purified and concentrated the aqueous leaf extract of C. alata by reverse phase-solid phase extraction and screened the resulting CaRP extract for antimicrobial activity. CaRP extract exhibited antimicrobial activity for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, and Bacillus subtilis. CaRP also inhibited biofilm formation of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa. Several bacterial growth-inhibiting compounds were detected when CaRP extract was fractionated by TLC chromatography coupled to bioautography agar overlay technique. HPLC chromatography of CaRP extract yielded 20 subfractions that were tested by bioautography for antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Five bioactive fractions were detected and chemically characterized, using high-resolution mass spectrometry (qTOF-MS/MS). Six compounds from four fractions could be characterized as kaempferol, kaempferol-O-diglucoside, kaempferol-O-glucoside, quercetin-O-glucoside, rhein, and danthron. In the Salmonella/microsome assay CaRP showed weak mutagenicity (MI < 3) only in strain TA98, pointing to a frameshift mutation activity. These results indicate that C. alata leaf extract contains a minimum of 7 compounds with antimicrobial activity and that these together or as single substance are active in preventing formation of bacterial biofilm, indicating potential for therapeutic applications.
TI  - Electrospun zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) for nonadherent, superabsorbent, and antimicrobial wound dressing applications.
AB  - Zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) has been well studied for its superhydrophilic and ultralow biofouling properties, making it a promising material for superabsorbent and nonadherent wound dressings. Electrospinning provides multiple desirable features for wound dressings, including high absorptivity due to high surface-area-to-volume ratio, high gas permeation, and conformability to contour of the wound bed. The goal of this work is to develop a fibrous membrane of PSBMA via electrospinning and evaluate its properties related to wound dressing applications. Being superhydrophilic, PSBMA fibers fabricated by a conventional electrospinning method would readily dissolve in water, whereas if cross-linker is added, the formation of hydrogel would prevent electrospinning. A three-step polymerization-electrospinning-photo-cross-linking process was developed in this work to fabricate the cross-linked electrospun PSBMA fibrous membrane. Such electrospun membrane was stable in water and exhibited high water absorption of 353% (w/w), whereas the PSBMA hydrogel only absorbed 81% water. The electrospun membrane showed strong resistance to protein adsorption and cell attachment. Bacterial adhesion studies using Gram negative P. aeruginosa and Gram positive S. epidermidis showed that the PSBMA electrospun membrane was also highly resistant to bacterial adhesion. The Ag(+)-impregnated electrospun PSBMA membrane was shown microbicidal, against both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa. Such electrospun PSBMA membrane is ideal for a novel type of nonadherent, superabsorbent, and antimicrobial wound dressing. The superior water absorption aids in fluid removal from highly exudating wounds while keeping the wound hydrated to support healing. Because of the resistance to protein, cell, and bacterial adhesion, the dressing removal will neither cause patients' pain nor disturb the newly formed tissues. The dressing also prevents the attachment of environmental bacteria and offers broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It is the first work to develop the water-stable electrospun PSBMA membrane, which has great potential for wound dressing and other applications.
TI  - Prokaryotic selectivity and LPS-neutralizing activity of short antimicrobial peptides designed from the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37.
AB  - To develop novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (LPS)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin AMP, LL-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on IG-19 (residues 13-31 of LL-37) were synthesized. Among the IG-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower LPS-neutralizing activity compared to parental LL-37. The analogs, a5, a6, a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed LPS-neutralizing activity comparable to that of LL-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. These results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of LPS-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. Furthermore, to increase LPS-neutralizing activity of the analog a4 without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized Trp-substituted analogs (a4-W1 and a4-W2), in which Phe(5) or Phe(15) of a4 is replaced by Trp. Despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-W2 displayed much higher LPS-neutralizing activity compared to a4-W1. When compared with parental LL-37, a4-W2 showed retained LPS-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. These results suggest that the effective site for Trp-substitution when designing novel AMPs with higher LPS-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. Taken together, the analog a4-W2 can serve as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.
TI  - The Design and Construction of K11: A Novel alpha-Helical Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides comprise a class of broad-spectrum agents that are used against pathogens. We designed a series of antimicrobial peptides, CP-P (KWKSFIKKLTSKFLHLAKKF) and its derivatives, and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHCs) for human erythrocytes, and the Therapeutic Index (MHC/MIC ratio). We selected the derivative peptide K11, which had the highest therapeutic index (320) among the tested peptides, to determine the MICs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 22 clinical isolates including Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. K11 exhibited low MICs (less than 10 mug/mL) and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, these results indicate that K11 is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further studies.
TI  - Universal surface-initiated polymerization of antifouling zwitterionic brushes using a mussel-mimetic peptide initiator.
AB  - We report a universal method for the surface-initated polymerization (SIP) of an  antifouling polymer brush on various classes of surfaces, including noble metals, metal oxides, and inert polymers. Inspired by the versatility of mussel adhesive proteins, we synthesized a novel bifunctional tripeptide bromide (BrYKY) that combines atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) initiating alkyl bromide with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and lysine. The simple dip-coating of substrates with variable wetting properties and compositions, including Teflon, in a BrYKY solution at pH 8.5 led to the formation of a thin film of cross-linked BrYKY. Subsequently, we showed that the BrYKY layer initiated the ATRP of a zwitterionic monomer, sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), on all substrates, resulting in high-density antifouling pSBMA brushes. Both BrYKY deposition and pSBMA grafting were unambiguously confirmed by ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and goniometry. All substrates that were coated with BrYKY/pSBMA dramatically reduced bacterial adhesion for 24 h and also resisted mammalian cell adhesion for at least 4 months, demonstrating the long-term stability of the BrYKY anchoring and antifouling properties of pSBMA. The use of BrYKY as a primer and polymerization initiator has the potential to be widely employed in surface-grafted polymer brush modifications for biomedical and other applications.
TI  - Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of the methanol extract and compounds from Polygonum limbatum.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the antimicrobial activity and the  cytotoxicity of the methanol extract (PLA) as well as fractions (PLA1-4) and compounds [cardamomin (1), (+/-)-polygohomoisoflavanone (2), (S)-(-)-pinostrobin (3), 2',4'-dihydroxy-3',6'-dimethoxychalcone (4), (2S)-(-)-5-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxyflavanone (5), and (2S)-(-)-5,7-dimethoxyflavanone (6)] obtained from leaves of Polygonum limbatum. The microbroth dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the samples against 11 microbial strains including Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), S.epidermidis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. The sulphorhodamine B cell growth inhibition assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of the above samples on lung A549 adenocarcinoma, breast carcinoma MCF-7, prostate carcinoma PC-3, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and the acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. The results of the MIC determination indicated that, apart from fraction PLA3, all other fractions as well as PLA and compound 3 were selectively active. MIC values were noted on 100 % of the 11 tested microorganisms for fraction PLA3, 72.7 % for PLA, fraction PLA2, and compound 4, 63.6 % for PLA1, and 54.5 % for fraction PLA4. The results of the cytotoxicity assay revealed that, except for A459 cells, more than 50 % inhibition of the proliferation was obtained with each of the tested samples on at least one of the four other cell lines. IC(5)(0) values below 4 microg/mL were obtained with 1 and 4 on THP-1 cells. The overall results of the present study provided baseline information for the possible use of Polygonum limbatum as well as some of the isolated compounds for the control of cancer diseases and mostly leukemia.
TI  - [Risk factors for infections of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci in diabetic foot patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the distribution patterns of pathogens isolated from the patients with diabetic foot ulcers and explore the risk factors for infections of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE). METHODS: A total of 388 diabetic-foot patients hospitalized at Tianjin Metabolic Diseases Hospital between January 2008 and June 2010 were recruited. The distribution profiles of pathogens isolated from diabetic foot ulcers were summarized. The patients with S. aureus infections were divided into MRSA and MSSA groups while those with S. epidermidis infections into MRSE and MSSE groups. The clinical features of these patients were compared between all groups. Logistic regression was employed to identify the risk factors for the MRSA/MRSE infections. RESULTS: A total of 362 pathogens were isolated from them. And the Gram-positive bacteria were the most predominant (57.2%, 207/362), followed by Gram-negative bacilli (39.2%, 142/362) and true fungi (3.6%, 13/362). The three most frequently isolated pathogens were S. aureus (27.1%), S. epidermidis (18.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%). Statistically significant differences existed in antibiotic usage in 6 months prior to hospitalization, course of ulcer, ulcer size, deep ulcer, osteomyelitis, hypertension, anemia, hypoproteinemia and erythrocyte sedimentation rate between the patients infected with MRSA and MSSA (P < 0.05). The MRSE infection was correlated with recurrent ulcer, osteomyelitis, hypoproteinemia, HbA1c and lower total serum protein (P < 0.05). Multiple Logistic regression analysis revealed that antibiotic usage in 6 months prior to hospitalization, long course of ulcer, osteomyelitis, hypertension and hypoproteinemia were risk factors for the MRSA infection. And HbA1c was a risk factor for the MRSE infection. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the Gram-positive cocci are the main pathogens isolated from diabetic foot ulcers. And S. aureus and S. epidermidis are the most frequently isolated pathogens. Antibiotic usage in 6 months prior to hospitalization, long course of ulcer, osteomyelitis, hypertension and hypoproteinemia are risk factors for the MRSA infection. And HbA1c is a risk factor for the MRSE infection.
TI  - Adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa onto nanohydroxyapatite as a bone regeneration material.
AB  - In orthopedics due to the enormous number of surgical procedures involving invasive implant biomaterials, infections have a huge impact in terms of morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. In this study the initial adhesion of several strains namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to nanohydroxyapatite, previously heat-treated at 725 degrees C and 1000 degrees C was assessed. Adherent cells were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy and as colony forming units after being released by sonication. The wettability and roughness of samples surfaces were assessed by contact angle measurements and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Nanohydroxyapatite heat-treated at 1000 degrees C appeared to be more resistant to bacterial adhesion, over time, in five of the six tested strains while the clinical strains isolated from orthopedic infections presented superior ability to adhere, as well as better capacity to produce slime. The increase in materials sintering temperature resulted in increased hydrophobicity and roughness; however, other surface features such as the decrease in surface area and on porosity as well as the decrease on zeta potential may be the aspects that contributed to a lower bacterial adhesion on the materials sintered at 1000 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV: role of the three Aib residues on conformation and bioactivity.
AB  - The lipopeptaibol trichogin GA IV is a natural, non-ribosomally synthesized, antimicrobial peptide remarkably resistant to the action of hydrolytic enzymes. This feature may be connected to the multiple presence in its sequence of the non-coded residue alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib), which is known to be responsible for the adoption of particularly stable helical structures already at the level of short peptides. To investigate the role of Aib residues on the 3D-structure and bioactivity of trichogin GA IV, we synthesized and fully characterized four analogs where one or two Aib residues are replaced by L-Leu. Our extensive conformational studies (including an X-ray diffraction analysis) and biological assays performed on these analogs showed that the Aib to L-Leu replacements do not affect the resistance to proteolysis, but modulate the bioactivity of trichogin GA IV in a 3D-structure related manner.
TI  - The impact of the types of microorganisms isolated from blood and wounds on the results of treatment in burn patients with sepsis.
AB  - Despite development of combustiology, infections continue to be the most important cause of death among patients with burns. Sepsis is the most severe clinical presentation of infection in patients after thermal injuries who require immediate treatment. Early diagnosis and proper treatment of sepsis are important in the clinical management that is often hampered for multiple reasons, e.g. impaired patient immunity, problems with microorganisms with multi-antibacterial drug resistance. The aim of the study was to assess effect of type of a microorganism isolated from blood and wound on results of treatment of sepsis in patients with burns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Effect of type of microorganisms isolated from blood and wound on the result of treatment of sepsis was studied in 338 patients hospitalized immediately after an injury in Centre for Burn Treatment in Siemianowice Slaskie in years 2003 - 2004 (at the age of 18 - 96 years, 66 women and 272 men). Clinical symptoms of generalized infection were found in all study subjects. The study group was divided into two subgroups: cured patients and patients who died of sepsis. The following parameters were assessed in both subgroups: type of microorganism isolated from blood, type of microorganism isolated from wound as well as occurrence of the same and different infections of blood and burn wound. RESULTS: positive blood cultures were found in 165 patients (48.8%), 106 (64.2%) were cured, 59 (35.8%) died. The most commonly isolated microorganisms in cured patients were Gram(+) Staphylococcus epidermidis MRSE (19.81%) and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (18.87%). Gram(-) intestinal rods were least commonly isolated from this group. The most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood of patients who were to die, included non-fermenting Gram(-) rods Acinetobacter baumannii (35.59%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.03%). Mixed bacterial flora was found in the blood of 22.03% patients. Among patients who were to die, the same microorganisms were found in the blood and in the wound in 32.2% of patients, while this rate was 17.92 in cured patients. The most commonly found bacteria in the blood and burn wound in the cured patients included Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (31.58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.05%). In the group of patients who were to die, the most common bacteria isolated simultaneously from the blood and burn wound included Acinetobacter baumannii (47.37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.84%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The patients with thermal injuries are at higher risk of death in the event of sepsis caused by Gram(-) bacteria versus Gram(+) bacteria. 2. Infection of blood and burn wound caused by the same bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanni increases the risk of death due to sepsis in patients with burns following thermal injuries.
TI  - Evaluation of the wound healing potential of Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Wedelia trilobata (L.) Hitchc (Asteraceae) leaves are used in the treatment of wounds by traditional healers. Despite the use of this plant in wound healing, there is a scarcity of scientific data to support its therapeutic application. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the wound healing potential of Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves commonly employed by traditional healers and to clarify its traditional use in a scientific investigation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ethanolic extract of Wedelia trilobata leaves was subjected to column chromatography. Hexane, ethyl acetate (WEA) and chloroform:methanol (50:50) (WCM) fractions were obtained. The fractions were tested using relevant in vitro wound healing assays. Antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH assay. The fibroblast proliferation, oxidative stress using hydrogen peroxide, an in vitro scratch assay, and increasing collagen content was determined using fibroblast L929. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: WEA (3 mug/mL) promoted fibroblast L929 survivability up to more than 90% before and more than 85% after hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative stress. WEA (3 mug/mL) induced a 70% migration rate in the in vitro scratch assay and the collagen content was increased to 261 mug/mL compared to the control (57.5 mug/mL). WCM exhibited a scavenging activity for DPPH with an IC(50) value of 179.5 mug/mL comparable to BHT (139.3 mug/mL). WEA was active against gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis with MIC values of 62.5 and 31.25 mug/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION: These scientific findings of wound healing activity supports the traditional claims for Wedelia trilobata (L.) leaves. The WEA displayed antibacterial and fibroblast stimulatory activities while WCM exhibited antioxidant to indicate its potential wound healing properties. However further studies to isolate the antibacterial, antioxidant and fibroblast stimulatory compounds that contribute to the wound healing properties of this plant are needed.
TI  - Propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF(R)), an innovative chemically and biologically reproducible pharmaceutical compound for treating wounds.
AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a formulation, containing the propolis standardized extract (EPP-AF((R))), which can assist in the healing of skin lesions. To achieve this objective the antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the propolis extract was determined. The final product was subjected to in vitro and in vivo pre-clinical evaluation. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine the antimicrobial activity of the extracts and formulations against the microorganisms most commonly found in burns, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Wistar rats with puncture wounded skin were used to evaluate the wound healing properties of propolis. The results of chemical and biological characterization demonstrated the batch-to-batch reproducibility of the standardized extract which is an unprecedented result. The antimicrobial and wound healing activity of the pharmaceutical studied showed the best results when samples contain 3.6% propolis, suggesting that this is the most promising composition.
TI  - Studies on DNA binding behaviour of biologically active transition metal complexes of new tetradentate N2O2 donor Schiff bases: inhibitory activity against bacteria.
AB  - A series of Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) complexes of the type ML have been synthesized with Schiff bases derived from o-acetoacetotoluidide, 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and o-phenylenediamine/1,4-diaminobutane. The complexes are insoluble in common organic solvents but soluble in DMF and DMSO. The measured molar conductance values in DMSO indicate that the complexes are non-electrolytic in nature. All the six metal complexes have been fully characterized with the help of elemental analyses, molecular weights, molar conductance values, magnetic moments and spectroscopic data. The analytical data helped to elucidate the structure of the metal complexes. The Schiff bases are found to act as tetradentate ligands using N(2)O(2) donor set of atoms leading to a square-planar geometry for the complexes around all the metal ions. The binding properties of metal complexes with DNA were investigated by absorption spectra, viscosity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Detailed analysis reveals that the metal complexes intercalate into the DNA base stack as intercalators. All the metal complexes cleave the pUC19 DNA in presence of H(2)O(2.) The Schiff bases and their complexes have been screened for their antibacterial activity against five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) by disk diffusion method. All the metal complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Culturable gut microbiota diversity in zebrafish.
AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is an increasingly used laboratory animal model in basic biology and biomedicine, novel drug development, and toxicology. The wide use has increased the demand for optimized husbandry protocols to ensure animal health care and welfare. The knowledge about the correlation between culturable zebrafish intestinal microbiota and health in relation to environmental factors and management procedures is very limited. A semi-quantitative level of growth of individual types of bacteria was determined and associated with sampling points. A total of 72 TAB line zebrafish from four laboratories (Labs A-D) in the Zebrafish Network Norway were used. Diagnostic was based on traditional bacterial culture methods and biochemical characterization using commercial kits, followed by 16S rDNA gene sequencing from pure subcultures. Also selected Gram-negative isolates were analyzed for antibiotic susceptibility to 8 different antibiotics. A total of 13 morphologically different bacterial species were the most prevalent: Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Photobacterium damselae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas luteola, Comamonas testosteroni, Ochrobactrum anthropi, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis, and Staphylococcus warneri. Only Lab B had significantly higher levels of total bacterial growth (OR=2.03), whereas numbers from Lab C (OR=1.01) and Lab D (OR=1.12) were found to be similar to the baseline Lab A. Sexually immature individuals had a significantly higher level of harvested total bacterial growth than mature fish (OR=0.82), no statistically significant differences were found between male and female fish (OR=1.01), and the posterior intestinal segment demonstrated a higher degree of culturable bacteria than the anterior segment (OR=4.1). Multiple antibiotic (>3) resistance was observed in 17% of the strains. We propose that a rapid conventional diagnostic bacteriological assay on the culturable microbiota profiles can be designed and used as quality measure of the husbandry routines of a zebrafish facility to ensure a bacterial standard safeguarding the zebrafish health and welfare.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of nanofiber poly(caprolactone) tissue scaffolds releasing  rifampicin.
AB  - This study quantified the antibiotic release kinetics and subsequent bactericidal efficacy of rifampicin (RIF) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria under in vitro static conditions. Antibiotic-loaded scaffolds were fabricated by electrospinning poly(caprolactone) (PCL) with 10% or 20% (w/w) RIF. Scaffold fiber diameter and RIF loading were characterized, and RIF release kinetics were measured. RIF-releasing and RIF-free scaffolds were inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the suspended concentration live and dead bacteria were determined by fluorescent microscopy. Adherent bacteria and biofilm formation were examined using scanning electron microscopy. Mean fiber diameters were 557 +/- 399 nm for RIF-free, 402 +/- 225 nm for 10% RIF, and 665 +/- 402 nm for 20% RIF scaffolds. RIF release kinetics exhibited a short-burst release during the first hour, followed by a 7 h, zero-order release during which both RIF scaffolds released ~50% of their initial RIF mass loading. P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis suspended cell populations proliferated in accordance with logarithmic growth models when exposed to control scaffolds; however both RIF-containing scaffolds completely inhibited bacterial growth in suspension and, subsequently, prevented biofilm formation within the scaffolds through the first 6 h.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Ultralow fouling polyacrylamide on gold surfaces via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization.
AB  - In this work, polyacrylamide is investigated as an ultralow fouling surface coating to highly resist protein adsorption, cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment. Polyacrylamide was grafted on gold surfaces via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Protein adsorption from a wide range of biological media, including single protein solutions of fibrinogen, bovine serum albumin, and lysozyme, dilute and undiluted human blood serum, and dilute and undiluted human blood plasma, was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Dependence of the protein resistance on polyacrylamide film thickness was examined. With the optimal film thickness, the adsorption amount of all three single proteins on polyacrylamide-grafted surfaces was <3 pg/mm(2), close to the detection limit of SPR. The average nonspecific adsorptions from 10% plasma, 10% serum, 100% plasma, and 100% serum onto the polyacrylamide-grafted surfaces were 5, 6.5, 17, and 28 pg/mm(2), respectively, comparable (if not better) than the adsorption levels on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) surfaces, the best antifouling materials known to date. The polyacrylamide-grafted surfaces were also shown strongly resistant to adhesion from bovine aortic endothelial cells and two bacterial species, Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis ( S. epidermidis ) and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ). Strong hydrogen bond with water is considered the key attribute for the ultralow fouling properties of polyacrylamide. This is the first work to graft gold surfaces with polyacrylamide brushes via ATRP to achieve ultralow fouling surfaces, demonstrating that polyacrylamide is a promising alternative to traditional PEG-based antifouling materials.
TI  - Colored cosmetic contact lenses: an unsafe trend in the younger generation.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the microbiological profile and evaluate the clinical course and outcomes in patients who developed severe infectious keratitis after colored cosmetic contact lens wear. METHODS: This case series includes 13 patients who developed severe infectious keratitis after colored cosmetic contact lens wear. A detailed history regarding contact lens availability and storage and handling techniques was taken. All patients underwent standard diagnostic microbiological evaluation followed by culture-guided topical antimicrobial therapy. RESULTS: Of 13 patients, 8 were male and 5 were female, with mean age at presentation of 19 +/- 3.8 years. All patients were emmetropic, and lenses were worn solely for cosmetic purposes. Seven lenses were dispensed without prescription or fitting from an unlicensed optical shop, 5 patients had shared lenses with friends/relatives, and 1 patient obtained the lens from the garbage. None of the patients followed the recommended contact lens handling and storage techniques. The causative microorganisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54%), Staphylococcus aureus (25%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), with 1 case of viral keratitis. In 62% of cases, ulcer size was >/=5 x 5 mm and posttreatment corrected visual acuity was 6/24 or less. All patients responded well to topical antimicrobials, and none required surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Over-the-counter use of decorative lenses as a cosmetic aid is rapidly increasing. Easy and unmonitored availability of these cosmetic lenses is followed by severe sight-threatening complications in young emmetropic individuals.
TI  - Mussel-inspired silver-releasing antibacterial hydrogels.
AB  - A silver-releasing antibacterial hydrogel was developed that simultaneously allowed for silver nanoparticle formation and gel curing. Water-soluble polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers were synthesized that contain reactive catechol moieties, inspired by mussel adhesive proteins, where the catechol containing amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) plays an important role in the ability of the mussel to adhere to almost any surface in an aqueous environment. We utilized silver nitrate to oxidize polymer catechols, leading to covalent cross-linking and hydrogel formation with simultaneous reduction of Ag(I). Silver release was sustained for periods of at least two weeks in PBS solution. Hydrogels were found to inhibit bacterial growth, consistent with the well-known antibacterial properties of silver, while not significantly affecting mammalian cell viability. In addition, thin hydrogel films were found to resist bacterial and mammalian cell attachment, consistent with the antifouling properties of PEG. We believe these materials have a strong potential for antibacterial biomaterial coatings and tissue adhesives, due to the material-independent adhesive properties of catechols.
TI  - Determination of antimicrobial activity and resistance to oxidation of moringa peregrina seed oil.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the oil extracted with n-hexane from the seeds of Moringa peregrina was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata. The oil proved effective against all of the tested microorganisms. Standard antibiotics (netilmycin, 5-flucytocine, intraconazole and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid) were used for comparison. The resistance to oxidation of the extracted seed oil was also determined.
TI  - Testing of the Safety and the Effectiveness of Using SamjeongPharmacopuncture Solution as Eye drops.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This experimental study was designed to investigate the safety and the effectiveness of Samjeong pharmacopuncture solution (SPS) manufactured by using a the lowtemperature extract on process. METHODS: To identify the safety and the effectiveness of using SPS as eye drops, we performed applied eye irritation tests on rabbits and antibacterial tests for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Candida albicans. The eye irritation test was performed according to the toxicity testing regulation of the Korea Food & Drug Administration (2009. 8. 24, KFDA 2009-116). After SPS had been applied on the left eye of the rabbits, eye irritation in the cornea, iris and conjunctiva was observed on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 7th day. After SPS had been dropped on bacterial species that cause keratitis, the minimum inhibition concentration and the size of the inhibition zone were measured. The anti-bacterial potency was also measured by taking the size of inhibition zone. RESULTS: After SPS had been administered on the left eye of the rabbits, none of nine rabbits were found to show abnormal signs or weight changes. After SPS had been administered on the left eye of the rabbits, no eye irritation in the cornea, iris and conjunctiva was observed on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 7th day. No specific response was detected in MIC for bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, and Candida albicans after SPS had been applied. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SPS is a non-toxic and non-irritant medicine that does not cause any of eye irritation in rabbits, but it has no antibacterial effects on bacterial species that are well known to cause keratitis. These results suggest that more research is required on extracts from herbal medicines for treating keratitis.
TI  - Examination of bacterial resistance to exogenous nitric oxide.
AB  - While much research has been directed to harnessing the antimicrobial properties  of exogenous NO, the possibility of bacteria developing resistance to such therapy has not been thoroughly studied. Herein, we evaluate potential NO resistance using spontaneous and serial passage mutagenesis assays. Specifically, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were systematically exposed to NO-releasing 75mol% MPTMS-TEOS nitrosothiol particles at or below minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels. In the spontaneous mutagenesis assay, bacteria that survived exposure to lethal concentrations of NO showed no increase in MIC. Similarly, no increase in MIC was observed in the serial passage mutagenesis assay after exposure of these species to sub-inhibitory concentrations of NO through 20 d.
TI  - Modulation of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens by oleanolic acid and  ursolic acid.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens is a serious problem for human and veterinary medicine, which necessitates the development of novel therapeutics and antimicrobial strategies. Some plant-derived compounds, e.g. pentacyclic triterpenoids such as oleanolic acid (OA) and ursolic acid (UA), have potential as a new class of antibacterial agents as they are active against many bacterial species, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, and specifically target the cell envelope. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of OA and UA on the susceptibility of four bacterial pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) to the beta-lactam antibiotics ampicillin (Ap) and oxacillin (Ox). Antimicrobial assays were conducted with bacteria growing in liquid suspension cultures (planktonic cells) or as biofilms. Using FICI value estimation and the time-kill method it was demonstrated that in some combinations, the tested compounds acted in synergy to lower the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and L. monocytogenes to ampicillin and oxacillin, but no synergy was observed for P. aeruginosa. These results indicate that OA and UA may be useful when administered in combination with beta-lactam antibiotics to combat bacterial infections caused by some Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Assessment of the antimicrobial activity of acellular vascular grafts.
AB  - Several studies have reported biological vascular grafts to be more resistant to  microbial infection than synthetic counterparts in vivo. Indeed, small intestinal submucosa (SIS) materials have previously been reported to be antimicrobial. The aim of this study was to assess the antimicrobial activity and the ability to resist biofilm formation of a novel acellular vascular graft and compare it to commercially available alternatives using a range of organisms: MRSA, MSSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. This was achieved using a modified disk diffusion assay and extraction of the materials into solution followed by minimum inhibitory concentration assays. To assess resistance to biofilm formation a novel biofilm assay was developed which compared the total colony forming units (CFU) recovered from each material and identification of the percentage of CFU which were loosely attached, residing within the biofilm or attached to the biomaterial. The results indicated a lack of antimicrobial activity for all materials tested, including SIS. The biological materials were more resistant to the formation of a biofilm compared to Dacron.
TI  - Evaluation of the sterility testing process of hematopoietic stem cells at Canadian Blood Services.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sterility testing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at The Canadian  Blood Services Stem Cell Laboratory is performed using BacT/ALERT aerobic (SA) culture bottles. This study was conducted to verify the efficacy of this method and to assess the use of the BacT/ALERT aerobic (BPA) and anaerobic (BPN) culture bottles for microbial testing of HSCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: HSC products, including cryopreserved apheresis peripheral blood, marrow, and cord blood and fresh cord blood, were spiked with four aerobic organisms including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, and the anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis at a target concentration of 100 colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. One to 2 mL of pre- and postspiked samples was inoculated into SA, BPA, and BPN bottles in duplicate and incubated for 5 to 10 days. The presence of the testing organisms in positive culture bottles was confirmed by plating on blood agar. RESULTS: The BacT/ALERT system detected the aerobic organisms in all HSCs in SA and BPA bottles within 34.1 hours while B. fragilis was detected only in BPN bottles within 68.6 hours. The mean recovered concentration of microorganisms in the HSC products ranged from 55 to 352 CFUs/mL with the exception of B. cereus, which was greater than 10(3) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the current sterility testing process at the Canadian Blood Services Stem Cell Laboratory detected the tested aerobic but not the anaerobic microbial contaminants in HSCs. The ability of the BacT/ALERT system using BPA and BPN bottles to detect bacterial contamination in HSCs was also demonstrated.
TI  - In vitro microbiology studies on a new peritoneal dialysis connector.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the ability of a recently developed peritoneal dialysis (PD) connector to prevent the risk of bacterial transfer to the fluid path after simulated touch and airborne contamination. METHODS: Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC1228 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 strains were used. For touch contamination, 2 muL of a standardized inoculum [1x10(8) colony-forming units (CFU) per milliliter] were deposited on top of the pin closing the fluid path of the patient connector. For airborne contamination, the patient connector was exposed for 15 seconds to a nebulized standardized inoculum. To simulate the patient peritoneum and effluent, the patient connector was pre-attached to a 2-L bag of sterile PD solution. After contamination, the patient connector was attached to the transfer set, the pin was captured, flow control was turned to simulate "patient drain" into the empty bag, and then "patient fill" using the bag pre-attached to the connector. Finally, a new pin was recaptured. The PD solution collected in the bag pre-attached to the connector was run through a 0.20-mum filter for colony counts. RESULTS: No infected connector transferred bacteria to the fluid path, regardless of the challenge procedure or the strain used. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the new PD connector may fully obviate the risk of bacterial infection, even in the presence of heavy contamination. Further studies are in progress to test our PD connector in a clinical setting.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Bacteriuria and antibiotic resistance in catheter urine specimens following radical prostatectomy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are increasing reports of infectious complications following prostate biopsy due to fluoroquinolone resistance. To determine infectious complications at catheter removal following radical prostatectomy (RP), another setting in daily urological practice where fluoroquinolone prophylaxis is frequently used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively examined urine culture results collected from 334 RP patients immediately prior to catheter removal. Patients received prophylactic antibiotics 1 day before, the day of, and for 5 days after catheter removal. Culture results were reviewed for bacterial species and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Patients with positive urine cultures resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic were switched to culture-specific antibiotic therapy and underwent follow-up culture. The frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI), complications, additional antibiotic therapy, and repeat urine cultures was determined within 60 days. RESULTS: Of the 334 patients identified, 203 (61%) had cultures with no bacterial growth, and 48 (14%) had colony counts of <1,000 bacteria or Candida albicans and received no further antibiotics. The remaining 83 (25%) had positive culture results, of which 7% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Twenty-four bacterial species were identified, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%) Escherichia coli (4%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (3%) being the most frequent. Only two (0.6%) men developed clinical symptoms consistent with UTI (i.e., suprapubic pain, fever) prior to catheter removal, and no serious complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of RP patients have positive urine cultures at the time of catheter removal, despite the administration of prophylactic fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Potentially virulent organisms are commonly cultured, and ciprofloxacin resistance is frequent. However, outcomes are favorable when culture-specific oral antibiotic therapy is initiated.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - In vivo antioxidative property, antimicrobial and wound healing activity of flower extracts of Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pyrostegia venusta (Ker Gawl) Miers. (Bignoniaceae), has been traditionally used as a remedy for treating white patches and infections on the skin (leukoderma, vitiligo). AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate wound healing and antimicrobial activity of flower extract of Pyrostegia venusta, including in vivo antioxidant activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methanolic extracts of Pyrostegia venusta flowers were studied for wound healing efficiency along with its effect on pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was assessed using excision and incision model of wound repair in Wistar rats. Healing was assessed by the rate of wound contraction, tensile strength, breaking strength, hydroxyproline and hexosamine content. Antimicrobial activity of the flower extract against twelve microorganisms was also assessed. In vivo antioxidant activity was performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. RESULTS: The results indicated that Pyrostegia venusta extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expression were also correlative with the healing pattern observed. Pyrostegia venusta extract exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Candida tropicana. During early wound healing phase TNF-alpha and IL-6 level were found to be up regulated by Pyrostegia venusta treatment. CONCLUSION: Increased wound contraction and tensile strength, augmented hydroxyproline and hexosamine content along with antioxidative activity and moderate antimicrobial activity support the early wound healing exhibited by Pyrostegia venusta flower extract. Induction in cytokine production may be one of the mechanisms involved in accelerating the wound healing by Pyrostegia venusta extract. Results suggest that Pyrostegia venusta may be useful in the tropical management of wound healing.
TI  - Prevention of vascular graft infections with antibiotic graft impregnation prior  to implantation: in vitro comparison between daptomycin, rifampin and nebacetin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the in vitro efficacy of graft impregnation with nebacetin  versus rifampin versus daptomycin against vascular graft infections caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus and nebacetin versus rifampin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. MATERIALS: Twenty-three Dacron-grafts (1 cm2) for each micro-organism were microbiologically tested and eight grafts per antibiotic underwent viability tests against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs). Fifteen grafts (5/antibiotic agent) underwent 15 min impregnation and contamination with 4 ml bacterial solution (optical density (OD (600 nm)): 0.20 +/- 0.02). After 24-h-incubation, all grafts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and underwent sonification to release viable adherent bacteria. OD (600 nm) of the solution was measured. Afterwards, six 1:10 dilution steps took place and colony-forming units (CFUs) were counted. RESULTS: Nebacetin showed comparable efficacy to daptomycin against Gram-positive bacteria. Both eradicated more efficiently S. epidermidis than rifampin (daptomycin:0, rifampin:5 +/- 7.3, nebacetin:0 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.0003). All antibiotics showed comparable antibacterial activity against S. aureus. Nebacetin was more efficient than rifampin to eradicate Gram-negative organisms (P. aeruginosa: rifampin:1308 +/- 252, nebacetin:8 +/- 8 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.01, E. coli: rifampin:294 +/- 159, nebacetin:0.2 +/- 0.5 CFU ml(-1), P = 0.001), while only rifampin was toxic against ECs (daptomycin:30.88 +/- 5.44, rifampin:5.13 +/- 5.08, nebacetin:28.50 +/- 3.82 ECs/field, P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Nebacetin showed excellent in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens representing an effective candidate for vascular graft impregnation.
TI  - Locking tunneled hemodialysis catheters with hypertonic saline (26% NaCl) and heparin to prevent catheter-related bloodstream infections and thrombosis: a randomized, prospective trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tunneled cuffed dual-lumen catheters (TCCs) are commonly used for vascular access in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is the major problem leading to morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether 26% NaCl solution has any favorable effect on the infections and thrombosis caused by HD catheters. METHODS: TCCs were locked with either 26% NaCl and heparin or standard heparin. The primer end point of the study was the CRBSI or thrombosis of the TCC. We compared the antimicrobial activity of the NaCl solutions (6.5%, 13%, 26%) with 0.9% NaCl solution by time-kill kinetic assay. All tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. RESULTS: The mean catheter survival was significantly higher in the 26% NaCl and heparin group (129.5 +/- 50.1 catheter days to 103.3 +/- 59.8, p = 0.008). CRBSI rates (10-15.4%) did not differ significantly between the two groups (p = 0.54). The hypertonic 13% NaCl solution had bactericidal effects on E. coli and P. aeruginosa, but had bacteriostatic effect on S. aureus and S. epidermidis. CONCLUSION: In this study we demonstrated that the 13% NaCl solution and more hypertonic NaCl solutions revealed potent in vitro antimicrobial properties against all checked Gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Essential oil of Myrica esculenta Buch. Ham.: composition, antimicrobial and topical anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Hydrodistilled oil obtained from the stem bark of Myrica esculenta Buch. Ham. ex  D. Don (yield 0.3%) was analysed by capillary GC and GC-MS. The volatile oil consisted mainly of n-hexadecanol (25.2%), eudesmol acetate (21.9%), palmitic acid (11.6%), cis-beta-caryophyllene (8.7%), n-pentadecanol (7.7%) and n-octadecanol (7.6%). The oil was found to be a potential antimicrobial agent against Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The essential oil exhibited significant topical anti-inflammatory activity compared to standard drug in Swiss albino mice ear.
TI  - Antioxidant, antimicrobial activities and fatty acid components of flower, leaf,  stem and seed of Hypericum scabrum.
AB  - The hexane extracts of flower, leaf, stem, and seed of Hypericum scabrum, which were collected from northwestern Iran, were obtained by extraction in a Soxhlet apparatus. The fatty acids were converted to methyl esters and determined by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) systems. The hexane extract from the flower, leaf, stem, and seed contained 39.1%, 43.2%, 29.0%, and 37.6% of omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. The other main components of the flower extract were tetracosane (12.2%) and palmitic acid (9.3%), and that of the leaf extract was palmitic acid (7.4%). The stem and seed extracts contained bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (18.7% and 35.7%), nonacosane (11.7% and 3.9%) and linoleic acid (6.5% and 6.9%) as major components. The hexane extracts of different parts from H. scabrum represent an important source of omega-3 fatty acids in several Hypericum species. The antioxidant activity of all hexane extracts was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging method. The results indicate that hexane extracts from different parts of H. scabrum possess considerable antioxidant activity. The highest radical scavenging activity was detected in seed, which had an IC50 = 165 microg/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts of those samples were determined against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), as well as three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Aspergillus niger). The bioassay showed that the oil exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity. This study reveals that the all parts of this plant are attractive sources of fatty acid components, especially the essential ones, as well as of effective natural antioxidants.
TI  - Inactivation of microorganisms within collagen gel biomatrices using pulsed electric field treatment.
AB  - Pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment was examined as a potential decontamination method for tissue engineering biomatrices by determining the susceptibility of a range of microorganisms whilst within a collagen gel. High intensity pulsed electric fields were applied to collagen gel biomatrices containing either Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae or the spores of Aspergillus niger. The results established varying degrees of microbial PEF susceptibility. When high initial cell densities (10(6)-10(7) CFU ml(-1)) were PEF treated with 100 pulses at 45 kV cm(-1), the greatest log reduction was achieved with S. cerevisiae (~6.5 log(10) CFU ml(-1)) and the lowest reduction achieved with S. epidermidis (~0.5 log(10) CFU ml(-1)). The results demonstrate that inactivation is influenced by the intrinsic properties of the microorganism treated. Further investigations are required to optimise the microbial inactivation kinetics associated with PEF treatment of collagen gel biomatrices.
TI  - An in vitro and in vivo study on the intensity of adhesion and colonization by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on originally synthesized biomaterials with different chemical composition and modified surfaces and their effect on expression of TNF-alpha, beta-defensin 2 and IL-10 in tissues.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine adhesion and colonization of bacteria on the surface of originally synthesized glass-ceramic biomaterials and their effect on inflammation reactions in tissues surrounding the implant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biomaterial discs were contaminated with bacterial suspensions of 10, 10(2), and 10(3) colony forming units (CFU)/mL (P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228), and after 2 hours of cultivation, the intensity of bacterial adhesion was determined. For in vivo tests, the samples were contaminated with 102 and 103 CFU/mL cultivated at 37 degrees C for 2 h to ensure bacterial adhesion. Contaminated biomaterial samples were implanted in the interscapular area of chinchilla rabbits for 2 and 4 weeks. The biomaterials were removed, and using plate count and sonification methods, bacterial colonization on the surface of biomaterials was determined. Moreover, the expression of TNF-alpha, beta-defensin 2, and IL-10 in the surrounding tissues was assessed by using immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa more intensively colonized biomaterials in the in vivo study as compared with S. epidermidis. Il-10 is a regulatory cytokine, which reduces the intensity of inflammatory cell activity, thus reducing nonspecific resistance of the organism. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 was not affected by short (2 and 4 weeks) biomaterial implantation. Pronounced cytokine expression in tissues around implanted biomaterials contaminated with P. aeruginosa was observed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of some Indian Ayurvedic preparations against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In Ayurveda, various herbal preparations are clinically used to prevent or cure infectious diseases. Herbal preparations such as Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna, Manjistadi churna, Sukhsarak churna, Ajmodadi churna, Shivkshar pachan churna, Mahasudarshan churna, Swadist Virechan churna and Pipramool churna were investigated by preparing their organic solvent extract for antibacterial potential against enteric bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris, respectively. In the present study, Triphala churna, Hareetaki churna, Dashmula churna were potent antibacterial agents against S. epidermidis, P. vulgaris, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. typhi. The study supports the use of these herbal preparations not only as dietary supplements but also as agents to prevent or control enteric bacterial infections.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from Hypericum spp.
AB  - Biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. New drugs are needed to combat these pathogens. Hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. However, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. The investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species Hypericum densiflorum, Hypericum ellipticum, Hypericum prolificum, and Hypericum punctatum as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. Assays were conducted against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.95 microg/mL to 7.81 microg/mL. Four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain Gram-positive strains at sub-MIC concentrations.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of different adenosine analogues.
AB  - Nucleoside analogues may represent good candidates for the discovery of new antibacterial agents, therefore, a library of adenosine analogues was assessed for their antibacterial activity, and the relationship between the structure and activity of these molecules was outlined. Antibacterial activity was evaluated against that of reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We tested 54 adenosine analogues, modified both at ribose and base moieties, including adenine and 1/3-deazaadenine derivatives substituted in the 2- and/or N(6)-positions and bearing N-9 sugar moieties, such as ribose, 2'-deoxyribose, 3'-deoxyribose, 2',3'-dideoxyribose or cycloalkyl groups like cyclopentane. The data obtained, MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations demonstrated that the presence of bulky substituents such as cycloheptyl and cyclooctyl rings on the N(6)-amino, together with a chlorine atom in the 2-position, conferred antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive group with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 mg l(-1). The intact sugar moiety seemed to be not essential for antimicrobial activity and nucleosides bearing deoxyribose or cyclopentyl groups associated with bulky substituents in N(6)-position showed good antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, N-1 proved to be non-crucial and the 2-chloro-N(6)-cyclooctyl-1-deaza-3'-deoxyadenosine and 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine compounds were among the more active in the series with an MIC of 32 mg l(-1) against Staph. aureus and Strep. pneumoniae. None of the analogues was active against the two gram-negative species tested. Hence, adenosine derivatives bearing bulky substituents in the N(6)-position may represent good lead compounds for the future discovery of a novel series of antibacterial agents.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion-resistant poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) derivative for mammalian cell cultures.
AB  - In an attempting to find new biomaterials for mammalian cell culture, PHEMA derivatives with ester side groups are synthesized by one-step polymer-analogous reaction. These polymers show excellent antifouling properties against S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa while their cytotoxicity and proliferation activity for HDF cell are on a similar level as commercially available TCPS. The interesting bioadhesion property is systematically correlated with surface properties of the PHEMA derivatives.
TI  - Extracellular DNA in biofilms.
AB  - Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. Its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, then Enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. Autolysis is the common mechanism by which eDNA is released. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. In E. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. In Staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. In S. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in S. epidermidis by the autolysin protein AtlE. In P. aeruginosa eDNA is located primarily in the stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. In S. aureus the crucial role of eDNA in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of DNase I. eDNA represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. eDNA and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the TLR family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).
TI  - Role of antibiofilm-antimicrobial agents in controlling device-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on organism viability in planktonic and biofilm phases, biofilm thickness, and extracellular polysaccharide content. METHODS: We performed time-kill curves and broth macrodilution assays of bacterial and fungal clinical isolates with varying concentrations of NAC. We also created in vitro bacterial biofilms, incubated them with NAC or control, and then stained with propidium iodide and FITC-labeled concanavalin A. We measured biofilm thickness, number of non-viable cells, and fluorescent intensity as a marker of extracellular matrix via a confocal laser scanning microscope. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. Tested organisms included methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, MRSA), S. epidermidis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and C. krusei. RESULTS: NAC 80 mg/ml was uniformly bactericidal (>99.9% reduction) against all tested bacteria with no recoverable organisms after 30 minutes of incubation, but was fungistatic against candida species. Minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of NAC ranged from 5-10 mg/ml. Biofilm thickness was significantly decreased in NAC-treated biofilms for all organisms except VRE. The number of non-viable cells in NAC-treated Gram-positive biofilms was increased (p<0.05 for MRSA and VRE). NAC-treated Gram-negative biofilms had scant cellularity and lacked complex 3-dimensional structures that were characteristic of controls. Fluorescent intensity was similar in the experimental and control arms. CONCLUSIONS: NAC is bactericidal against clinically relevant and drug-resistant bacteria and also leads to biofilm disruption. NAC has the potential for use as a novel agent for prevention or treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin exerts antimicrobial activities.
AB  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an interleukin-7-like cytokine expressed by epithelial cells and reported to be involved in allergic diseases and atopic eczema. The presence of several predicted alpha-helical regions in TSPL, a structure characterizing many classical antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), prompted us to investigate whether TSLP exerts antimicrobial activities. Recombinant human TSLP exerted antimicrobial activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Using synthetic overlapping peptide 20-mers of TSLP, it was demonstrated that the antimicrobial effect is primarily mediated by the C-terminal region of the protein. MKK34 (MKKRRKRKVTTNKCLEQVSQLQGLWRRFNRPLLK), a peptide spanning a C-terminal alpha-helical region in TSLP, showed potent antimicrobial activities, in physiological salt conditions and in the presence of human plasma. Fluorescent studies of peptide-treated bacteria, electron microscopy and liposome leakage models showed that MKK34 exerted membrane-disrupting effects comparable to those of the classical AMP LL-37. Moreover, TSLP was degraded into multiple fragments by staphylococcal V8 proteinase. One major antimicrobial degradation fragment was found to encompass the C-terminal antimicrobial region defined by the MKK34 peptide. We here describe a novel antimicrobial role for TSLP. The antimicrobial activity is primarily mediated by the C-terminal part of the protein. In combination with the previously known cytokine function of TSLP, our result indicates dual functions of the molecule and a previously unknown role in host defense.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Determination of causative agents in ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments--multicenter study of causative agents and drug sensitivity of ocular infection by the Japanese Association for Ocular Infection part I].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the causative agents of ocular infection of external adnexa and anterior segments due to selected criteria. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between September 22, 2007 and August 25, 2008, 890 bacterial strains were collected from 476 patients in 18 facilities nationwide participating in the Drug Sensitivity for Ocular Infection Study Group. Usual aerobic and anaerobic cultures, enrichment cultures, smears, and measurements of bacterial quantity were performed and the determination of causative agents was made from the results of smears and culture, the presence of polymorphonuclear cells and bacterial quantity. The selection was divided into two categories, causative agents and presumed causative agents. Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella bacilli, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were distinctively considered as specified bacteria. RESULTS: Among 890 strains, 18.8% were determined to be causative agents, and 15.1% were determined to be presumed causative agents. Among the bacteria detected in normal flora, 2.0% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.6% of Propionibacterium acnes, and 38.3% of Corynebacterium spp. were determined to be causative agents. CONCLUSION: To determine the causative agents, the results of smears and bacterial quantity should be considered together with culture results. Bacteria constituting normal flora have the potential of becoming causative agents.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity and frequency of spontaneous gentamicin-resistant mutants in bacteria related skin infections].
AB  - Gentamicin is used in an ointment form for the treatment of skin infections. To investigate the effect of gentamicin used as an ointment, the antimicrobial susceptibilities against Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from community and medical settings were studied and compared with other antibacterial agents such as fradiomycin, chloramphenicol, and bacitracin used as active ingredient for each ointment. Gentamicin showed antibacterial activities for all standard bacteria tested, but fradiomycin and chloramphenicol showed no such activities for St. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Bacitracin showed activity for St. pyogenes only. The strains of staphylococci isolated from healthy people were highly susceptible to gentamicin, while 49.3% of the isolates from the patients with skin infections were resistant to gentamicin and 96.4% of the gentamicin-resistant staphylococci carried the aminoglycoside-resistance gene aacA-aphD. The growths of all strains tested, except for two strains of P. aeruginosa, were inhibited by close below 128 microg/ml of gentamicin. Furthermore, the frequencies of spontaneous mutants resistant to gentamicin, fradiomycin, and chloramphenicol were each investigated using S. aureus, S. epidermidis, St. pyogenes, and P. aeruginosa. At doses of more than 32 microg/ml of gentamicin, no resistant mutants in any of bacteria strains tested were obtained. The concentration of gentamicin on the skin was calculated at approximately 895 microg/ml at least when the commercially used 0.1% gentamicin ointment was applied to the skin. Therefore, our study strongly indicates that the gentamicin ointment used has a potency of sufficiently inhibiting the growth of bacteria, including gentamicin-resistant strains, which cause skin infections in the community.
TI  - Exploring the DNA binding mode of transition metal based biologically active compounds.
AB  - Few novel 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes were synthesized and characterized. Their structural features and other properties were deduced from the elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility and molar conductivity as well as from mass, IR, UV-vis, (1)H NMR and EPR spectral studies. The binding of the complexes with CT-DNA was analyzed by electronic absorption spectroscopy, viscosity measurement, and cyclic voltammetry. The interaction of the metal complexes with DNA was also studied by molecular modeling with special reference to docking. The experimental and docking results revealed that the complexes have the ability of interaction with DNA of minor groove binding mode. The intrinsic binding constants (K(b)) of the complexes with CT-DNA were found out which show that they are minor groove binders. Gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complexes to cleave the pUC19 DNA in the presence of AH(2) (ascorbic acid). Moreover, the oxidative cleavage studies using distamycin revealed the minor groove binding for the newly synthesized 4-aminoantipyrine derived Schiff bases and their metal complexes. Evaluation of antibacterial activity of the complexes against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited that the complexes have potent biocidal activity than the free ligands.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the essential oil and main components of two Dracocephalum species from Iran.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of Dracocephalum polychaetum and D. surmandinum essential oils and two main components were investigated. Essential oils of the plants were analysed by GC and GC-MS. Twenty-three components were characterised in the essential oil of D. polychaetum. The oil was rich in oxygenated (73.1%) and hydrocarbon (25.0%) monoterpenes including perilla aldehyde (63.4 %) and limonene (22.1%) as the major constituents. From 25 identified compounds (97.8%) in the oil of D. surmandinum perilla aldehyde (54.3%) and limonene (30.1%) were the main constituents. The bioassays exhibited that all of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested were highly inhibited in the presence of the oils and main components investigated. The most sensitive microorganism to the oils was found to be Staphylococcus epidermidis with the lowest MIC value of 0.3 mgmL(-1). The resistant Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly inhibited by the oil of D. polychaetum with MIC value of 2.4 mgmL(-1).
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Anthemis  altissima L. var. altissima.
AB  - The essential oil obtained from the flowering parts of Anthemis altissima L. var. altissima was analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. In this study, 34 compounds representing 98.76% of the essential oil were identified. The main components were alpha-terpineol (26.42%), beta-pinene (9.23%), cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (6.30%), globulol (5.36%), n-tricosane (4.41%), terpinen-4-ol (4.08%) and 1,8 cineole (3.84%). Antibacterial activities of the essential oil and its two major components (alpha-terpineol and beta-pinene) were determined using microdilution method against both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. The essential oil showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (MICs ranged from 3.13 to 6.25 microL mL(-1)). It was found that alpha-terpineol with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the range 0.87-1.56 microL mL(-1) was a more potent antibacterial agent than beta-pinene with MIC values of the range 1.56-6.25 microL mL(-1). All of them, the essential oil, beta-pinene and alpha-terpineol, were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative ones.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected medicinal plants against multiple antibiotic resistant uropathogens: a study from Kolli Hills, Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - The increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens necessitates medicinal plants as an alternate therapy in restricting the resistant infectious organisms. In this primitive study, the antibiotic resistance of organisms isolated from urinary tract infected patients was evaluated using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) method and Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR) index values, and the MAR values was also calculated for plant extracts. The 10 common medicinal plants collected from Kolli hills, Namakkal, south India were extracted using the chloroform, methanol, acetone, ethanol and saponification procedure. The efficacy of the extracts on the uropathogens was tested by agar disc diffusion method in order to analyse the inhibitory activity of plant extract on the organisms. Azadiracta indica A. Juss., Tinospora cordifolia (Wild.) and Euphorbia hirta Linn. exhibited high inhibitory activity against most of the 11 tested organisms followed by Cassia javanica Linn. and Phyllanthus niruri Linn. The maximum zone size of 46.3 mm was exhibited by methanol extract of P. niruri Linn. against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Asparagus racemosus Willd. and Eupatorium triplinerve Vahl had the least activity against resistant pathogens. Saponified lipids of most of the plants exhibited maximum antibacterial activity. Among the tested organisms, P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most susceptible and Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloaceae, Citrobacter koseri, and Citrobacter freundii were the least inhibited by most of the extracts of medicinal plants. It is concluded that revised antibiotic policies and more importantly the development of herbal medicine as an alternative may be incorporated in urological practice.
TI  - Efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  - There is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. However, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. Infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) were reviewed regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. Growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees C. The activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the MBEC Assay. Infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at SJCRH. Heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. Ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. Heparin lock solutions containing the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. These findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - In vitro interactions between bacteria, osteoblast-like cells and macrophages in  the pathogenesis of biomaterial-associated infections.
AB  - Biomaterial-associated infections constitute a major clinical problem that is difficult to treat and often necessitates implant replacement. Pathogens can be introduced on an implant surface during surgery and compete with host cells attempting to integrate the implant. The fate of a biomaterial implant depends on the outcome of this race for the surface. Here we studied the competition between different bacterial strains and human U2OS osteoblast-like cells (ATCC HTB-94) for a poly(methylmethacrylate) surface in the absence or presence of macrophages in vitro using a peri-operative contamination model. Bacteria were seeded on the surface at a shear rate of 11 1/s prior to adhesion of U2OS cells and macrophages. Next, bacteria, U2OS cells and macrophages were allowed to grow simultaneously under low shear conditions (0.14 1/s). The outcome of the competition between bacteria and U2OS cells for the surface critically depended on bacterial virulence. In absence of macrophages, highly virulent Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa stimulated U2OS cell death within 18 h of simultaneous growth on a surface. Moreover, these strains also caused cell death despite phagocytosis of adhering bacteria in presence of murine macrophages. Thus U2OS cells are bound to loose the race for a biomaterial surface against S. aureus or P. aeruginosa, even in presence of macrophages. In contrast, low-virulent Staphylococcus epidermidis did not cause U2OS cell death even after 48 h, regardless of the absence or presence of macrophages. Clinically, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa are known to yield acute and severe biomaterial-associated infections in contrast to S. epidermidis, mostly known to cause more low-grade infection. Thus it can be concluded that the model described possesses features concurring with clinical observations and therewith has potential for further studies on the simultaneous competition for an implant surface between tissue cells and pathogenic bacteria in presence of immune system components.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Conidiogenones H and I, two new diterpenes of Cyclopiane class from a marine-derived endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum QEN-24S.
AB  - Two new tetracyclic diterpenes of the rarely reported cyclopiane class, conidiogenones H and I (1 and 2, resp.), along with five related congeners, conidiogenones B - D and F (3-5 and 6, resp.) and conidiogenol (7), were characterized from the culture extracts of Penicillium chrysogenum QEN-24S, an endophytic fungus derived from an unidentified marine red algal species of the genus Laurencia. The structures of these compounds were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. The inhibitory activity of theses diterpenes against four bacteria and one pathogen fungus was evaluated. Conidiogenone B (3) showed potent activity against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (each with a MIC value of 8 mug/ml), while conidiogenol (7) showed obvious activity against P. fluorescens and S. epidermidis (each with a MIC value of 16 mug/ml). This is the first report on antimicrobial activity of cyclopiane diterpenes.
TI  - Biocompatibility evaluation of a new hydrogel dressing based on polyvinylpyrrolidone/polyethylene glycol.
AB  - The composition of the dressings is based on polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and agar. The electron beam irradiation technique has been used to prepare hydrogel wound dressings. The in vitro biocompatibility of the hydrogel was investigated by check samples (hydrocolloid Comfeel), antibacterial test (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia Coli k12), anti fungal test (Candida Albicans) and cytotoxicity test (Fibroblast L929). Results have shown cell attachment characteristics and nontoxicity of all samples. Antibacterial testing also showed that the antibacterial effect of the hydrogel sample to the check sample increased to 30%. Also, investigation of antifungal analysis did not show any trace of fungi growth on the surface of the hydrogel, whereas antifungal effect did not observe on the surface of the check sample. Finally, this hydrogel sample showed a good in vitro biocompatibility.
TI  - [Urinary tract infection in patient after brain injury].
AB  - INTRUDUCTION: One of the most important problems in treating patients after head  injury is urinary complication. The first place take urinary infections, which disturb rehabilitation process. Clean intermittent catherization, bladder training and good care do not preserve infection. The purpose of our study was to present the frequency of urinary infections and main pathogens involved in these infections among patients treated in The Department of Rehabilitation after head injury. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We gathered microbiological tests and observations from 398 patients (from 2 to 73 years old) after head injury treated in years 2003-2005. Some of them survived head injury and some of them had also multiorgan injury. RESULTS: In 133 of them we found bladder and urethra infections, vesical calculus in 11 cases. In one case we found prostatic abscessus and in one case urethroscrotal fistula. Each patient had microbiological test of urine after he was admitted to the Department. If the test was positive he had pharmacological treatment. In 157 urinary infections we selected Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Candida albicans was represented not so often. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequent pathogens were: Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli. Most of patients had positive microbiological tests at the admittance to our Department. These complications extend the rehabilitation process and generate high costs. It is necessary to create standards of care of neuropathic bladder in patients after head injury.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Rosemary.
AB  - The composition of the essential oil of Rosemary was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 22 components, which constitute 97.41% of the oil, were identified. The major constituents were 1,8-Cineole (26.54%) and alpha-Pinene (20.14%). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) and time-kill dynamic processes against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis), three Gram-negative bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) were determined for the oil, 1,8-Cineole and alpha-Pinene. The oil showed pronounced antibacterial and antifungal activity than 1,8-Cineole and alpha-Pinene against all of the tested microbes. Furthermore, the survival rates and morphological changes of S. aureus after treatment with different concentrations of the essential oil were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of a series of novel gatifloxacin derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel gatifloxacin (GTFX) derivatives were designed, synthesized and  characterized by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and HRMS. These derivatives were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. Our results reveal that most of the target compounds show good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE. Compounds 8, 14 and 20 have useful activity against all of the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains (MICs: 0.06-4 mug/mL). In particular, 20 possessing a broad antimicrobial spectrum (MICs: 0.06-1 mug/mL) was found to be 2-32-folds more potent than the reference drug levofloxacin and parent GTFX against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Detection of volatile compounds produced by microbial growth in urine by selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS).
AB  - Selected ion flow tube-mass spectrometry has been used to measure the volatile compounds occurring in the headspace of urine samples inoculated with common urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing microbes Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans. This technique has the potential to offer rapid and simple diagnosis of the causative agent of UTIs.
TI  - Surface acoustic waves increase the susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotic treatment.
AB  - Bacterial urinary tract infections resulting from prolonged patient catheterization have become a major health problem. One of the major issues is bacterial resistance to antibiotic treatments due to biofilm formation inside the catheters, thus enhancing the search for alternative treatments. In the present study, a device containing a piezo element capable of transmitting low-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAW) onto the indwelling catheter was used. The SAW were able to eradicate biofilm-residing bacteria by >85% when applied simultaneously with an antibiotic in three clinically relevant species, viz. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, transcriptome analysis revealed that SAW can alter the transcription pattern of P. aeruginosa, suggesting that this signal can be specifically sensed by the bacterium.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and various extracts of fruits of greater cardamom.
AB  - Greater cardamom (Amomum subulatum Roxb. Zingiberaceae) commonly known as "Bari ilaichi" is a well known plant used in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. It has been used for the treatment of various diseases and disorders like gastric ulcer. Therefore antimicrobial activity of petroleum ether, methanol and aqueous extracts from leaves and roots, essential oil and isolated vasicine from A. vasica were tested against various microorganisms. Antimicrobial activity was done by disc diffusion method. The zone of inhibition observed was compared with that of standard drugs, ciprofloxacin and fluconazole. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined against microorganisms used in the study. The results of this study reveal that methanol extract of fruits of A. subulatum shows remarkable antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli whereas in case of other microorganisms used it was found inferior to the standard drug used. Methanol extract of rind showed good antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that the essential oil isolated was effective against majority of microorganisms used viz. Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
TI  - Initial efforts toward the optimization of arylomycins for antibiotic activity.
AB  - While most clinically used antibiotics were derived from natural products, the isolation of new broad-spectrum natural products has become increasingly rare and narrow-spectrum agents are typically deemed unsuitable for development because of intrinsic limitations of their scaffold or target. However, it is possible that the spectrum of a natural product antibiotic might be limited by specific resistance mechanisms in some bacteria, such as target mutations, and the spectra of such "latent" antibiotics might be reoptimized by derivatization, just as has been done with clinically deployed antibiotics. We recently showed that the spectrum of the arylomycin natural product antibiotics, which act via the novel mechanism of inhibiting type I signal peptidase, is broader than previously believed and that resistance in several key human pathogens is due to the presence of a specific Pro residue in the target peptidase that disrupts interactions with the lipopeptide tail of the antibiotic. To begin to test whether this natural resistance might be overcome by derivatization, we synthesized analogues with altered lipopeptide tails and identified several with an increased spectrum of activity against S. aureus. The data support the hypothesis that the arylomycins are latent antibiotics, suggest that their spectrum may be optimized by derivatization, and identify a promising scaffold upon which future optimization efforts might focus.
TI  - Immobilized enzymes affect biofilm formation.
AB  - The effect of the activity of immobilized enzymes on the initial attachment of pathogenic bacteria commonly associated with nosocomial infections (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis) was investigated. The proteolytic enzymes, subtilisin A and the glycoside hydrolase cellulose, were covalently attached onto poly(ethylene-alt-maleic) anhydride copolymer films. A comparison between active and heat-inactivated surfaces showed that while the activity of immobilized cellulase reduced the attachment of S. epidermidis by 67%, it had no effect on the attachment of P. aeruginosa. Immobilized subtilisin A had opposite effects: the active enzyme had no effect on the attachment of S. epidermidis but reduced the attachment of P. aeruginosa by 44%. The results suggest that different biomolecules are involved in the initial steps of attachment of different bacteria, and that the development of broad-spectrum antifouling enzymatic coatings will need to involve the co-immobilization of enzymes.
TI  - Foam sclerotherapy: investigating the need for sterile air.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerotherapy with foam is becoming increasingly popular for the treatment of varicose veins. There is no consensus on the necessity of sterile air or other gases to produce foam. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential risk of bacterial inoculation of polidocanol (POL) foam using room air and the antimicrobial properties of polidocanol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The amount of airborne microorganisms was quantitatively measured. Four bacterial strains were tested for susceptibility to polidocanol: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Air measurements varied as a result of air movement and the number of people in the room. Although the risk of introducing one colony-formin unit can be calculated as less than 1 in 330, the clinical relevance is still to be determined. No inhibition of bacterial growth was achieved with POL in of any of the tested strains. CONCLUSIONS: Foam sclerotherapy with POL prepared in a standard treatment room is a safe procedure without the risk of introducing a severe bacterial complication. The use of sterile air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide is unnecessary and will make foam sclerotherapy with POL more elaborate and more expensive to use.
TI  - Sponge swabs increase sensitivity of sterility testing of processed bone and tendon allografts.
AB  - Sterility testing is the final, and critical, step in quality control of tissue banking. It informs the decision whether to release the tissue allografts for clinical use, or not. The most common method for sterility testing of structural bone and tendon allografts is to swab using cotton tip streaks. This method provides low recovery efficiency; and therefore may pass allografts with low bioburden, providing false negatives. Our pilot data revealed organism recovery efficiencies of 60, 30 and 100% from cotton swab, membrane filtration and sponge swaps, respectively. Our aim was to develop a high sensitivity sterility test for structural bone and tendon allografts using a sponge sampling method. Eighty-one bone and tendon allograft samples were inoculated with organism suspensions (10(2) or less organisms per 0.1 mL) of Clostridium sporogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus spp. Nasco sponges (4 x 8 cm) were used to aseptically sample the whole surface of allograft samples. The sponges were cut in half and cultured in either tryptone soya or fluid thioglycollate broths for 14 days. Positive culture samples were further examined for microbial morphology. The results showed that the sensitivity of the method, and negative predictive value, is 100% for all inoculated organisms incubated with thioglycollate. We conclude that this sponge sampling method should be applied as the standard for sterility testing of structural bone and tendon allografts.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants against clinical isolates of oral cancer cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppression of immune system in treated cancer patients may lead to secondary infections that obviate the need of antibiotics. In the present study, an attempt was made to understand the occurrence of secondary infections in immuno-suppressed patients along with herbal control of these infections with the following objectives to: (a) isolate the microbial species from the treated oral cancer patients along with the estimation of absolute neutrophile counts of patients (b) assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity medicinal plants against the above clinical isolates. METHODS: Blood and oral swab cultures were taken from 40 oral cancer patients undergoing treatment in the radiotherapy unit of Regional Cancer Institute, Pt. B.D.S. Health University,Rohtak, Haryana. Clinical isolates were identified by following general microbiological, staining and biochemical methods. The absolute neutrophile counts were done by following the standard methods. The medicinal plants selected for antimicrobial activity analysis were Asphodelus tenuifolius Cav., Asparagus racemosus Willd., Balanites aegyptiaca L., Cestrum diurnum L., Cordia dichotoma G. Forst, Eclipta alba L., Murraya koenigii (L.) Spreng. , Pedalium murex L., Ricinus communis L. and Trigonella foenum graecum L. The antimicrobial efficacy of medicinal plants was evaluated by modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. MIC and MFC were investigated by serial two fold microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Prevalent bacterial pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%), Escherichia coli (15.62%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.37%), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.81%), Proteus mirabilis (3.6%), Proteus vulgaris (4.2%) and the fungal pathogens were Candida albicans (14.6%), Aspergillus fumigatus (9.37%). Out of 40 cases, 35 (87.5%) were observed as neutropenic. Eight medicinal plants (A. tenuifolius, A. racemosus, B. aegyptiaca, E. alba, M. koenigii, P. murex R. communis and T. foenum graecum) showed significant antimicrobial activity (P < .05) against most of the isolates. The MIC and MFC values were ranged from 31 to 500 mug/ml. P. aeruginosa was observed highest susceptible bacteria (46.6%) on the basis of susceptible index. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that treated oral cancer patients were neutropenic and prone to secondary infection of microbes. The medicinal plant can prove as effective antimicrobial agent to check the secondary infections in treated cancer patients.
TI  - Polymeric Multilayers that contain Silver Nanoparticles can be Stamped onto Biological Tissues to Provide Antibacterial Activity.
AB  - We report the design of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) that can be prefabricated on an elastomeric stamp and mechanically transferred onto biomedically-relevant soft materials, including medical-grade silicone elastomers (E'~450-1500 kPa; E'-elastic modulus) and the dermis of cadaver-skin (E'~200-600 kPa). Whereas initial attempts to stamp PEMs formed from poly(allylamine hydrochloride) and poly(acrylic acid) resulted in minimal transfer onto soft materials, we report that integration of micrometer-sized beads into the PEMs (thicknesses of 6-160 nm) led to their quantitative transfer within 30 seconds of contact at a pressure of ~196 kPa. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, PEMs were impregnated with a range of loadings of silver-nanoparticles and stamped onto the dermis of human cadaver-skin (a wound-simulant) that was subsequently incubated with bacterial cultures. Skin-dermis stamped with PEMs that released 0.25+/-0.01 mug cm-2 of silver ions caused a 6 log10 reduction in colony forming units of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 12 h. Significantly, this level of silver release is below that which is cytotoxic to NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Overall, this study describes a general and facile approach for the functionalization of biomaterial surfaces without subjecting them to potentially deleterious processing conditions.
TI  - In vitro study of antibacterial activity of the alga Sargassum oligocystum from the Persian Gulf.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: With due attention to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, discovering of new antibacterial compounds is needed. Algae produce numerous bioactive substances which may have pharmacological properties such as antibacterial activity. The objective of this investigation was to in vitro study of antibacterial activity of brown alga Sargassum oligocystum collected along the Bushehr coast of Persian Gulf (south west of Iran). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hot water extract, cold water extract, and hot glycerin extract were prepared. The effect of the extracts were investigated on Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). RESULTS: Hot water extract exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cold water extract and hot glycerin extract did not show antibacterial activity on any of the four test bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of hot water extract for both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 3.175 mg/ml. However, the MIC of this extract for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 9.556 mg/ml. DISCUSSION: In this study gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to hot water extract than gram-negative bacteria. Extract of Sargassum oligocystum could be a candidate for purification and further in vivo studies.
TI  - Identification and characterization of breakthrough contaminants associated with  the conventional isolation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
AB  - Breakthrough contamination of tuberculosis (TB) cultures is a problem in that it  allows the overgrowth of another bacterium present in the sputum specimen, which can potentially mask the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the bacterial organisms responsible for such overgrowth and contamination, and to examine their susceptibility to (i) various chemical selective decontamination steps and (ii) antibiotics in liquid culture media, in an attempt to develop a method to help alleviate contamination problems associated with the conventional isolation of M. tuberculosis from routine patient sputum specimens. Bacterial contaminants from 102 routine sputum cultures were identified molecularly by 16S rRNA gene PCR and direct sequencing from contaminated Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) slopes and BacT/Alert liquid medium. It was found that the contaminants from LJ slopes belonged to 11 different genera and were composed largely of Gram-negative organisms (84.9 %; 45/53), whereas the liquid culture contaminants belonged to 13 different genera, with 37/66 isolates (56.1 %) being Gram-negative. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the dominant contaminant in both media. The effect of six different selective decontamination protocols was examined. Four of the six methods were effective at eliminating all culturable organisms present; these were 5 % oxalic acid, 5 % oxalic acid/2 % NaOH, 5 % oxalic acid/4 % NaOH and 1 % chlorhexidine. NaOH at a concentration of 2 or 4 % was less effective as it was unable to eliminate all organisms of each species tested, with the exception of P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, breakthrough contamination of TB cultures is due to a diverse range of at least 17 different bacterial genera, with P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis accounting for the dominant contaminating flora. Employment of chemical decontaminating protocols solely involving NaOH may lead to higher rates of contamination. Where such contamination is encountered, TB laboratories should consider the reprocessing of such sputum samples with an alternative decontamination method such as 1 % chlorhexidine.
TI  - Infections in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor antagonists: incidence, etiology and mortality in the BIOBADASER registry.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Whether the use of tumor necrosis factor antagonists increases the risk of infection remains a subject of open debate. Developing effective strategies of prevention and empirical treatment entails carefully establishing the etiology and prognosis of the infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis of the Spanish registry BIOBADASER (Feb-2000 to Jan-2006), a national drug safety registry of patients with rheumatic diseases. RESULTS: 907 episodes of infection occurring in 6,969 patients were analyzed. The infection incidence observed was 53.09 cases/1,000 patients-years (CI 95% 49.69-56.66). The most frequent infections were skin infection (12.18 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), pneumonia (5.97 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), cystitis (3.92 cases/1,000 patients-yrs), tuberculosis (3.51 cases/1,000 patients-yrs) and arthritis (3.76 cases/1,000 patients-yrs). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella spp. emerged as important pathogens. Varicella zoster virus and Herpes simplex virus caused most cases of viral infections. Mucocutaneous candidiasis accounted for most fungal infections. Mortality was increased in infected patients (log-rank test p<0.0001). Pneumonia, sepsis, tuberculosis, abdominal infection and endocarditis were associated with significant attributable mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of bacterial, viral and fungal infections occurred in patients with rheumatic diseases treated with TNF antagonists. The information of this study can illuminate clinicians globally on how to address infection in this vulnerable group of patients.
TI  - Antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - CONTEXT: Development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. Twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. Eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. Powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. RESULTS: Water extract of Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of Ficus carica L. (Moraceae) and Olea europaea L. (Oleaceae) leaves and Peganum harmala L. (Nitrariaceae) seeds had MIC ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. S. aromaticum inhibited growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. F. carica and O. europaea inhibited growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. pyogenes whereas P. harmala was effective against S. aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Candida albicans. Ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had MIC >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics in alloplastic  total temporomandibular joint replacement surgery: a survey and preliminary guidelines.
AB  - PURPOSE: In 2009, the American Academy Of Orthopedic Surgeons recommended lifelong prophylaxis after orthopedic total joint replacement (TJR) before these patients undergo dental, aerodigestive, genitourinary (GU), and gastrointestinal (GI) procedures. Because oral and maxillofacial surgeons worldwide are implanting alloplastic total temporomandibular joint replacements (TMJ TJRs), it appeared reasonable to survey these surgeons to obtain data that might shed some light, not only on this issue, but also to obtain some data to begin to develop preliminary guidelines for the peri- and postoperative use of antibiotics for TMJ TJR using these results and the orthopedic data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 surgeons worldwide, members of either the TMJ Concepts or Biomet Microfixation online networks were e-mailed a standard questionnaire surveying their perioperative, postoperative, and prophylactic use of antibiotics for their TMJ TJR cases. RESULTS: Of the 35 surgeons, 26 (74.2%) from 8 different countries responded. A total of 2,476 cases (3,368 joints) were retrospectively surveyed. Of the responding surgeons, 96.2% used, in order of frequency, cefazolin, clindamycin, cephalosporin, or penicillin-based antibiotics in the perioperative period and continued their use for a mean of 7 days (range 5 to 14) postoperatively. Also, 46.2% soaked the TJR components either in the perioperative antibiotic or in vancomycin, poviodine, gentamycin, or peroxide before implantation. In addition, 61.5% irrigated the wounds after device implantation with bacitracin, vancomycin, poviodine, peroxide, or the perioperative antibiotic. These surgeons reported that 51 joints (1.51%) had become infected within a mean of 6 months (range 2 weeks to 12 years) postoperatively. A total of 32 devices (0.95%) required removal and/or replacement. In cases in which the organisms were isolated, the organisms commonly associated with biofilm infection of TJR devices, Staphylococcus aureus, S epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus, and Pseudamonas aeruginosa, were cultured. In only 1 joint (0.003%) was there a suggestion of an association with an invasive dental/aerodigestive, GU/GI procedure. Regarding prophylaxis after TMJ TJRs and before dental/aerodigestive, GU, or GI procedures, 53.8% of the respondents reported that they provided prophylaxis. Of these, 1 recommended doing this for 6 months and 4 for 2 years, such as has been the American Dental Association/American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommendation since 2003; and 9 reported they believe these TMJ TJR patients should have lifetime antibiotic prophylaxis before invasive dental/aerodigestive, GU, or GI procedures. CONCLUSION: The evidence provided from the present small study survey and a review of the orthopedic data could provide the opportunity to develop guidelines for the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative antibiotic management for TMJ TJRs and spur additional research into this important area of patient management.
TI  - Peptide mimics of peptidoglycan are vaccine candidates and protect mice from infection with Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus drug resistance to antibiotics is a serious situation that  has drawn greater attention to immunotherapy and prophylaxis. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a common and conserved component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus. However, PGN, as a thymus-independent antigen, cannot be considered a vaccine candidate because of its very weak immunogenicity. In this study we have attempted to enhance the immunogenicity of PGN by identifying a PGN peptide mimic sequence that would act as a thymus-dependent antigen. Several peptide sequences were obtained from a phage display peptide library using a mAb against S. aureus PGN, and a 12-mer linear single peptide (Sp-31) and a four-branch multiple antigen peptide (MAP) (MAP-P31) were synthesized. Both Sp-31 and MAP-P31 were shown to bind directly to anti-PGN mAb and a polyclonal antibody against S. aureus. These peptides could also inhibit the binding of PGN to a mAb against PGN. Furthermore, MAP-P31 was able to provoke an effective secondary antibody response in mice to PGN and to cell-wall fragments isolated from S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by sonication. In addition, the MAP-P31 antiserum showed a potent bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus in the presence and absence of complement in vitro. Importantly, immunization with MAP-P31 significantly prolonged the survival and enhanced bacterial clearance in BALB/c mice challenged with live S. aureus. In addition, the serum IgG-type antibodies against PGN persisted in mice, demonstrating that MAP-P31, as a peptide mimicking epitopes on PGN, provokes an effective secondary or memory antibody response, which can only be induced by a thymus-dependent antigen and which protects against infection with S. aureus. These results suggest that MAP-31 may be a novel vaccine candidate against S. aureus.
TI  - The inhibitory activity of pomelo essential oil on the bacterial biofilms development on soft contact lenses.
AB  - The aim of present study was to investigate the microbial colonization of worn contact lenses (CLs) and to evaluate the inhibitory effect of pomelo (Citrus maxima) peels essential oil on the biofilm development on unworn CLs. The essential oil was isolated by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, twenty compounds being isolated. The antimicrobial activity of pomelo oil was tested against S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa strains, known for their ability to develop biofilms on prosthetic devices, by qualitative screening methods and quantitative assay of the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in order to evaluate the antibiofilm activity. Our study revealed that all worn CLs where 100% colonized by staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae strains. The pomelo essential oil inhibited the development of bacterial biofilms formed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms on soft CLs, its antibiofilm activity being specific and dependent on different physical parameters (contact time and temperature). The architecture of bacterial biofilms developed on soft contact lenses was analyzed using confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Greek endemic Stachys spruneri and its main component, isoabienol.
AB  - The essential oils of Stachys spruneri Boiss. (sample A and sample B) were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. (+)-Isoabienol was the dominant component (49.5 and 48.2%, respectively of the total oils) among seventy-two identified constituents. Isoabienol was separated, purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography, and further identified by means ofphysicochemical and spectrometric analysis. The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the essential oil and its main metabolite, the labdane diterpene isoabienol, were determined using the broth microdilution method against eight laboratory strains of bacteria (Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Gram- negative: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. Both essential oil and isoabienol showed considerable activity against all the microorganisms tested, with the isolated compound being most active.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections: results of the OASIS multicenter study.
AB  - Beginning on April 2007, a prospective multicenter study was performed to investigate prevalence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens causing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Twenty microbiology laboratories participated to the survey over a 1-year period. A total of 11,638 episodes of BSI occurred in 11 202 patients, with 8.5% (n=985) of episodes being polymicrobial. Of 12 781 causative organisms, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria were 47.4% (n=6058), whereas Gram-positives accounted for 43.9% (n=5608). The remaining organisms included fungal species (n=924, 7.2%) and anaerobes (n=191, 1.5%). The most prevalent agents were Escherichia coli (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.0%), and Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%). Isolates recovered from patients admitted to medical, surgical, and intensive care units accounted for 62.9%, 17.7%, and 19.4% of cases, respectively. BSIs were classified as hospital-acquired in 67.2% of cases. Compared with previous studies, our data show an increasing role of Gram-negative bacteria among both hospital- and community-acquired blood isolates.
TI  - [Infectious complications in patients with iatrogenic diseases of the trachea and esophagus].
AB  - Methods for microbiological monitoring could analyze the microflora isolated in 372 patients with iatrogenic diseases of the trachea and esophagus, who were treated at the Department for Surgery of the Lung and Mediastinum, Acad. B. V. Petrovsky Russian Research Center of Surgery, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, in 2003 to 2009. Major groups of microorganisms colonizing the tracheobronchial tree in patients who had undergone long-term resuscitation, injuries, surgery, etc. and in those who had admitted to the department from other clinics are identified. The main clinically significant microorganisms isolated during the pathological process in this area were Staphylococcus epidermadis (3.9-13.3%), St. aureus (12.4-21.1%), Pseudomonas eruginosa (9.2-17.5%), and Candida fungi (7.8-12.2%). This indicates the greater importance of the fungal microflora and its representatives' resistance to the most commonly used drugs. Rational antibacterial therapy regimens are proposed in relation to the type of microorganisms colonizing the tracheobronchial tree.
TI  - Improving the antibacterial property of porcine small intestinal submucosa by nano-silver supplementation: a promising biological material to address the need for contaminated defect repair.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that introduction of nano-silver particles to porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (NS-PSIS) would lead to significant enhancement in antibacterial property in repairing contaminated abdominal defect. BACKGROUND: Porcine-derived small intestinal submucosa (PSIS) is an acellular and xenogenic biological material intensively used in repairing and regenerating wounded and dysfunctional tissues. Surgical site infection (SSI) remains so far a serious problem and major challenge, particularly in contaminated tissue-deficient repairing. METHODS: Self-assembly was used to fabricate NS-PSIS. The antibacterial property was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by means of repairing full-thickness contaminated abdominal defect in rats. The native PSIS and polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose were served as controls. In addition, changes in biomechanical resistance, morphology and immunohistochemistry for inflammatory reaction and neovasculation in the repaired abdominal wall were analyzed. Biosafety was investigated by pyrogen test, skin irritation test and silver measurement in vivo. RESULTS: NS-PSIS exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on agar diffusion, with mean diameters of inhibition zone ranging from 11.9 to 23.5 mm. There were significantly lower SSI incidence and a tendency of better abdominal wall resistance in the NS-PSIS group as compared with the PSIS or polypropylene-oxidized regenerated cellulose group after repairing contaminated abdominal defect in rats. Nano-silver modified PSIS did not change the native PSIS property in the tissue recolonization, remodeling and neovascularization. NS-PSIS was not pyrogenic or skin irritated, without silver residual in vivo after repairing contaminated abdominal defect. CONCLUSION: Nano-silver particles to PSIS lead to significant enhancements in antibacterial property in vitro and in vivo without decreasing its biomechanical resistance and biocompatibility. This study provides proof of concept for the use of nano-silver modified naturally derived PSIS as an ideal scaffold for SSI prevention in the contaminated tissue-deficient repair.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of five needleless intravenous connectors.
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro differences of colony forming units (CFUs), of four different bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli), over 4 days, using bovine blood, in five intravenous needleless connectors (three negative, one positive, one zero). BACKGROUND: Availability of colony forming units creates a definitive environment for bloodstream infections and occlusions. Protection of the intraluminal pathway is one important way to help eliminate occlusions and catheter-related bloodstream infections and utilization of best available product(s) will aid in best patient outcomes. METHODS: Five different connectors evaluated in 2009 by an independent laboratory for in vitro differences about colony forming units of four different organisms over 4 days. RESULTS: The Q-Syte performed poorly on all organisms (P<0.0001). The MaxPlus((R)) Clear and MicroCLAVE((R)) fluctuated between high colony forming units (28.15 & 56.55 respectively) and zero colony forming units. The TKOClave((R)) stayed increased (high of 50.8 colony forming units). The RyMed-5001((R)) performed the best with very low colony forming units (2.25 CFUs to zero). CONCLUSIONS: Non-antimicrobial connectors differ on colony forming unit counts in vitro for four types of bacteria. Connectors with most colony forming units to least colony forming units included the Q-Syte, TKOClave((R)), MicroCLAVE((R)), MaxPlus((R)) Clear and RyMed-5001((R)). Connectors are one statistically significant variable (50%) in the development of occlusions and infections. Staff nurses, managers, infection control specialists and vascular access specialists in all settings need to use technologies that invoke the least patient harm. The RyMed-5001((R)) connector best protects the intraluminal pathway from bacteria compared with four other commonly used connectors in vitro.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Evaluation antimicrobial and antiadhesive properties of the biosurfactant Lunasan produced by Candida sphaerica UCP 0995.
AB  - Different groups of biosurfactants exhibit diverse properties and display a variety of physiological functions in producer microorganisms; these include enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic/water-insoluble compound, heave metal binding, bacterial pathogenesis, cell adhesion and aggregation, quorum sensing and biofilm formation. Candida sphaerica was grown in a low cost medium, consisting of distilled water supplemented with 9% refinery residue of soybean oil and 9% corn steep liquor, for 144 h at 28 degrees C and 150 rpm. The cell-free supernatant obtained at the end of the experiments was submitted to extraction, and afterward the biosurfactant was isolated using methanol with a yield of 9 g l(-1). The critical micelle concentration of the biosurfactant was found to be 0.25 mg ml(-1) with a surface tension of 25 mN m(-1). Several concentrations of the biosurfactant (0.625-10 mg ml(-1)) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial and antiadhesive activities against a variety of microorganisms. The biosurfactant showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus oralis (68%), Candida albicans (57%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis(57.6%) for the highest concentration tested. Furthermore, the biosurfactant at a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1) inhibited the adhesion between 80 and 92% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus sanguis12. Inhibition of adhesion with percentages near 100% occurred for the higher concentrations of biosurfactant used. Results gathered in this study point to a potential use of the biosurfactant in biomedical applications.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the indigenous earthworms Lampito mauritii (Kinberg) and Perionyx excavatus (Perrier).
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Earthworms respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms such as antimicrobial protein secretions. Most of the humoral defense proteins are synthesized in the skin itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a dried powder was prepared from two indigenous earthworms (Lampito mauritii and Perionyx excavatus) and tested against two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and five gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). RESULTS: The dried earthworm powder of two species shows a strong antibacterial activity against the S. aureus, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa bacterial strains. Of these, the 60 mug/mL/disc of P. excavatus earthworm powder shows more activity than the L. mauritii.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Chemical and antimicrobial treatments change the viscoelastic properties of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Changes in the viscoelastic material properties of bacterial biofilms resulting from chemical and antimicrobial treatments were measured by rheometry. Colony biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis or a mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa were subjected to a classical creep test performed using a parallel plate rheometer. Data were fit to the 4-parameter Burger model to quantify the material properties. Biofilms were exposed to the chloride salts of several common mono-, di-, and tri- valent cations, and to urea, industrial biocides, and antibiotics. Many of these treatments resulted in statistically significant alterations in the material properties of the biofilm. Multivalent cations stiffened the P. aeruginosa biofilm, while ciprofloxacin and glutaraldehyde weakened it. Urea, rifampin, and a quaternary ammonium biocide weakened the S. epidermidis biofilm. In general, there was no correspondence between the responses of the two different types of biofilms to a particular treatment. These results underscore the distinction between the killing power of an antimicrobial agent and its ability to alter biofilm mechanical properties and thereby influence biofilm removal. Understanding biofilm rheology and how it is affected by chemical treatment could lead to improvements in biofilm control.
TI  - Blood culture contamination in a neonatal intensive care unit in Shiraz, Southwest-Central Iran.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure bacterial contamination rates in blood culture specimens and distinguish sepsis from blood culture contamination in newborn hospitalized patients in a neonatal intensive care unit and to recognize the most commonly isolated bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples of 578 neonates were collected and cultured throughout the year of study (March 2006 to February 2007). Isolated bacteria were identified by traditional biochemical tests. Clinical criteria combined with laboratory data were used to differentiate the contaminated cultures from clinically significant cultures. RESULTS: Of the 578 neonatal blood culture samples, 78 (13.49%) were positive for bacteria, and 49 isolates (8.47%) were classified as contaminants. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common isolates from true bacteremia, and Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were the most common contaminants. CONCLUSION: The blood culture contamination rate in our studied neonatal intensive care unit was high. A variety of measures are recommended for reducing the rate of blood culture contamination to avoid undesirable outcomes associated with blood culture contamination.
TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Synthesis of cationic antimicrobial beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives with potential for oral administration.
AB  - We have prepared a series of highly potent achiral cationic beta(2,2)-amino acid  derivatives that fulfill the Lipinski's rule of five and that contain the basic structural requirements of short cationic antimicrobial peptides. Highest antimicrobial potency was observed for one of the smallest beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives (M(w) 423.6) exhibiting a MIC of 3.8 muM against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and Staphylococcus aureus, and 7.7 muM against Escherichia coli. The beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives were shown to have similar absorption properties as several commercially available drugs, and the results implied a resembling membrane disrupting mechanism of action as reported for much larger cationic antimicrobial peptides. By their high potency, nontoxicity, absorption properties, and ease of synthesis, the beta(2,2)-amino acid derivatives demonstrate a way to modify a vastly investigated class of cationic antimicrobial peptides into small drug-like molecules with high commercial potential.
TI  - Analysis of bacteremia/fungemia and pneumonia accompanying acute myelogenous leukemia from 1987 to 2001 in the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group.
AB  - We analyzed the incidence and prognosis of bacteremia/fungemia and pneumonia during remission induction therapy of a newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group treated with individual protocols of AML-87/-89 (1987-1991), AML-92 (1992-1995), AML-95 (1995-1997), and AML-97 (1997-2001). Bacteremia/fungemia was present in 251 of 2585 cases (9.7%); the causative microorganism was gram-positive bacteria (GPB) in 122 cases (49%), gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in 90 cases (36%), fungi (F) in 31 cases (12%), and polymicrobes (P) in 8 cases (3%). Particularly prevalent were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 49 cases (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 29 cases (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus in 25 cases (10%). With AML-87/-89, incidence of bacteremia/fungemia was 11.8% while it was 9.4% with AML-92, 8.7% with AML-95, and 9.2% with AML-97. The proportion of GPB, GNB, F, and P was 40, 41, 16, and 3% in AML-87/-89, 46, 40, 11, and 3% in AML-92, 48, 39, 11, and 2% in AML-95, and 59, 26, 11, and 4% in AML-97. The mortality rate by period was 26.5, 16.4, 14.0, and 6.8%, respectively. Pneumonia was found in 433 cases (16.8%); microbiological research covered 359 cases of AML-87/-89, AML-92, AML-97 and excluded AML-95 as there was no listing for the causative microorganism on questionnaires. Microbiologically documented pneumonia was found in 123 cases (34.3%), with GPB in 33 cases (27%), GNB in 28 cases (23%), F in 44 cases (36%), and P in 18 cases (15%); particularly prevalent were Aspergillus in 23 cases (19%), Staphylococcus aureus in 16 cases (13%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 15 cases (12%). The incidence of pneumonia overall was 24.6% with AML-87/-89, 16.9% with AML-92, 13.9% with AML-95, and 12.9% with AML-97, with a mortality rate of 28.9, 33.3, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Incidence of bacteremia/fungemia and pneumonia complicating AML has tended to decline in recent years, and mortality has also tended to improve.
TI  - A comparative study of sterility levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis system.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Peritonitis remains a serious risk associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), although better patient education programs and such technological advances as improved automated connecting devices have greatly decreased its incidence over the past 20 years. The automated devices have a good resistance to contamination, but they rely on an external electrical power source and are not easily portable. There has, therefore, been a need for a highly sterile nonelectric manual connecting device to complement the automated devices already in use. Such a manual device has recently been developed. We compared the level of sterility after touch contamination in this new device with levels in 2 other connecting devices: a conventional device with a manual cap (JMS Co. Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan), and a powered total containment device (JMS Co. Ltd.). METHOD: Five bacteria frequently causing CAPD-related peritonitis (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans) were separately applied to the tip of each connecting device, and peritoneal washing fluid was injected as in a routine exchange. We used a membrane filter method to determine whether the route had been contaminated by the washing fluid. RESULTS: In the conventional device with a manual cap, 3 to 4 colony-forming units (CFUs) of S. aureus were detected in 2 of 10 drainage samples, 8 CFUs of E. coli in 1 of 10 drainage samples, and 1 CFU of E. coli in the injection fluid. In contrast, no contamination was detected in the automated connecting device or the new manual cap device. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the new device has a risk of touch contamination lower than that of the conventional manual cap device and equal to that of the automated device. Being easily portable and not reliant on an external power source, the new device should be useful in various situations.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit  of Fatmawati Hospital, Indonesia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity pattern of bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia. METHODS: A cross sectional retrospective study of bacterial pathogen was carried out on a total of 722 patients that were admitted to the ICU of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia during January 2009 to March 2010. All bacteria were identified by standard microbiologic methods, and their antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Specimens were collected from 385 patients who were given antimicrobial treatment, of which 249 (64.68%) were cultured positive and 136 (35.32%) were negative. The most predominant isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (26.5%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (15.3%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.9%). P. aeruginosa isolates showed high rate of resistance to cephalexin (95.3%), cefotaxime (64.1%), and ceftriaxone (60.9%). Amikacin was the most effective (84.4%) antibiotic against P. aeruginosa followed by imipenem (81.2%), and meropenem (75.0%). K. pneumoniae showed resistance to cephalexin (86.5%), ceftriaxone (75.7%), ceftazidime (73.0%), cefpirome (73.0%) and cefotaxime (67.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Most bacteria isolated from ICU of Fatmawati Hospital Jakarta Indonesia were resistant to the third generation of cephalosporins, and quinolone antibiotics. Regular surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility patterns is very important for setting orders to guide the clinician in choosing empirical or directed therapy of infected patients.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.
TI  - "Scrub the hub": cleaning duration and reduction in bacterial load on central venous catheters.
AB  - This article reports the results of a study on the effect of alcohol disinfection duration on bacterial load on catheter hubs. Three different levels of disinfection (3, 10, and 15 seconds) were analyzed as well as a positive and negative control. All hubs with the exception of the negative controls were contaminated with a 10 bacterial solution and allowed to dry for 24 hours. Through each hub, 1 mL of sterile saline was flushed; a 10-muL calibrated loop was used to plate the flush onto blood agar. Colony counts were performed on the plates after a 24-hour incubation period. Results revealed that the 3 different levels of disinfection duration were not found to differ significantly in reduction in bacterial load. The duration of disinfection did not significantly change the bacterial load on the hub. However, any disinfection duration significantly decreased the bacterial load as compared to the positive control. A larger study would likely detect a significant result among the disinfections.
TI  - [Infection in patients with malignant tumors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characters of infection in patients with malignant  tumors, especially the distribution, yearly change of pathogens, and pathogen resistance to common antibacterial agents. METHODS: We respectively analyzed the characters of infection in 489 patients with malignant tumors. RESULTS: The respiratory tract was the most frequent infection site (61.1%). The infection was mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterias mainly consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii (46.3%). The Gram-positive bacteria mainly consisted of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), and the rest 23.8% of the infection was caused by different fungi, mainly consisting of Candida albicans. The ratio of the Gram-negative bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (except ceftazidime), sulfanilamides, tetracyclines and quinolones was higher. The ratio of the Gram-positive bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, macrolides and quinolones was higher. The ratio of fungus resistance to antibacterial agents such as fluconazol and itraconazole was higher. The infection caused by fungi obviously increased in the past 5 years. CONCLUSION: The infection in patients with malignant tumors is mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens, and the pathogen resistance to antibacterial agents is serious. The infection caused by fungi is increasing.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus against bacterial isolates from burn wounds.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are live microorganisms which are mainly strains of Lactobacillus spp., Bifidobacterium spp. When administered in adequate amounts, these microorganisms offer a health benefit for the host. Probiotic organisms are also available commercially in milk, sour milk, ice cream and other foods. AIMS: To identify bacterial species isolated from burn wounds, and also to evaluate (In-vitro) the therapeutic efficacy of Lacto. acidophilus against these bacterial isolates. To compare this activity to other antibacterial agents which are used medically in the treatment of burn wound cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Burn wound swabs were obtained from 50 patients who had been admitted to hospitals in Baghdad during August to November 2009. These swabs were inoculated onto enriched and differential culture media. Subcultures were performed on selective media. The necessary biochemical tests were conducted and the organisms identified using standard procedures. Susceptibility of isolated pathogens to local isolates Lacto. Acidophilus (with 1x10(8) cells/mL) and 10 commonly used burn wounds antibiotics was examined using standard susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Ninety different organisms were isolated. Gram-positive cocci accounted for 16 (17.7%) and gram-negative bacilli for 74 (82.2%) bacterial isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa 30(33.3%) were the most commonly isolated organisms, followed by Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp.(22.2,20,4.4,2.2%), respectively. Staphylococcus aureus isolates were performed in 8(8.8%). However, the incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was 2 (2.2%), while ss-haemolytic Streptococci was 4(4.4%). In susceptibility testing, Lacto. acidophilus had coverage against 90 (100%) of 74 gram-negative and 16 of gram-positive bacteria tested. The coverage of the remaining 10 antibacterial agents used was different in their activity (resistance or sensitivity), which ranged between 50-100%. CONCLUSION: The results of the study concluded that lactobacillus acidophilus concentration of 1x10(8) cells/mL had a high activity to inhibit the growth in-vitro of all pathogenic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, which cause burn wound infections. This indicated the therapeutic efficacy of lactobacillus acidophilus bacteria.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antibiotic activity of the arylomycin natural products is masked by natural target mutations.
AB  - Novel classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics are needed to treat multidrug-resistant pathogens. The arylomycin class of natural products inhibits a promising antimicrobial target, type I signal peptidase (SPase), but upon initial characterization appeared to lack whole-cell activity against most pathogens. Here, we show that Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is sensitive to the arylomycins, evolves resistance via mutations in SPase and that analogous mutations are responsible for the natural resistance of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We identify diverse bacteria lacking these mutations and demonstrate that most are sensitive to the arylomycins. The results illustrate that the arylomycins have a broad-spectrum of activity and are viable candidates for development into therapeutics. The results also raise the possibility that naturally occurring resistance may have masked other natural product scaffolds that might be developed into therapeutics.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in adult febrile neutropenic patients: a comparison between two time periods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to study trends in bacterial spectrum and susceptibility patterns of pathogens in adult febrile neutropenic patients during two time periods. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 379 adult oncology patients admitted with chemotherapy induced febrile neutropenia at our institute during years 2003 and 2006. RESULTS: A total of 151 organisms were isolated during the two calendar years. Gram negative bacteria accounted for 57.6% of organisms, while gram positive organisms accounted for 42.3% of the total isolates. The most common organisms were: Escherichia coli (23.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.9%). The number of gram positive isolates showed an increase from 35% in 2003 to 47.2% in 2006 (p = 0.13). During each calendar year, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were 100% susceptible to vancomycin and 33% strains of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin resistant. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were highly sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin during both time periods. Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ciprofloxacin increased from 0% in 2003 to 50% in 2006 (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Gram negative organisms are the predominant organisms in adult febrile neutropenic patients at our institute. Initial empirical therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam seems appropriate to cover most gram negative pathogens while vancomycin to be added for suspected gram positive infections. During the two calendar years resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ciprofloxacin has significantly increased.
TI  - Antibacterial action of a heat-stable form of L-amino acid oxidase isolated from  king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom.
AB  - The major l-amino acid oxidase (LAAO, EC 1.4.3.2) of king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah) venom is known to be an unusual form of snake venom LAAO as it possesses unique structural features and unusual thermal stability. The antibacterial effects of king cobra venom LAAO were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. For comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. King cobra venom LAAO was very effective in inhibiting the two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78mug/mL (0.006muM) and 1.56mug/mL (0.012muM) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively. The MICs are comparable to the MICs of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. However, the LAAO was only moderately effective against three Gram-negative bacteria tested (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), with MIC ranges from 25 to 50mug/mL (0.2-0.4muM). Catalase at the concentration of 1mg/mL abolished the antibacterial effect of LAAO, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. Binding studies indicated that king cobra venom LAAO binds strongly to the Gram-positive S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but less strongly to the Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.
TI  - Efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone iodine (PI) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. METHODS: CHG and PI, alone and combined, were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible S aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/mL at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. Fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (FBCIs) were calculated to determine CHG and PI compatibility. Additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with S aureus (MSSA), treated for 2 hours with CHG 3%, PI 5%, or CHG 3% and PI 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. RESULTS: In broth, CHG demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas PI activity was all-or-none. All isolates studied were similarly susceptible to CHG (MBCs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). The MBCs of PI were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. Overall, FBCI calculations showed indifference. Treatment of MSSA-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated that the CHG-PI combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. CONCLUSION: FBCIs, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining CHG and PI had no negative impact on antisepsis. Moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of the essential oils of commonly consumed medicinal herbs  using an in vitro model.
AB  - The chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from 10 commonly consumed herbs: Citrus aurantium, C. limon, Lavandula angustifolia, Matricaria chamomilla, Mentha piperita, M. spicata, Ocimum basilicum, Origanum vulgare, Thymus vulgaris and Salvia officinalis have been determined. The antibacterial activity of these oils and their main components; i.e. camphor, carvacrol, 1,8-cineole, linalool, linalyl acetate, limonene, menthol, a-pinene, b-pinene, and thymol were assayed against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Micrococcus flavus, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, S. epidermidis, S. typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest and broadest activity was shown by O. vulgare oil. Carvacrol had the highest antibacterial activity among the tested components.
TI  - Maxillary sinuses microbiology from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - There isn't definitive and consistent data concerning the distribution of bacterial species in patients with Chronic Sinusitis (CS). The variability of the results from studies in CS may be due to the different techniques used as collection method, variations in culture methods, previous antibiotic use, and difficulty in distinguishing bacterial flora from pathogenic agents. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical prospective. AIM: To identify the incidence of microorganisms in patients with CRS by growing bacteria from the secretion of the maxillary sinus. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 62 patients that had undergone FESS for treatment of chronic sinusitis; cultures from the maxillary sinus were obtained. RESULTS: 62 samples, 33 (53.2%) had no growth; 29 (45.2%) counts of aerobic bacteria; one case (1.6%) of fungus growth; we did not find anaerobic bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the one more frequently found - 8 samples (27.6%), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis in 4 samples each; Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 samples (10.4%); other Gram negative agents in 17 samples (31%). CONCLUSION: In the present study we concluded that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Gram negatives bacteria and Staphylococcus spp were the representatives of the bacterial flora found in the paranasal sinuses of patients with CS.
TI  - Screening test for quality control of surface barrier discharged plasma sources with the microorganism-agar test (MAT).
AB  - In the recent past, the antimicrobial applicability of tissue tolerable plasma (TTP) has been examined, and is increasing in importance. Many different plasma sources can be used medically. In order to obtain reliable test results by using plasma sources, it is essential not only to assess physical parameters but also to screen a use-oriented application of plasma sources. It is necessary to both determine the biological efficacy and establish uniform coverage of the treated surfaces. This article shows a simple screening method for this. We used newly inoculated agar plates with bacterial test organisms and treated the agar plates with two surface barrier discharged (SDB) plasmas. The carrier gas was argon and air.
TI  - Synergy of nitric oxide and silver sulfadiazine against gram-negative, gram-positive, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The synergistic activity between nitric oxide (NO) released from diazeniumdiolate-modified proline (PROLI/NO) and silver(I) sulfadiazine (AgSD) was evaluated against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis using a modified broth microdilution technique and a checkerboard-type assay. The combination of NO and AgSD was defined as synergistic when the fractional bactericidal concentration (FBC) was calculated to be <0.5. Gram-negative species were generally more susceptible to the individual antimicrobial agents than the Gram-positive bacteria, while Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible to combination therapy. The in vitro synergistic activity of AgSD and NO observed against a range of pathogens strongly supports future investigation of this therapeutic combination, particularly for its potential use in the treatment of burns and chronic wounds.
TI  - Medical-grade honey enriched with antimicrobial peptides has enhanced activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Honey has potent activity against both antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant bacteria, and is an interesting agent for topical antimicrobial application to wounds. As honey is diluted by wound exudate, rapid bactericidal activity up to high dilution is a prerequisite for its successful application. We investigated the kinetics of the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by RS honey, the source for the production of Revamil(R) medical-grade honey, and we aimed to enhance the rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey by enrichment with its endogenous compounds or the addition of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). RS honey killed antibiotic-resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and Burkholderia cepacia within 2 h, but lacked such rapid activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. It was not feasible to enhance the rapid activity of RS honey by enrichment with endogenous compounds, but RS honey enriched with 75 muM of the synthetic peptide Bactericidal Peptide 2 (BP2) showed rapid bactericidal activity against all species tested, including MRSA and ESBL E. coli, at up to 10-20-fold dilution. RS honey enriched with BP2 rapidly killed all bacteria tested and had a broader spectrum of bactericidal activity than either BP2 or honey alone.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Cajanol inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by acting on membrane and DNA damage.
AB  - In the present study, the mechanism of antibacterial activity of cajanol extracted from the roots of Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp. towards Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was investigated. The antibacterial activity of cajanol was evaluated towards six bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by the broth microdilution method. It showed strong antibacterial activity towards all bacteria tested with minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) values ranging from 98.90 microM to 197.8 microM. Cajanol-induced death rates in the most sensitive strains ( E.COLI, 96.55 % and S. AUREUS, 97.25 %) were analyzed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the activity of cajanol on the membranes of E. coli and S. aureus was investigated by using lecithin, phosphate groups, and fluorescence microscopy. Cajanol-induced DNA damage was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. In summary, cajanol inhibited E. coli only by DNA damage, whereas S. aureus was inhibited by affecting both, the lecithin and phosphate groups on the cellular membrane and DNA. The present study shows that cajanol possesses antibacterial activity in vitro towards both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and therefore may be a promising candidate as an antibacterial agent for the therapy of microbial infections.
TI  - Frequency of catheter related infections in haemodialysed uraemic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of bacteraemia and bacterial colonization related to the use of dual-lumen catheters in ESRD patients on haemodialysis. METHODS: Sixty patients with ESRD of varied etiologies, both males and females falling in the age range (16-74 years) were randomly selected. Non-cuffed, non-tunneled polyurethane double lumen catheters were inserted under aseptic technique. Patients on twice a week schedule of haemodialysis were followed up for a period of 5 months. After every haemodialysis session, catheters were examined for any local infection or signs of bacteraemia. In case of suspicion, distal 5 cm segment of the catheter, and local pus swab and two blood culture samples were sent to the pathology laboratory. RESULT: Thirty one catheters (51.6%) sent for culture and sensitivity showed colonization (> 15 CFU). Bacteraemia was positive in 15 (25%) patients. Thirteen (41.9%) catheter tips were found to be colonized by staphylococcus epidermidis, eleven (35.4%) by staphylococcus aureus, three (0.96%) by Candida albicans species, two (6.45%) by E coli, one (3.2%) by P Aeruginosa and one (3.2%) by mixed Pseudomonas and E coli respectively. CONCLUSION: Non cuffed non tunneled double lumen catheters are designed for short-term emergency use and should be used in the same context. Although pathogenesis of catheter related infection is multifactorial the transcutaneous migration of organisms colonizing the skin remains the most important route.
TI  - [Changes of pathogens for nosocomial infection of patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - In order to investigate the distribution of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological diseases in our hospital, and to explore the changes of the pathogens isolated. The method of retrospective investigation and analysis was employed. 1164 strain pathogens were isolated from the patients with hematological diseases during the period of 1997-2009. The results showed that the Gram-positive cocci infection increased gradually during the 13 years, but has been stable in the last 4 years. The Gram-negative bacteria showed a trend decrease. The fungi increased during these years. The rates of infection with gram-positive cocci, gram-negative bacteria and fungus were 28.2%, 59.8% and 12.0% respectively. For the details, Escherichia coli infection rate was the highest: 12.1%, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.1%), Enterobacter (8.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.3%) and Enterococci (6.6%). The distribution of G(+)- and G(-) pathogens showed obvious change on end of 1990's and beginning of this century, but it was tending towards stability on recent years; the incidence of fungus was tending towards increase, which was related to wide application of strong broad-spectrum antibiotics. In conclusion, the patients with hematological diseases, as the high-risk group of nosocomial infection, should be monitored strictly. Infection is related to many factors, and the main factor is dysfunction of autoimmunity. The strategies should be explored to strengthen the immune protection and set up a reasonable scheme of antibiotics.
TI  - Antibiotic producing potentials of three freshwater actinomycetes isolated from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.
AB  - Crude extracts of three actinomycetes species belonging to Saccharopolyspora (TR  046 and TR 039) and Actinosynnema (TR 024) genera were screened for antibacterial activities against a panel of several bacterial strains. The extracts showed antibacterial activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive test bacteria with inhibition zones ranging from 8 to 28 mm (TR 046); 8 to15 mm (TR 039); and 10 to 13 mm (TR 024). The minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 0.078 to 10 mg/mL (TR 046); 5 to >10 mg/mL (TR 039); and 1.25 to 5 mg/mL (TR 024). Time-kill studies revealed that crude extract of TR 046 showed strong bactericidal activity against Bacillus pumilus (ATCC14884), reducing the bacterial load by 10(4) cfu/mL and 10(2) cfu/mL at 4x MIC and 2x MIC, respectively, after 6 h of exposure. Similarly, against Proteus vulgaris (CSIR 0030), crude extract of TR 046 achieved a 0.9log(10) and 0.13log(10) cfu/mL reduction at 5 mg/mL (4x MIC) and 1.25 mg/mL (2x MIC) after 12 h of exposure. The extract was however weakly bactericidal against two environmental bacterial strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis); and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 19582): the extract showed bacteriostatic activities at all concentrations tested. These freshwater actinomycetes appear to have immense potential as a source of new antibacterial compound(s).
TI  - [Biofilm--still a problem?].
AB  - Biofilm formation is a crucial step in the pathogenesis of many subacute and chronic bacterial infections, including foreign body-related infections. Biofilms are difficult to eradicate with conventional antimicrobial agents. Bacterial biofilms have several potential antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Persister cells play a major role in the tolerance of biofilm bacteria to antimicrobial agents. The most common microorganisms responsible for about two thirds of infections with foreign material are biofilm-forming bacteria such as staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. lungdunensis), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus spp, as well as fungal infections such as Candida sp. Preventing early colonisation is a good strategy for reducing morbidity and furthermore, reducing biofilm-associated infection reduces the need for antibiotic use.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Successful application of vacuum-assisted closure therapy for treatment of mastitis-associated chronic breast wounds.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although non-puerperal mastitis is rare and its cause is rather unclear, the number of patients diagnosed with this defect is increasing. In some cases, standard therapy fails and it progresses to a chronic disease. Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy has shown good results in healing complex wounds. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The goal of this study was to evaluate our experiences with VAC therapy and to answer the question whether or not should be accepted as an effective treatment in healing chronic wounds caused by non-puerperal mastitis. Retrospectively, we identified five patients with a non-puerperal mastitis chronic wound that was treated using VAC and report on their outcome. RESULTS: We reached both wound control and closure of the breast wounds in all patients. CONCLUSION: According to our findings, the VAC therapy can be considered when managing challenging breast wounds, particularly when other therapeutic options have failed. The role of VAC therapy as a primary therapeutic option has not yet been evaluated.
TI  - Decrease in serum valproic acid levels during treatment with ertapenem.
AB  - PURPOSE: A possible interaction between valproic acid and ertapenem resulting in  reduced serum valproic acid levels in two patients is reported. SUMMARY: In the first case, a 47-year-old woman was brought to the emergency department (ED) with fever, pain, redness, swelling, and local heat in the tissue around her tracheostomy tube and left foot. One month prior she was hospitalized with pneumonia and had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She was given teicoplanin and amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium as empirical therapy for cellulitis. On day 3, the patient developed a fever. Amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium was discontinued and replaced by i.v. ertapenem. On day 5, due to a suspected drug-induced fever, carbamazepine was discontinued, and oral valproate sodium was initiated. On day 16, the patient was afebrile, so ertapenem was discontinued. Her serum valproic acid concentration was <1 mg/L, but seizures did not recur. Three days after ertapenem was discontinued, her serum valproic acid concentration increased to 33.6 mg/L. In the second case, a 72-year-old woman was brought to the ED after a sudden loss of consciousness and convulsive seizure. The patient was diagnosed with status epilepticus and admitted to the intensive care unit. A urine culture revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and she was given cefpirome and valproate sodium. On day 15, cefpirome was replaced with ertapenem. On day 21, she had a seizure, and her serum valproic acid levels was found to be <1 mg/L. Ertapenem was discontinued after 14 days. Her serum valproic acid levels continued to increase until discharge on day 42. CONCLUSION: After initiation of ertapenem, decreased serum valproic acid levels were observed in two patients.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy by liposome-encapsulated water-soluble photosensitizers.
AB  - Photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy is an alternative method for killing bacterial cells in view of the increasing problem of multi-antibiotic resistance. We examined the effect of three water-soluble photosensitizers (PhS): methylene blue (MB), neutral red (NR) and rose bengal (RB) on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We compared the efficacy of PhS in their free form and encapsulated in liposomal formulations against various bacterial strains, and determined conditions for the effective use of encapsulated PhS. We found that all three PhS were able to eradicate the Gram-positive microbes Staphylococcus aureus and Sarcina lutea; and MB and RB were effective against St. epidermidis. In the case of the Gram-negative species, MB and RB were cytotoxic against the Shigella flexneri, NR-inactivated Escherichia coli and Salmonella para B, and BR was effective in killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of the examined PhS showed activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae. MB and NR enclosed in liposomes gave a stronger antimicrobial effect than free PhS for all tested prokaryotes, whereas encapsulation of RB led to no increase in its activity. We suggest that encapsulation of PhS can increase the photoinactivation of bacteria.
TI  - Pets-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis: companion animals or trojan horses?
AB  - Infectious peritonitis is still a major concern in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Standard antibiotic regimens target common causative microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When the infection does not respond, unusual infective agents are to be considered including zoonoses-infections with an animal source. Companion animals or occupations involving animal contact favor the development of zoonoses, especially for immunocompromised patients such as those with end-stage renal disease. We reviewed the literature for all animals-related peritonitis in PD and analyzed data from our own PD unit and from the French-speaking registry for peritoneal dialyis (RDPLF) to assess both the frequency and the potential risk for PD patients in owning a pet or to working with animals. In a literature search, we identified 124 cases of PD peritonitis caused by 12 different zoonotic agents. Animals were involved in 24% of the cases. Overall mortality rate was 13.5% and Tenckhoff catheters had to be removed in 27% of the cases. The results from RDPLF analysis show that zoonotic microorganisms were responsible for 0.54% of the peritonitis episodes (51 out of a total of 9433 during a 9-year period). In our unit, zoonotic microorganisms were responsible for 0.03% of the peritonitis episodes (four out of a total of 128 during a 9-year period). Considering those results, some specific treatment recommendations can be made, but the major factor still remains prevention, by insisting on strict hygenic measures when a PD patient owns a pet.
TI  - Preparation and in-vitro Antibacterial Evaluation of Electroless Silver Coated Polymers.
AB  - Long-term use of indwelling medical catheters has often been hindered by catheter-associated nosocomial infections. In this study the effectiveness of silver coating of polystyrene and polyethylene polymers was investigated. Polymer pieces of 2 cm(2) each were coated with a thin layer of silver using electroless plating technique. Silver-coated polymers were challenged with cultures of four different microorganisms known for their involvement in nosocomial infections in both solid and broth media. The tested bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Silver release from the coated polymers was 2-5 mug/cm(2) which was confirmed by chemical and biological methods. The silver coating thickness ranged between 20-450 nm. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were the most adherent bacteria to polystyrene sheets while E. coli showed minimum adherence effect. The survival rate of different bacteria after 80 min in a time course experiment tended to dominate E. coli as the most sensitive bacteria to the effect of silver with zero survival rate while around 4% of P. aeruginosa were detected after same period. Silver coating of indwelling polymers by electroless technique seems promising in combating nosocomial infections due to long-term catheterization.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Effects of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilm formation.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often found in chronic infections, including cystic fibrosis lung infections and those related to chronic wounds and venous ulcers. At the latter sites, P. aeruginosa can be isolated together with Staphylococcus epidermidis, and we have therefore explored the effect of clinical isolates and laboratory strains of P. aeruginosa strains on colonization by S. epidermidis in dual-species biofilms. Biofilm formation was assayed using 16S rRNA FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Among the six P. aeruginosa strains tested, one particular strain, denoted 14:2, exerted a significant inhibitory effect, and even after 6 h, S. epidermidis levels in dual-species biofilms were reduced by >85% compared with those without P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, strain 14:2 was found to be negative for classical virulence determinants including pyocyanin, elastase and alkaline protease. Therefore, we suggest that less virulent phenotypes of P. aeruginosa, which may develop over time in chronic infections, could counteract colonization by S. epidermidis, ensuring persistence and dominance by P. aeruginosa in the host micro-habitat. Further studies are required to explain the inhibitory effect on S. epidermidis, although extracellular polysaccharides produced by P. aeruginosa might play a role in this phenomenon.
TI  - Chemical composition of the SFE-CO extracts from Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth and their antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activities of SFE-CO(2)(supercritical fluid extraction) extracts and ethanol extracts from Cajanus cajan (L.) Huth were investigated. The flavonoid compounds orientin, vitexin, isovitexin, pinostrobin and the stilbene cajaninstilbene acid were detected in SFE-CO(2) extracts by HPLC-DAD. In vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts were evaluated against eight microbial strains (the bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli; and the fungi Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). A marked inhibitory effect of the SFE extracts was observed against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. The IC(50) of SFE-CO(2) extracts ranged from 0.0557 mg/ml to 0.0689 mg/ml consisting of cancer (MCF-7 (0.0557 mg/ml)) as well as non-cancer (BHK-21 (0.0641 mg/ml), RAW264.7 (0.0689 mg/ml) and Vero (0.0625 mg/ml)) cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to analyze death rate of the most sensitive strain (Staphylococcus aureus) caused by the SFE extracts. Additionally, the whole cell proteins of Staphylococcus aureus were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to detect if there were changes in protein patterns. In vivo antimicrobial activity was studies in mice that had been inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. The potential mechanism of antimicrobial activity in vivo was studied by histopathology.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - In vitro activity of the Qoustic Wound Therapy System against planktonic and biofilm bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the Qoustic Wound Therapy System (Arobella Medical, LLC, Minnetonka, Minnesota) kills planktonic bacterial cells and/or removes bacterial biofilms. DESIGN: The Qoustic Wound Therapy System was evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus planktonic cells and biofilms in vitro. MAIN RESULTS: P aeruginosa, S epidermidis, and S aureus planktonic cells decreased by a mean of 5.10, 4.99, and 5.22 log10 colony-forming units/mL, respectively, with 4 Qoustic Wound Therapy System treatment minutes. After 10 minutes of treatment, P aeruginosa, S epidermidis, and S aureus biofilms decreased by a mean of 1.34, 1.46, and 1.02 log10 colony-forming units/cm, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Qoustic Wound Therapy System, using the Qoustic Qurette, kills planktonic bacteria and reduces bacterial biofilms in vitro.
TI  - [The role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group A Streptococci (BHAS). Specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. In other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. It was shown that BHAS are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.
TI  - Mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  - The oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. When this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. Generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. The mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. Several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the Streptococcus (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis) and Staphylococcus (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis. In addition, some members of both the Streptococcus and the Staphylococcus genera, as well as Porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. The current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. The pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Absence of bacterial resistance to medical-grade manuka honey.
AB  - Clinical use of honey in the topical treatment of wounds has increased in Europe  and North America since licensed wound care products became available in 2004 and 2007, respectively. Honey-resistant bacteria have not been isolated from wounds, but there is a need to investigate whether honey has the potential to select for honey resistance. Two cultures of bacteria from reference collections (Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 10017 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and four cultures isolated from wounds (Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. epidermidis) were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of manuka honey in continuous and stepwise training experiments to determine whether the susceptibility to honey diminished. Reduced susceptibilities to manuka honey in the test organisms during long-term stepwise resistance training were found, but these changes were not permanent and honey-resistant mutants were not detected. The risk of bacteria acquiring resistance to honey will be low if high concentrations are maintained clinically.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2008].
AB  - We examined the antimicrobial activities of meropenem and other antibiotics against main bacteria isolated from patient blood in Keio university hospital between January and November in 2008. A total of 187 isolates, including 43 Escherichia coli, 23 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Enterobacter cloacae, 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 24 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 50 Staphylococcus epidermidis were tested. Meropenem showed the potent and stable antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria especially compared with our previous testing data. These results suggested that meropenem was first-line antibiotic for serious infections, although over 12 years passed after meropenem was approved in Japan.
TI  - Differential effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on biofilm formation by different  strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis are common opportunistic pathogens associated with medical device-related biofilm infections. 16S rRNA-FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy were used to study these two bacteria in dual-species biofilms. Two of the four S. epidermidis strains used were shown to form biofilms more avidly on polymer surfaces than the other two strains. In dual-species biofilms, the presence of P. aeruginosa reduced biofilm formation by S. epidermidis, although different clinical isolates differed in their susceptibility to this effect. The most resistant isolate coexisted with P. aeruginosa for up to 18 h and was also resistant to the effects of the culture supernatant from P. aeruginosa biofilms, which caused dispersal from established biofilms of other S. epidermidis strains. Thus, different strains of S. epidermidis differed in their capacity to withstand the action of P. aeruginosa, with some being better equipped than others to coexist in biofilms with P. aeruginosa. Our data suggest that where S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa are present on abiotic surfaces such as medical devices, S. epidermidis biofilm formation can be inhibited by P. aeruginosa through two mechanisms: disruption by extracellular products, possibly polysaccharides, and, in the later stages, by cell lysis.
TI  - Novel composites materials from functionalized polymers and silver coated titanium oxide capable for calcium phosphate induction, control of orthopedic biofilm infections: an "in vitro" study.
AB  - Three copolymers containing the functional groups P=O, S=O and C=O were prepared, and upon the introduction in calcium phosphate aqueous solutions at physiological conditions, "in vitro" were induced the precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals. The investigation of the crystal growth process was done at constant supersaturation. It is suggested that the negative end of the above functional groups acts as the active site for nucleation of the inorganic phase. In order to obtain the copolymer further antimicrobial activity, titania (TiO(2)) nanocrystals were incorporated in the polymer matrix after silver coverage by UV radiation. The antimicrobial resistance of the composite material (copolymer-titania/Ag) was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis (SEM), Staphylococcus aureus (SAM), Candida parapsilosis (CAM) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PAM), microorganisms, using cut parts of "pi-plate" that covered with the above mentioned composite. The antimicrobial effect increased as the size of the nanocrystals TiO(2)/Ag decreased, the maximum achieved with the third polymer that contained also quartenary ammonium groups.
TI  - Isolation, Characterization and Biological evaluation of secondary metabolite from Aspergillus funiculosus.
AB  - Screening of Aspergillus funiculosus for bioactive secondary metabolites produced kojic acid, which is know to have wide range of biological properties. It is very active against Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, but moderately active against yeasts and Gram-positive bacteria except Staphylococcus epidermidis. Filamentous Fungi are more sensitive to kojic acid. When it exposed to larvicidal activity on Aedes aegypti third instar larvae are more sensitive than early fourth instar larvae.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Silver nanoparticles impede the biofilm formation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Biofilms are ensued due to bacteria that attach to surfaces and aggregate in a hydrated polymeric matrix. Formation of these sessile communities and their inherent resistance to anti-microbial agents are the source of many relentless and chronic bacterial infections. Such biofilms are responsible play a major role in development of ocular related infectious diseases in human namely microbial keratitis. Different approaches have been used for preventing biofilm related infections in health care settings. Many of these methods have their own demerits that include chemical based complications; emergent antibiotic resistant strains, etc. silver nanoparticles are renowned for their influential anti-microbial activity. Hence the present study over the biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles, exhibited a potential anti-biofilm activity that was tested in vitro on biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis during 24-h treatment. Treating these organisms with silver nanoparticles resulted in more than 95% inhibition in biofilm formation. The inhibition was known to be invariable of the species tested. As a result this study demonstrates the futuristic application of silver nanoparticles in treating microbial keratitis based on its potential anti-biofilm activity.
TI  - Alkaloids from the bark of Guatteria hispida and their evaluation as antioxidant  and antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phytochemical investigation of the bark of Guatteria hispida afforded three new alkaloids, 9-methoxy-O-methylmoschatoline (1), 9-methoxyisomoschatoline (2), and isocerasonine (3), along with 10 known alkaloids, 8-oxopseudopalmatine (4), O-methylmoschatoline (5), lysicamine (6), liriodenine (7), 10-methoxyliriodenine (8), nornuciferine (9), anonaine (10), xylopine (11), coreximine (12), and isocoreximine (13). The major compounds, 2, 6, 12, and 13, showed significant antioxidant capacity in the ORAC(FL) assay. Compounds 5, 6, and 7 were active against S. epidermidis and C. dubliniensis, with MIC values in the range 12.5-100 microg mL(-1).
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial studies of 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-arylsulfanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4] triazolo-3-ones and their corresponding sulfones.
AB  - In the present investigation, a series of novel 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-5-methyl-4-(2-arylsulfanyl-ethyl)-2,4-dihydro-[1,2,4] triazolo-3-ones and their corresponding sulfones were prepared with the objective of developing better antimicrobial agents. The chemical structures of the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by spectral (IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and LCMS) methods. The newly synthesized compounds (4a-i) and (5a-e, 5h) were screened for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antifungal activity was tested against Rhizopus oryzae, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among all the compounds synthesized, compounds 4d and 5b exhibited significant antibacterial activity.
TI  - In vitro studies of a novel antimicrobial luer-activated needleless connector for prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We report in vitro studies of a commercially available novel antimicrobial Luer-activated connector with the inner surface coated with nanoparticle-silver to prevent contaminants from forming biofilm and causing catheter-related bloodstream infection. METHODS: Sterile control nonmedicated connectors and antimicrobial connectors were filled with approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/mL of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans; after 24 h of incubation, the numbers of remaining viable microorganisms were quantified and compared with the concentration in control connectors ( approximately 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL). In trials simulating clinical use, septal membranes of connectors were inoculated with E. cloacae, were allowed to dry, and were then actuated and infused with lactated ringer's solution for 72 h, with sampling for microorganisms in downstream efferent fluid and for biofilm in the connector. RESULTS: Microorganisms suspended in the intraluminal fluid path of antimicrobial connectors were rapidly killed. For 5 species, there was a 5.23-6.80 mean log(10) reduction (>99.999%), and with C. albicans, there was a 99.9% reduction. In clinical simulation trials, heavy contamination of downstream fluid was detected at all time points with control connectors, reaching approximately 1 x 10(5) cfu/mL at 72 h, and heavy biofilm was uniformly present; with the antimicrobial connectors, there was complete prevention of downstream fluid contamination and total absence of biofilm formation. CONCLUSIONS: These simulation experiments show that needleless connectors readily acquire an internal biofilm when microorganisms gain access to the internal fluid path and that biofilm formation allows an exponential buildup of internal contamination, with shedding back into the fluid path and downstream sufficient to cause bacteremia. Incorporation of nanoparticle silver into the lining surfaces of the novel connector kills microorganisms in the fluid pathway and prevents internal biofilm formation, even with high levels of introduced contamination and continuous fluid flow. This technology deserves to be evaluated in a prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine its capacity to prevent catheter-associated bloodstream infection.
TI  - Microbicidal efficacy of povidone-iodine in a noncontact manner applied to a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis connection system.
AB  - In peritoneal dialysis (PD) the dialysate is introduced into the peritoneal cavity, and the peritoneal membrane is used as the dialysis membrane. In PD, patients exchange the dialysate by themselves through the connection tube attached to the indwelling catheter that is inserted into the peritoneal cavity. Microbes may enter the peritoneal cavity during dialysate exchange, and, therefore, peritonitis is a potential complication of PD. To prevent microbial contamination, the connection tube tip is generally sealed with a protection cap containing povidone-iodine (PVP-I) during the dwelling time. This cap is designed to make direct contact with the tube tip so that microbes attached during dialysate exchange are killed by the next dialysate exchange. However, if excess PVP-I flows into the peritoneal cavity and is absorbed into the body, the complications, including thyroid dysfunction, peritoneal inflammation, and fibrous thickening, can develop. Therefore, in this study, a new manual connection system (Zero System, JMS Co., Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan) for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was investigated to confirm that the PVP-I solution within the protection cap of the new system would not flow into the fluid passing through the tube. An experiment was also performed to confirm that the microbes on the connector tip become completely nonviable after attachment of the cap for 3 hours. The cap is fitted with a sponge containing a 10% PVP-I solution, the same as for the conventional cap system. However, the system is designed to achieve disinfection without contact, unlike with the conventional system, in which disinfection is achieved by direct contact of the PVP-I-containing sponge with the open end of the attached connector. The test results demonstrated that adequate disinfection with this system can be achieved by the next exchange, while avoiding entry of PVP-I into the peritoneal cavity from the cap. The results suggest that the use of this connection system can avoid adverse reactions arising from the absorption of PVP-I and prevent the onset of peritonitis caused by microbial invasion of the peritoneal cavity.
TI  - Infection after spinal fusion for pediatric spinal deformity: thirty years of experience at a single institution.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, consecutive case study of 1571 pediatric patients  who underwent spinal deformity surgery and had minimum 2-year follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To identify (1) the rate of infection after pediatric spinal deformity surgery; (2) the number of surgeries required to treat a postoperative infection after a pediatric spinal deformity surgery; (3) the percentage of patients with a postoperative infection after pediatric spinal deformity surgery who require implant removal to quantify the effect of removal on the deformity; and (4) the microbiology of postoperative infections after pediatric spinal deformity surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several previous reports have discussed the rates of infection after spinal surgery for pediatric spinal deformity. No previous reports have quantified the rate and magnitude of deformity progression after infection in pediatric spinal deformity surgery. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of the medical records and radiographs of all children undergoing surgery for spinal deformity at the Shriners Hospital for Children in Chicago from January 1, 1975, to June 1, 2005. RESULTS: The rate of infection varied based on underlying diagnosis: idiopathic scoliosis 0.5%, myelomeningocele 19.2%, myopathies 4.3%, and cerebral palsy 11.2%. On average, 2 surgeries were required to eradicate the infection. Approximately half of the patients required removal of the instrumentation to treat their infection. Forty-four percent of patients who developed an infection had significant progression of their deformity, with an average increase in deformity magnitude of 27 degrees. Implant removal predisposed patients to progression of deformity. The 3 most common organisms in order were Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Infection after spinal deformity in idiopathic scoliosis is rare but is relatively common in neuromuscular conditions. Eradication of infection can be expected, but implant removal is often required. Should implants be totally removed, significant progression of the deformity is possible.
TI  - [Analysis and clinical implication of upper urinary tract stone's bacterial spectrum].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the pathogenic bacterial's distribution and the drug resistance in the upper urinary tract stones, and to provide the information for choosing suitable antibiotics. METHODS: Stone samples were taken for culture and for drug sensitivity test in 146 patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy between April 2007 and October 2008, and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Pathogens presented in 72 (49.3%) patients. There were 70 (86.4%) Gram-negative bacteria strains. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae were the predominant bacteria, accounted for 30.9%(25 strains), 23.5% (19 strains) and 12.3% (10 strains), respectively. There were 10 (12.3%) Gram-positive bacteria strains, the predominant bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis (6 strains), accounting for 7.4%. And there was 1 fungi strain (1.2%). Resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (88.7%), ceftriaxone (81.3%) and ciprofloxacin (67.5%) was most commonly found in pathogen, and the rate of resistance to amikacin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were 8.6%, 10.0%, 10.0%, respectively. Erythromycylamine, teicoplanin, SMZ-TMP, nitrofurantoin were sensitive to Gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial's distribution of upper urinary tract stones are multiple, and the majority pathogen is Gram-negative bacteria. A big variant resistance is found among different bacterium. The suitable antibiotics should be chosen according to the different bacterium in the patients who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
TI  - Essential oil from the underground parts of Laserpitium zernyi: potential source  of alpha-bisabolol and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil from the underground parts (roots and rhizomes) of Laserpitium zernyi Hayek (Apiaceae) were investigated. The pale blue essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-three compounds were identified (94.3% of total oil). The main constituent, beside alpha-pinene (31.6%) was alpha-bisabolol (30.9%), so this oil may be a novel potential natural source of this sesquiterpene alcohol. The antimicrobial activity was tested using the microdilution method against Gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram (-) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli), and two strains of yeast (Candida albicans). L. zernyi oil showed significant antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis, S. aureus and M. luteus, but lower activities against the other tested strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of guanidinylated neomycin B- and kanamycin A-derived amphiphilic lipid conjugates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neomycin B exhibits poor antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while kanamycin A shows weak activity against MRSA, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and P. aeruginosa. The main purpose of this work was to study whether lipid conjugation of guanidinylated neomycin B- and kanamycin A-derived cationic headgroups could restore antibacterial activity against neomycin B- and kanamycin A-resistant strains, while retaining antibacterial activity against non-resistant strains. METHODS: Seven polyguanidinylated neomycin B-lipids differing in the nature of the lipid tail and two cationic kanamycin A-lipids were prepared, and their in vitro activity was assessed against a variety of neomycin B- and kanamycin A-resistant and neomycin B- and kanamycin A-non-resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. RESULTS: Conjugation of neomycin B- and kanamycin A-derived polyamine or polyguanidinylated headgroups to hydrophobic C16 or C20 lipid tails restored the anti-MRSA activity of both aminoglycosides and the anti-MRSE activity of kanamycin A. Polyguanidinylation of the neomycin B-derived headgroup lowers the hydrophobic requirement of the lipid tail segment to provide broad-spectrum antibacterial activity from C16 to C12. Moreover, guanidinylation of the polycationic headgroup in neomycin B-derived cationic lipids enhances antibacterial activity against a neomycin B-, kanamycin A- and gentamicin-resistant P. aeruginosa strain, and reduces haemolytic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lipid conjugation of neomycin B- and kanamycin A-derived cationic lipids provides a general tool to enhance the antibacterial activity of these two aminoglycosides against resistant strains.
TI  - Time-kill assay results for a linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser for lid hygiene.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill testing was performed for a linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pityrosporum ovale to evaluate its efficacy. METHODS: An inoculum of 1 mL of each test organism culture was added to 49 mL of test cleanser. At 30 seconds and 1 minute, 1 mL of sample was removed from each test mixture and added to 9 mL of neutralizer. Five milliliters of aliquots were incubated for 48 hours and counted for colony-forming units. Ten percent povidone-iodine was used as a control. RESULTS: At 30 seconds, the linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser produced a 99.9999% reduction in P. aeruginosa, a 99.999% reduction in E. coli, a 99.99% reduction in M. catarrhalis and S. marcescens, a 99.9% reduction in MRSA, a 99.2% reduction in S. epidermidis, and a 97.5% reduction in S. aureus. At 1 minute, this cleanser achieved a 95.8% reduction in P. ovale. At 30 seconds, povidone-iodine produced a 99.9999% reduction in P. aeruginosa and M. catarrhalis, a 99.999% reduction in S. marcescens and a 94.9% reduction in S. epidermidis. At 1 minute, 10% povidone-iodine produced a 93.8% reduction in E coli but failed to produce a 1-log reduction in S. aureus or MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: This linalool-hinokitiol-based eyelid cleanser may be helpful in the outpatient setting for patients with presurgical, blepharitis, punctal plug and dry eye, and in the inpatient setting for patients who are allergic to iodine, or as an adjunct to povidone-iodine.
TI  - New 6-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines and [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b]  [1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-ones: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity evaluation.
AB  - (4-X-Phenylsulfonyl)phenyl] containing 6-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines and [1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazin-6-ones were synthesized by intermolecular condensation of 2-chloro-N-phenylacetamide, 2-chloroacetic acid, oxalylchloride and bromo-diethylmalonate with 4-amino-5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiols (X = H, Cl, Br). The structures of newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analysis and IR, NMR spectral data. All the compounds were screened for their antibacterial activities. Some of them exhibited good activities against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922.
TI  - Common wound colonizers in patients with epidermolysis bullosa.
AB  - One of the major morbidities of patients with epidermolysis bullosa is the tendency to develop chronic wounds, which predisposes them to multiple complications including life-threatening infections, failure to thrive, and squamous cell carcinomas. Chronic wounds frequently become colonized with bacteria, and we sought to identify the most common microorganisms isolated on cultures from patients with epidermolysis bullosa. We conducted a retrospective review of positive wound, nasal, and blood cultures, including bacterial, fungal and viral, in 30 patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., diptheroids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida sp. were the most commonly isolated microorganisms in wound cultures from our epidermolysis bullosa patients. Two patients had viral cultures that grew herpes simplex virus type-1. Bacterial colonization of chronic wounds can lead to infections and may also impact wound healing. Results from this study provide data on which to base empiric antibiotic choice in patients with epidermolysis bullosa when needed and may be useful in planning strategies for decolonization and improved wound healing in this population.
TI  - Ocular surface bacterial colonisation in sedated intensive care unit patients.
AB  - We investigated the time-dependent ocular surface bacterial colonisation of sedated patients hospitalised in an intensive care unit and aimed to evaluate whether proper topical antibiotic prophylaxis could prohibit corneal infection. The study lasted 12 months and included 134 patients undergoing sedation and mechanical respiratory support for various medical reasons. Patients hospitalised for less than seven days and those with pre-existing ocular surface pathology were excluded. All patients were examined on admission by inspecting the cornea for erosions. Followup examinations were performed each subsequent day. Cultures were also obtained from the conjunctival sac of both eyes on admission and every seventh day until the end of sedation. Standard laboratory techniques were used for isolation, identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of bacteria. Antibiotic treatment for prophylaxis was administered accordingly. Analysis was carried out for 70 patients. Duration of sedation ranged from seven to 122 days. Fifty-four (77%) patients were colonised by at least one bacterial species other than normal flora within seven to 42 days. Multiple bacteria were isolated from 28 patients undergoing prolonged sedation. Prevalent isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Infectious keratitis was prohibited in all cases. Ocular surface of long-term sedated patients was found to be colonised by various bacterial species and their isolation was closely associated with the time period of hospitalisation. The results of this study suggest that the early identification of ocular surface bacteria colonisation and the administration of topical antibiotics for prophylaxis can prohibit corneal infection in these patients.
TI  - The diversity of antibacterial compounds of Terminalia species (Combretaceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of acetone, hexane, dichloromethane leaf extract of five Terminalia species (Terminalia alata Heyne ex Roth., Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wt. and Am., Terminalia bellerica (Gaertn.) Roxb., Terminalia catappa L. and Terminalia chebula Retz.) were tested by Agar-well-diffusion method against human pathogens E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The Rf values and relative activities of separated compounds were tested. Hexane and dichloromethane extracts have shown more antibacterial components than the acetone extract indicating the non-polar character of the antibacterial compounds. The non-polar character of the antibacterial compounds was confirmed from the Rf values. It indicated that the antibacterial activity was not due to tannins. Terminalia catappa found to possess the compounds which are more antibacterial. Terminalia arjuna and T. catappa plants were found most promising for isolating antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial of new anthraquinone derivatives incorporating pyrazole moiety.
AB  - Treatment of 2-cyano-N-(9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydro-anthracen-2-yl)-acetamide (1) with phenyl isothiocyanate/dimethylsulphate afforded the corresponding ketene N,S-acetal 2 which upon treatment with hydrazine hydrate and 4-aminoantipyrine afforded the pyrazolo derivatives 3 and 4, respectively. 3-aminopyrazole derivative 3 was utilized as key intermediate for the synthesis of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine 5, pentaaza-as-indacene 6, triaza-cyclopenta[c]phenanthrene 7, pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 8, 9 and (dimethyl-pyrrol-1-yl)pyrazole 10 derivatives. Furthermore, treatment of 1 with DMF/DMA gave the corresponding acrylamide derivative 11 which upon treatment with hydrazine hydrate afforded the corresponding 3-aminopyrazole derivative 12. Moreover, coupling of 1 with 4,6-dimethyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-3-diazonium chloride gave the hydrazone derivative 13 which upon cyclization with acetic acid afforded the corresponding pentaaza-fluorene derivative 14. Representative compounds of the synthesized products were evaluated as antimicrobial agents. Some of these compounds exhibited promising activities.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of photo-activated riboflavin using UVA.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial effect of NSAIDS on clinical isolates of urinary tract infection and diabetic foot infection.
AB  - Non Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDS) are a group of chemically dissimilar agents that have primary effect of inhibition of prostaglandin's synthesis. Aspirin (Acetyl Salicylic Acid) is used as an analgesic, anti pyretic, anti-inflammatory agent and also have an anticoagulant effect. Tylenol (acetaminophen) is used as pain reliever. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Aspirin and Tylenol against clinical isolates of urinary tract infection (UTI) and diabetic foot infections. A total of 100 clinical isolates were analyzed. Out of these 50 were urine samples from diabetic patients with UTI and 50 pus samples from diabetic foot infection. Bacteriological study was done by inoculating urine samples on Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte deficient (CLED) media. Pus samples were inoculated on Blood agar and MacConkey's agar. Identification was done by colony characteristics, gram staining and standard biochemical tests and Quick Test Strip (QTS-20) DESTO Laboratories, Karachi. Antibacterial effect of Aspirin and Tylenol were tested against 100 clinical isolates by Replica plate method, Agar well diffusion method and tube dilution method. Concentrations of Aspirin and Tylenol (10 microg, 50 microg, 100 microg, 500 microg, 1000 microg) were made in Muller Hinton media. Bacteria isolated from urine samples were Escherichia coli 30%, Staphylococcus aureus 20%, Enterococcus faecalis 10%, S. saprophyticus 10%, Proteus spp. 6%, Pseudomonas spp. 6%, S. pyogenes 6%, S. agalactiae 6%, S. epidermidis 4%, and Klebsiella spp. 2%. Bacteria isolated from pus samples were S. aureus 30%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18%, S. epidermidis 14%, Klebsiella pneumonia 12%, Proteus mirabilis 12%, E. coli 10%, P. vulgaris 4%. Aspirin was effective at 100-500 microg concentration against all isolates. Tylenol has marked effect on pathogens at 100 microg concentration. Aspirin and Tylenol along with analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-inflammatory properties also have marked anti bacterial effect on isolates from UTI and Diabetic foot infections and inhibits the growth of both gram negative and gram positive bacteria, and both can be used synergistically with antibiotics for effective treatment.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and outcome of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis in Qatar.
AB  - Peritoneal dialysis therapy rapidly expanded in Qatar during the last decade. Peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis remains the leading cause of morbidity and technique failure. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis in Qatar, during a five year study period. The records of all patients on maintenance peritoneal dialysis from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007 were reviewed. Episodes of peritonitis, microbial profile, clinical course and outcome were analyzed. A total of 241 patients were included, males represented 74%, the mean age was 53 + or - 13 years, and 48% of patients were diabetics. During the study period 118 episode of peritonitis were observed, with a mean incidence of 0.24 + or - 0.1 episodes per patient year. Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 40% of episodes, with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hemolyticus being the commonest organisms, isolated in 21% and 9% of infections, respectively. Escherichia coli was the commonest Gram-negative organism and was isolated in 9% of peritonitis episodes, whereas culture-negative peritonitis represented 28% of all diagnosed infections. Seventy nine percent of peritonitis episodes completely resolved with the use of intraperitoneal antimicrobial therapy. Peritoneal dialysis catheters were removed in 19% of episodes. Peritonitis related mortality rate was 3%, and it was due to Candida spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite its low incidence, peritonitis remained the leading cause of patient dropout. Prompt diagnosis and prudent management as well as psychological support to the patients remained essential to reduce the incidence of technique failure following peritonitis episodes.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of benzyl-[3-(benzylamino-methyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-amine derivatives.
AB  - A series of benzyl-[3-(benzylamino-methyl)-cyclohexylmethyl]-amine derivatives with different substitution pattern on the aromatic ring have been prepared and evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains. Most of the compounds exhibit potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis while compounds 6l and 6m showed antibacterial activity against all the four bacterial strains with MIC values ranging from 0.002 to 0.016 microg/mL and no hemolytic activity up to 512 microg/mL in mammalian erythrocytes was observed.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles produced by chemical  reduction method.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The most prominent nanoparticles for medical uses are nanosilver particles which are famous for their high anti-microbial activity. Silver ion has been known as a metal ion that exhibit anti-mold, anti-microbial and anti-algal properties for a long time. In particular, it is widely used as silver nitrate aqueous solution which has disinfecting and sterilizing actions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity as well as physical properties of the silver nanoparticles prepared by chemical reduction method. METHODS: Silver nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by reduction of silver nitrate in the presence of a reducing agent and also poly [N-vinylpyrolidone] (PVP) as a stabilizer. Two kinds of NPs were synthesized by ethylene glycol (EG) and glucose as reducing agent. The nanostructure and particle size of silver NPs were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle analyzer (LPA). The formations of the silver NPs were monitored using ultraviolet- visible spectroscopy. The anti-bacterial activity of silver NPs were assessed by determination of their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against the Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) as well as Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The silver nanoparticles were spherical with particle size between 10 to 250 nm. Analysis of the theoretical (Mie light scattering theory) and experimental results showed that the silver NPs in colloidal solution had a diameter of approximately 50 nm. Both colloidal silver NPs showed high anti-bacterial activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. Glucose nanosilver colloids showed a shorter killing time against most of the tested bacteria which could be due to their nanostructures and uniform size distribution patterns.
TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy assessment of multi-use solution to disinfect hydrophilic  contact lens, in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of disinfecting solutions in hydrophilic contact lenses (CL). METHODS: Two multi-use solutions denominated solution A (0.001% polyquaternium-1 and 0.0005% myristamidopropyl dimethylamine) and solution B (0.0001% polyaminopropyl biguanide) were used. The solutions were tested in hydrophilic contact lenses infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27583), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC1226), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25923) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231) and the decrease in microorganisms growth after the hydrophilic contact lenses were cleaned with the respective solutions was verified. The manufacture's instructions were followed. RESULTS: A decrease of 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and a decrease 100% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was observed. CONCLUSION: The solutions decreased the amount of microorganisms tested.
TI  - Gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of volatiles obtained by four different techniques from Salvia rosifolia Sm., and evaluation for biological activity.
AB  - Four different isolation techniques, conventional hydrodistillation (HD), microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MWHD), microdistillation (MD) and micro-steam distillation-solid-phase microextraction (MSD-SPME), have been used to analyze the volatile constituents from the aerial parts of Salvia rosifolia Sm. by gas chromatography and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. HD and MWHD techniques produced quantitatively (yield, 0.39% and 0.40%) and qualitatively (aromatic profile) similar essential oils. alpha-Pinene (15.7-34.8%), 1,8-cineole (16.6-25.1%), beta-pinene (6.7-13.5%), beta-caryophyllene (1.4-5.0%) and caryophyllene oxide (1.4-4.4%) were identified as major constituents of this Turkish endemic species. Besides, the hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia was evaluated for antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. The hydrodistilled oil of S. rosifolia showed antibacterial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) with a MIC value of 125microg/mL. Other human pathogenic microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans) were also inhibited within a moderate range (MIC=125-1000microg/mL). Antifungal activity of the oil was also observed against the strawberry anthracnose-causing fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. No cytotoxicity was observed for S. rosifolia oil up to 25mg/mL against malignant melanoma, epidermal, ductal and ovary carcinoma.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of light-activated polyurethane containing indocyanine green.
AB  - The aim of this study was to produce novel antimicrobial polymers containing the  light-activated antimicrobial agent indocyanine green (ICG). The novel materials were prepared by swelling polyurethane in acetone containing water and ICG, followed by solvent evaporation. The uptake of ICG was dependent upon the ratio of acetone to water. Only at a ratio of 99 parts acetone to 1 part water was there any substantial colouration of the samples. When exposed to laser light from the near infrared spectrum (808 nm), polyurethane-containing ICG exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria; a 2 log(1)(0) reduction was achieved against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis after 15 min exposure, corresponding to an energy dose of 31.83 J delivered at an energy density of 31.83 J/cm(2). Under the same conditions, Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) appeared to be less susceptible, the viable count being reduced by 0.5 log(1)(0). Some of the physical properties of the resulting material were also investigated and it was found that the elasticity (Young's modulus) was reduced by approximately 60%. Furthermore, when the ICG-containing polymer was stretched, the breaking point occurred when the elongation was 6.7 times the initial value, while ICG-free polyurethane samples did not break following a 7-fold elongation. The contact angles for water droplets revealed that the ICG-containing polymer was more hydrophobic than untreated polyurethane. The results of this study show that ICG can be embedded in polyurethane to produce materials which when irradiated with near-infrared light can exert a bactericidal effect particularly against MRSA and S. epidermidis. Such materials may be useful for preparing intravenous catheters, which are often colonized by such organisms.
TI  - Postoperative surgical site infection following acetabular fracture fixation.
AB  - Postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) in orthopaedic trauma surgery is uncommon, but can present serious complications. This study was designed to assess the prevalence of, and to identify the risk factors for, SSI following acetabular fracture open reduction and internal fixation. A total of 326 consecutive patients who underwent acetabular fracture surgery were retrospectively reviewed. There were 17 patients (5.2%) who developed a SSI, including 10 deep infections and 7 superficial infections. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common causative pathogens in 9 patients, and was Methicillin-resistant in 3 patients. Enterococcus faecalis was found in 6 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 patients, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterbacter cloacae in 2 patients each. Fourteen of 17 patients developed their infection within 4 weeks after the fixation. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the SSI group had statistically significant higher Injury Severity Score, longer intensive care unit (ICU) stays, larger amount of packed red blood cells transfused, longer operative time, larger estimated operative blood loss, higher body mass index (BMI), more frequent performance of combined approach, embolisation of internal iliac arteries, association of urinary tract injury, and Morel-Lavallee lesion compared to the no SSI group. Multivariate analysis using these 10 parameters showed that BMI, ICU stay, and Morel-Lavallee lesion were independently significant risk factors for SSI. To reduce the incidence of SSI following acetabular fracture surgery, special attention should be directed at the care of obese patients, patients requiring ICU care, and patients with associated Morel-Lavallee lesions.
TI  - [Problem of infections at ENT Department of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections at ENT wards constitute an essential clinical, organizational and economic issue. AIM: The purpose of this work was to present the problem of infections at ENT Clinic of Poznan University of Medical Sciences based on the material from 2006-2007 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 2006-2007 in The Department of Otolaryngology in Poznan there were treated 7052 patients. During that time 476 biological samples were taken to carry out a bacteriological examination. They came from: 74 postoperative wounds, 43 tracheotomy areas, 29 tracheoesophageal fistulas, 9 salivary fistulas, 105 ears, 71 noses, pharynxes and oral cavities, 44 body fluids, 18 paranasal sinuses, 11 central venous catheter areas, 23 urine samples, some constituted BAL, sputum, cyst content, materials from decubitus ulcer and gastrostomies areas. 21 materials were taken from abscesses and phlegmons, 32 from patients with purulent complications of chronic otitis media, 18 from patients with complications of chronic sinusitis and in 1 case there was taken in hospital conditions peritonsillar abscess content. RESULTS: 119 biological samples were aseptic, in 43 samples there were no pathological cultures, in 314 samples pathological bacterial flora was found. The most often isolated pathogens constituted: in postoperative wounds-Staphylococcus epidermidis, in tracheotomy areas-Enterococcus faecalis, in tracheoesophagal fistulas-Streptococcus viridans, in ears-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in materials from noses, pharynxes and oral cavities-Staphylococcus aureus, while in materials from abscesses, paranasal sinuses and central venous catheter areas-Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: All cases were analyzed in detail. There was made a correlation between isolated pathogens and: a kind of pathology, surgical procedure, general patient condition, length of hospitalization.
TI  - Production of rhamnolipid biosurfactants by Pseudomonas aeruginosa DS10-129 in a  microfluidic bioreactor.
AB  - A low-cost microBR (microbioreactor) made from PTFE [poly(tetrafluoroethylene)] was used to cultivate a model organism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DS10-129. The progress of bioprocessing was monitored by comparing the growth of the organism in a microBR, a conventional bench scale bioreactor and a shake flask. Under the microBR conditions, the organism produced 23 mg/ml of pyocyanin that had antimicrobial effects against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas teessidea and Pseudomonas clemancea. Furthermore, it produced a total of 106 microg/ml of effective biosurfactants consisting of dirhamnolipids (RL2) and monorhamnolipids (RL1). The biosurfactants reduced the surface tension of distilled water from 72 to 27.9 mN/m and emulsified kerosene by 71.30%. The pyocyanin and rhamnolipids were produced during the exponential and stationary phases of growth respectively. The results of the microBR were comparable to those obtained using conventional scale methods.
TI  - Development and testing of a novel microcantilever technique for measuring the cohesive strength of intact biofilms.
AB  - Cohesive strength is an important parameter for understanding and modeling the mechanics of biomass detachment from bacterial biofilms. It is challenging to measure the mechanical properties of biofilms, however, because biofilms may desiccate when removed from liquid medium and they are inherently fragile. Poppele and Hozalski (Poppele and Hozalski, 2003, J Microb Methods 55:607-615) presented a microcantilever method for measuring the tensile strength of detached biofilm fragments while submersed in liquid medium. Here we present a modification of the microcantilever method to quantify the strength of intact bacterial biofilms. Initial testing was performed on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and on Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms grown in rotating disk reactors. The cohesive strength values were highly variable (i.e., coefficients of variation ranging from 71% to 143%) and ranged from 59 to 18,900 Pa for the P. aeruginosa biofilms and from 61 to 5,840 Pa for the S. epidermidis biofilms. The biofilms also appeared to be isotropic as strength did not vary with angle of testing relative to the direction of applied shear. Strength testing using both the intact and fragment methods was performed on five samples of P. aeruginosa biofilms, and the strength populations were not from the same distribution in three cases. Equivalent diameters for the fragments detached from biofilms during strength testing ranged from 5 to 500 microm, which is within the range of size of biofilm fragments observed in the effluents of lab-scale and full-scale bioreactors. The microcantilever is a simple yet powerful tool for measuring the cohesive strength of intact biofilms at a relevant scale.
TI  - In vitro susceptibility of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis in Northern  India and to determine the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of bacterial keratitis isolates to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones. METHODS: Laboratory records of all consecutive cases of clinically suspected bacterial corneal ulcers were retrospectively reviewed. Data noted included microorganism isolated and antibiotic culture sensitivity to cefazolin, tobramycin, gatifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. In vitro susceptibility toward individual antibiotics was determined and compared with the potential in vitro susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin, cefazolin-gatifloxacin, and cefazolin-moxifloxacin combinations. RESULTS: A total of 292 bacterial isolates were identified. Of these, 255 (87.3%) were Gram-positive and 37 (12.7%) were Gram-negative. Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=227, 77.7%) was the most common organism. Overall susceptibility of isolates was 95.52% to gatifloxacin, 92.83% to moxifloxacin, 90.07% to tobramycin, and 83.56% to cefazolin (p<0.000). Organisms which showed resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities to gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were comparable with each other (p=0.312) and with potential susceptibilities to cefazolin-tobramycin (p=0.479), gatifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.134), and moxifloxacin-cefazolin (p=0.412) combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Monotherapy with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin can be an effective alternative to cefazolin-tobramycin combination as a first-line empirical therapy for bacterial keratitis. The addition of cefazolin to a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone is of limited value.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial efficacy of photo-activated riboflavin using ultraviolet light (UVA).
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of photo-activated riboflavin  using Ultraviolet A (UVA) on three bacterial strains commonly detected in keratitis. METHODS: Three bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were cultured on blood/hematin-agar plates and dispersed in PBS. Dispersion was done of 10 microl of bacterial stock-solutions in 90 microl of RPMI, where different riboflavin molarities had been added, to achieve a bacterial concentration of 1-4 x 10 (4)/ml. Riboflavin end molarities before illumination were 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 microM. Each solution had a negative control. The solutions were illuminated with UVA (365 nm) for 30 minutes (5.4 J/cm(2)) and then continued for a total time of 60 minutes (10.8 J/cm(2)). A count of CFU was conducted after incubation and results compared. RESULTS: In all tested strains, a slight decrease of bacteria was seen when exposed to UV for 30 minutes. A doubling of the UV dose showed a marked decrease of bacterial count in all bacteria tested. The combination of UV and riboflavin showed a more extensive reduction of CFU, confirming an interaction effect between UV and riboflavin. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin photo-activation using UVA (365 nm) can achieve an extensive eradication of bacteria, and the combination is more potent in reducing bacterial number than UV alone.
TI  - Effect of ciprofloxacin and N-acetylcysteine on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on ureteral stent surfaces.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ciprofloxacin (CIP), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) alone and in combination on biofilm production and pre-formed mature biofilms on ureteral stent surfaces. Two strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebseilla pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris, recently isolated from patients undergoing ureteral stent removal and shown to be capable of biofilm production, were used in this study. The inhibitory effects of ciprofloxacin, N-acetylcysteine and ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine combination were determined by static adherence assay. Ciprofloxacin (MIC and 2 MIC) and N-acetylcysteine (2 and 4 mg/ml) inhibited biofilm production by > or = 60% in all tested microorganisms. Disruption of pre-formed biofilms of all tested microorganisms was found to be > or = 78% in the presence of ciprofloxacin (MIC and 2 MIC) and > or = 62% in the presence of N-acetylcysteine (2 and 4 mg/ml), compared to controls. Ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine showed the highest inhibitory effect on biofilm production (94-100%) and the highest disruptive effect on the pre-formed biofilms (86-100%) in comparison to controls. N-acetylcysteine was found to increase the therapeutic efficacy of ciprofloxacin by degrading the extracellular polysaccharide matrix of biofilms. These data are statistically significant. The inhibitory effects of ciprofloxacin and N-acetylcysteine on biofilm production were also verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM). In conclusion, Ciprofloxacin/N-acetylcysteine combinations have the highest inhibitory effect on biofilm production and the highest ability to eradicate pre-formed mature biofilms.
TI  - The relationship between the nanostructure of titanium surfaces and bacterial attachment.
AB  - Infection of an orthopedic prosthesis is undesirable and causes a decrease in the success rate of an implant. Reducing the adhesion of a broad range of bacteria could be an attractive means to decrease infection and allow for subsequent appropriate tissue integration with the biomaterial surface. In this in vitro study, nanometer sized topographical features of titanium (Ti) surfaces, which have been previously shown to enhance select protein adsorption and subsequent osteoblast (bone-forming cell) functions, were investigated as a means to also reduce bacteria adhesion. This study examined the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on conventional Ti, nanorough Ti produced by electron beam evaporation, and nanotubular and nanotextured Ti produced by two different anodization processes. This study found that compared to conventional (nano-smooth) Ti, the nanorough Ti surfaces produced by electron beam evaporation decreased the adherence of all of the aforementioned bacteria the most. The conventional and nanorough Ti surfaces were found to have crystalline TiO(2) while the nanotubular and nanotextured Ti surfaces were found to be amorphous. The surface chemistries were similar for the conventional and nanorough Ti while the anodized Ti surfaces contained fluorine. Therefore, the results of this study in vitro study demonstrated that certain nanometer sized Ti topographies may be useful for reducing bacteria adhesion while promoting bone tissue formation and, thus, should be further studied for improving the efficacy of Ti-based orthopedic implants.
TI  - Characterization of bacterial flora in persistent apical periodontitis lesions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microorganisms are able to survive and induce persistent infection  in periapical tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of the microflora of persistent apical periodontitis lesions. METHODS: Twenty apical lesion samples were obtained from 20 patients with chronic apical periodontitis by root end surgery and processed using aerobic or anaerobic culture techniques. All isolated strains were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four strains were isolated, belonging to 31 bacterial species obtained from the 20 apical lesions that were isolated. The majority of the strains were facultative anaerobes (51.6%). Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Fusobacterium nucleatum were isolated from 16.2, 9.5, 6.8 and 5.4% of the samples, respectively. Fifteen samples harboured more than one species. The predominant association was P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum. CONCLUSION: The microbiota of persistent apical periodontitis lesions is composed by diverse types of microorganisms with biofilm-forming capacity, including P. acnes, S. epidermidis and F. nucleatum.
TI  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis. A rare cause of adult airway stenosis.
AB  - Bacterial tracheobronchitis is a rare cause of airway stenosis in adults. This report describes a 73-year-old woman with a recent history of polysialadenitis, who presented with severe airway obstruction due to infection and stenosis of tracheal and bronchial tissue. Tissue culture of the bronchial mucosa showed growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). Sputum culture showed growth of MRSE, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Enterococcus faecalis; the same organisms were cultured from the salivary glands. Tracheostomy and antibiotic therapy were effective in controlling the disease.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - Microneedle arrays allow lower microbial penetration than hypodermic needles in vitro.
AB  - METHODS: In this study we determined, for the first time, the ability of microorganisms to traverse microneedle-induced holes using two different in vitro models. RESULTS: When employing Silescol membranes, the numbers of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis crossing the membranes were an order of magnitude lower when the membranes were punctured by microneedles rather than a 21G hypodermic needle. Apart from the movement of C. albicans across hypodermic needle-punctured membranes, where 40.2% of the microbial load on control membranes permeated the barrier over 24 h, the numbers of permeating microorganisms was less than 5% of the original microbial load on control membranes. Experiments employing excised porcine skin and radiolabelled microorganisms showed that the numbers of microorganisms penetrating skin beyond the stratum corneum were approximately an order of magnitude greater than the numbers crossing Silescol membranes in the corresponding experiments. Approximately 10(3) cfu of each microorganism adhered to hypodermic needles during insertion. The numbers of microorganisms adhering to MN arrays were an order of magnitude higher in each case. CONCLUSION: We have shown here that microneedle puncture resulted in significantly less microbial penetration than did hypodermic needle puncture and that no microorganisms crossed the viable epidermis in microneedle-punctured skin, in contrast to needle-punctured skin. Given the antimicrobial properties of skin, it is, therefore, likely that application of microneedle arrays to skin in an appropriate manner would not cause either local or systemic infection in normal circumstances in immune-competent patients. In supporting widespread clinical use of microneedle-based delivery systems, appropriate animal studies are now needed to conclusively demonstrate this in vivo. Safety in patients will be enhanced by aseptic or sterile manufacture and by fabricating microneedles from self-disabling materials (e.g. dissolving or biodegradable polymers) to prevent inappropriate or accidental reuse.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - Metabolism of azo dyes by human skin microbiota.
AB  - Reduction of Methyl Red (MR) and Orange II (Or II) by 26 human skin bacterial species was monitored by a rapid spectrophotometric assay. The analysis indicated that skin bacteria, representing the genera Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Dermacoccus and Kocuria, were able to reduce MR by 74-100 % in 24 h, with only three species unable to reduce completely the dye in that time. Among the species tested, only Corynebacterium xerosis was unable to reduce Or II to any degree by 24 h, and only Staphylococcus delphini, Staphylococcus sciuri subsp. sciuri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were able to reduce completely this dye within 24 h. MR reduction started with early-exponential growth in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and around late-exponential/early-stationary growth in P. aeruginosa. Reduction of Or II, Ponceau S and Ponceau BS started during late-exponential/early-stationary growth for all three species. Using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses, MR metabolites produced by Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa were identified as N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 2-aminobenzoic acid. Searches of available genomic and proteomic data revealed that at least four of the staphylococci in this study, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staph. epidermidis, Staphylococcus cohnii and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, have hypothetical genes with 77, 76, 75 and 74 % sequence identity to azo1 encoding an azoreductase from Staph. aureus and hypothetical proteins with 82, 80, 72 and 74 % identity to Azo1, respectively. In addition, Staphylococcus capitis has a protein with 79 % identity to Azo1. Western analysis detected proteins similar to Azo1 in all the staphylococci tested, except Staph. delphini, Staph. sciuri subsp. sciuri and Staphylococcus auricularis. The data presented in this report will be useful in the risk assessment process for evaluation of public exposure to products containing these dyes.
TI  - In vitro assessment of the antibiotic efficacy of contrast media and antibiotics  and their combinations at various dilutions.
AB  - Discography is a controversial diagnostic procedure involving the injection of radiographic contrast medium (RCM) into the intervertebral disc. Iatrogenic bacterial discitis is a rare but serious complication. The intervention has been increasingly performed in our patients here in the United Arab Emirates. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic administration can reduce post-interventional discitis; however, this may favour the development of bacterial resistance. Direct intradiscal injection of an antibiotic together with the RCM is a potential alternative. To date, there has been only one study on the efficacy of antibiotics added to an RCM. Equally, there are only limited data regarding the potential direct effect of RCM on bacterial growth. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the efficacy of antibiotics is affected when RCM are added. In an in vitro study, the effect of non-ionic RCM on the growth of five laboratory bacterial strains, alone and in combination with three broad-spectrum antimicrobials, was tested. Bacterial growth was assessed in the absence and the presence of RCM, antibiotics and their combinations. All three RCM alone demonstrated some inhibition of bacterial growth at high concentrations. In the presence of the RCM, all three antibiotics retained their inhibitory effect on bacterial growth. In conclusion, our in vitro experiments did not reveal any changes in the antimicrobial efficacy of the three antibiotics in the presence of the three tested RCM. Subsequent clinical trials will need to assess whether intradiscal antibiotic administration may be a suitable substitute for, or a supplement to, prophylactic systemic antibiotics before discography.
TI  - Constituents of the leaves of Magnolia ovata.
AB  - Two new lignans, magnovatins A (1) and B (2), along with nine known compounds, were isolated from the leaves of Magnolia ovata. The known compounds were identified as acuminatin (3), licarin A (4), kadsurenin M, 4-O-demethylkadsurenin M, oleiferin A, oleiferin C, spathulenol, parthenolide, and 11,13-dehydrocompressanolide. In addition, compounds 1 and 2 yielded four new derivatives (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b). The structures of the new compounds were established on the basis of spectrometric data evaluation. Free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities of the major compunds 1, 3, and 4 were investigated.
TI  - Aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit staphylococcal and enterococcal biofilm formation.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the leading causative agents of indwelling medical device infections because of their ability to form biofilms on artificial surfaces. Here we describe the antibiofilm activity of a class of small molecules, the aryl rhodanines, which specifically inhibit biofilm formation of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and E. gallinarum but not the gram-negative species Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The aryl rhodanines do not exhibit antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial strains tested and are not cytotoxic against HeLa cells. Preliminary mechanism-of-action studies revealed that the aryl rhodanines specifically inhibit the early stages of biofilm development by preventing attachment of the bacteria to surfaces.
TI  - Identification of pathogenic bacteria in blood cultures: comparison between conventional and PCR methods.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in a survey in a medical center. A PCR method for identification of these five most common pathogens in blood cultures was developed. A unique sequence was chosen for each pathogen and used for primer design. Sixty-one blood samples (from hospitalized patients) in which bacterial growth was detected were processed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods and by the PCR method. The results obtained by PCR were identical to those obtained by conventional methods in 93.4% of the cases. PCR failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 6.6% of the cases (mostly bacteria not included in the PCR cassette). Another group of eighty-eight blood samples from patients were processed immediately upon their arrival at the laboratory by taking aliquots for the PCR method. The blood sample bottles were processed in parallel by conventional methods. In 78.4% of the cases the results of both methods were identical. In 12.5% of the cases, PCR afforded identification of bacteria but conventional methods showed no bacteria in the sample. On the other hand, PCR afforded 9.1% negative results while conventional methods identified bacteria not included in the PCR cassette. It is concluded that the molecular method appears to be a specific and precise method for identifying pathogenic bacteria in blood samples.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of an iron-based hemostatic agent in vitro and in a rat  wound model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Topical hemostatic agents are currently employed on the battlefield for control of major hemorrhage and have potential for use in civilian settings. Some of these compounds may also be antibacterial. Given the behavior of these compounds, the purpose of this study was to assess the potential antibacterial properties of an iron oxyacid-based topical hemostatic agent against three problematic species of wound-contaminating microorganisms: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: Bacteria were treated in vitro with the test powder for 30 minutes and then assessed for viability. Long-term (8-hour) inhibition of bacterial growth was also examined. In vivo, a rat full-thickness 1-cm(2) skin wound was studied. Wounds were contaminated, treated, and then quantitatively cultured 24 hours later. RESULTS: The lethal dose for 99% of the organisms (LD(99)) for the compound against each organism ranged from 0.89 (+/-0.28) to 4.77 (+/-0.66) mg/mL (p < 0.05). The compound produced sustained inhibition over 8 hours at both 1 and 5 mg/mL (p < 0.05 for each), for P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. In vivo, activity was noted against only P. aeruginosa, with the largest magnitude reduction being on the order of 3-log colony-forming units (CFU; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The iron-based agent studied possesses significant in vitro and lesser in vivo antibacterial effects. Further optimization of the delivery, dosing, and evaluation of this agent in a larger animal model with more humanlike skin structures may reveal important wound effects beyond control of bleeding.
TI  - [Mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (MPC) in vitro, and to measure MPC of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the levofloxacin (LVF), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NFL), tobramycin (TOB) and chloromycetin (CHL) were determined by agar dilution method from National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The MPC were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with Mueller-Hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. With the software of SPSS 11.0, the datum such as the range of MIC, MPC, MIC90 and MPC90 were calculated, and the selection index (MPC90/ MI90) and mutant selection window (MSW) were obtained. RESULTS: The MI90 of LVF and TOB (4 mg/L) to Staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. CIP showed the lowest MIC90 (0.25 mg/L) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. The MIC90 of LVF to Staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L) were lower than other antibacterial agents. The MPC90, MSW and the MPC90/MIC90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. From all the datum, the MIC90 of CHL was the highest and the activity was the weakest. Although the activity of LVF was higher to every kind of bacteria, CIP had the highest activity antibacterial to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The capacity of CHL and TOB was weaker than Quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. LVF had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among Quinolones. CONCLUSION: LVF has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Flindersine isolated from the traditional medicinal plant, Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The leaves and root of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used as a folk medicine in India. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Toddalia asiatica leaves and isolated compound Flindersine were tested against bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against bacteria and fungi using disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The compound was confirmed using X-ray crystallography technique. RESULTS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in ethyl acetate extract. One active principle Flindersine (2,6-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-5H-pyrano [3,2-c] quinoline-5-one-9cl) was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract. The MIC values of the compound against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (31.25 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (62.5 microg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (62.5 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (31.25 microg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (250 microg/ml), Acinetobacter baumannii (125 microg/ml) and fungi Trichophyton rubrum 57 (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton simii (62.5 microg/ml), Epidermophyton floccosum (62.5 microg/ml), Magnaporthe grisea (250 microg/ml) and Candida albicans (250 microg/ml) were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity and isolated compound Flindersine showed moderate activity against bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Microbial contamination in the operating theatre: a study in a hospital in Baghdad.
AB  - Contamination of the operating theatre is a major cause of nosocomial infection.  This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of bacterial contamination of operating theatres in Al Imam Ali Hospital in Baghdad, and the source of contamination. From 1216 swabs collected from surfaces, equipment and antiseptic solutions from different operating theatres in 2001 and 2002, the rates of positive cultures were 3.7% in 2001 and 4.0% in 2002. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolate in 2001 followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas in 2002 coliform bacteria were the highest, followed by P. aeruginosa. No clear pattern of isolates was found in different types of operating theatres, although coliforms and P. aeruginosa were mostly found in the delivery theatre.
TI  - Interventions for control of Salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance of bacterial contamination. Before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. Five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and Staphylococcus intermedius. In separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. Turbidity of the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. New rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (P < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. We improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. Two of the compounds were most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with Salmonella Enteritidis. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of Salmonella Enteritidis before and after treatment. The most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared Salmonella Enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.
TI  - Silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  - The colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective antibacterial and antifouling coatings. There is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. In this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. The release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. These silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.
TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae) essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from the aerial parts of Marrubium incanum Desr. (Lamiaceae), obtained by hydrodistillation, was analyzed by GC and GC-MS. Forty-six compounds were identified, representing 96.3% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were (E)-caryophyllene (27.0%), germacrene D (26.2%) and bicyclogermacrene (11.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the agar diffusion and broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Micrococcus flavus ATCC 10240, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae NCIMB 9111, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans (ATCC 10259 and ATCC24433). The essential oil showed activity against all the microorganisms tested, but differences in microbial susceptibility were registered.
TI  - The antimicrobial peptide HBD-2 and the Toll-like receptors-2 and -4 are induced  in synovial membranes in case of septic arthritis.
AB  - Septic arthritis is frequently observed especially in immune-compromised or chronically diseased patients and leads to functional impairment due to tissue destruction. Recently, production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) was observed in articular cartilage after exposure to bacteria. This report examines the role of synoviocyte-derived AMPs in innate defense mechanisms of articular joints. Samples of healthy, low-grade synovialitis and septic synovial membranes were assessed for the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) and Toll-like receptor-2 and -4 (TLR) by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A stable synoviocyte line (K4IM) was used for in vitro experiments and assayed for endogenous HBD-2 and TLR production after exposure to inflammatory cytokines or bacterial supernatants by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, ELISA, and dual luciferase assay. Healthy human synovial membranes and cultured synoviocytes are able to produce HBD-2 and TLR-1-5 at basal expression levels. Samples of bacteria-colonized synovial membranes produce higher levels of HBD-2 when compared with samples of healthy tissues. K4IM synoviocytes exposed to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or proinflammatory cytokines demonstrated a clear HBD-2 transcription and protein induction. TLR-2 and -4 are known to have a critical role in the recognition of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in epithelia and are induced in mesenchymal synoviocytes after bacterial exposure on transcription and on protein level. This report demonstrates an unappreciated role of synovial membranes: samples of septic synovial membranes and cultured synoviocytes exposed to bacteria produce increased amounts of the AMP HBD-2 and the bacteria recognition receptors TLR-2 and -4. The induction of anti-inflammatory pathways in infected synoviocytes suggests involvement in intra-articular defense mechanisms.
TI  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracellular products inhibit staphylococcal growth, and  disrupt established biofilms produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Multiple bacterial species often coexist as communities, and compete for environmental resources. Here, we describe how an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, uses extracellular products to interact with the nosocomial pathogen Staphylococcus epidermidis. S. epidermidis biofilms and planktonic cultures were challenged with P. aeruginosa supernatant cultures overnight. Results indicated that quorum-sensing-controlled factors from P. aeruginosa supernatant inhibited S. epidermidis growth in planktonic cultures. We also found that P. aeruginosa extracellular products, mainly polysaccharides, disrupted established S. epidermidis biofilms. Cellulase-treated P. aeruginosa supernatant, and supernatant from pelA, pslF and pelApslBCD mutants, which are deficient in polysaccharide biosynthesis, diminished the disruption of S. epidermidis biofilms. In contrast, S. epidermidis supernatant in overnight cultures had no effect on established P. aeruginosa biofilms and planktonic growth. These findings reveal that P. aeruginosa extracellular products are important microbial competition factors that overcome competition with S. epidermidis, and the results may provide clues for the development of a novel strategy for controlling S. epidermidis biofilms.
TI  - Eradication of microorganisms embedded in biofilm by an ethanol-based catheter lock solution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interdialytic locking of catheters with antimicrobial agents is frequently used for preventing catheter-related infections, often associated with biofilm formation. We determined the bactericidal effect of 60% ethanol (ETOH) versus a 46.7% trisodium citrate (TSC) solution on biofilm embedded in silicone catheters. METHODS: Four- and 24-h biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans established in a microfermentor were exposed to ETOH and TSC for up to 24 h and the number of remaining viable microorganisms was determined. RESULTS: ETOH 60% was significantly more effective than 46.7% TSC in rapidly eradicating sessile cells from all microorganisms tested. A 20-min ETOH 60% treatment completely eradicated the Gram-negative bacilli and C. albicans biofilms, which initially contained up to 10(8) and 10(5) cells, respectively. Gram-positive cocci biofilms only showed a significant 2.6-4.3 log reduction in the initial viable counts after 20 min of ETOH 60% treatment, with eradication occurring after 30 min. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observation of ETOH-treated biofilm showed sparse cells with respiratory activity. TSC 46.7% eradicated none of the tested microorganisms. In contrast, ETOH 60% totally eradicated planktonic cells, whereas TSC had significant bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans after 20 min, 1 and 24 h, respectively, but none on the Staphylococcus species. CONCLUSIONS: This in vitro study demonstrates the superior antimicrobial activity of ETOH 60% in contrast to TSC 46.7% in eradicating biofilm formed on a silicon catheter. Hence, ethanol-based solution shows promise as a catheter lock solution.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antimicrobial activity and composition of essential oil from Tanacetum balsamita L. subsp. balsamita.
AB  - The aerial parts of Tanacetum balsamita subsp. balsamita were collected at full flowering stage from Tabriz, Iran. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Twenty seven components were identified, representing 99.2% of the total oil. Carvone (51.0%), beta-thujone (20.8%), 1,8-cineole (4.4%) and alpha-thujone (3.2%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of T. balsamita subsp. balsamita was studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, B. pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity. The in vitro toxicological study based on the MTT cytotoxicity assay on human fetal skin fibroblast (HFSF) and Monkey kidney (Vero) cell lines showed IC50 values of 2500 and 1250 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Copper(II) and uranyl(II) complexes with acylthiosemicarbazide: synthesis, characterization, antibacterial activity and effects on the growth of promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60.
AB  - New chelates of N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-butyl-thiosemicarbazide (X=H, Cl, Br) with Cu(2+) and UO(2)(2+) have been prepared and characterized by analytical and physico-chemical techniques such as magnetic susceptibility measurements, elemental and thermal analyses, electronic, ESR and IR spectral studies. Room temperature ESR spectra of Cu(II) complexes yield {g} values characteristic of distorted octahedral and pseudo-tetrahedral geometry. Infrared spectra indicate that complexes contain six-coordinate uranium atom with the ligand atoms arranged in an equatorial plane around the linear uranyl group. Effects of these complexes on the growth of human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL-60 and their antibacterial activity (against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775 strains) were studied comparatively with that of free ligands.
TI  - A new central venous catheter cap: decreased microbial growth and risk for catheter-related bloodstream infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related blood stream infection (CRBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and is a source of significant healthcare expenditures in patients that require central venous catheters for intravenous nutrition, chemotherapy, and other products. The source of many catheter-related infections is contamination of the catheter hub. Herein an antimicrobial catheter cap, the AB Cap is described. METHODS: The AB Cap device is a catheter cleaning device designed to keep needleless luer valves clean by encapsulating them in a cleaning solution. This device was evaluated using an in vitro model of hub contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans (C. albicans). Following hub contamination on days 1, 3, 5 and 7, saline was infused through the AB Cap and effluent collected from the efferent end. The effluent fluid was cultured for the index organisms, and allowed to incubate in culture for up to 7 days. Negative control caps were not contaminated and positive controls lacked cleaning solution and were contaminated. RESULTS: Microbial growth developed for all index organisms, and generally within 1 day of culture growth following the first day of contamination (day 1) in effluent from all positive controls, while no growth occurred in effluent from negative controls. No growth of any organism occurred in any of the test items after the first day of contamination. Growth of three organisms was detected in two of the three test AB Caps following contamination day 3, after 1-4 days of incubation. All organisms could be cultured in the effluent from two of the three test items at contamination day 5, generally by the second day of incubation. One test item remained free of growth for the entire test period except for one organism. By day 7, this particular test item grew an additional organism and the testing was concluded. All positive growth test items remained positive on subsequent inoculations during culture of newly obtained effluent with the exception of test item A, from which effluent following inoculation on day 3 showed growth of S. epidermidis and K. pneumonia, but no growth for these organisms from effluent obtained on inoculation day 5. In addition, effluent from test item C showed growth of C. albicans from inoculation day 5, but no growth from effluent obtained on inoculation day 7. The growth of S. epidermidis from effluent of test item A from the day 3 inoculation, and C. albicans from effluent of test items B and C did not occur until day 4 of incubation, suggesting a very small amount of contamination. CONCLUSION: An antimicrobial catheter cap is not a complete substitute for a proper catheter cleaning technique and other anti-infection precautions. However, we describe a unique catheter cap that significantly decreased the likelihood of a catheter-related infection from a non-cleaned cap in an in vitro model.
TI  - Bacteria, biofilm and honey: a study of the effects of honey on 'planktonic' and  biofilm-embedded chronic wound bacteria.
AB  - Chronically infected wounds are a costly source of suffering. An important factor in the failure of a sore to heal is the presence of multiple species of bacteria, living cooperatively in highly organized biofilms. The biofilm protects the bacteria from antibiotic therapy and the patient's immune response. Honey has been used as a wound treatment for millennia. The components responsible for its antibacterial properties are now being elucidated. The study aimed to determine the effects of different concentrations of 'Medihoney' therapeutic honey and Norwegian Forest Honey 1) on the real-time growth of typical chronic wound bacteria; 2) on biofilm formation; and 3) on the same bacteria already embedded in biofilm. Reference strains of MRSE, MRSA, ESBL Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with dilution series of the honeys in microtitre plates for 20 h. Growth of the bacteria was assessed by measuring optical density every 10 min. Growth curves, biofilm formation and minimum bactericidal concentrations are presented. Both honeys were bactericidal against all the strains of bacteria. Biofilm was penetrated by biocidal substances in honey. Reintroduction of honey as a conventional wound treatment may help improve individual wound care, prevent invasive infections, eliminate colonization, interrupt outbreaks and thereby preserve current antibiotic stocks.
TI  - Characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
AB  - The present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a R. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. The bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium, and Enterobacteriaceae (Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli) while Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. The Lactobacillus plantarum and L. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. While L. plantarum CRL 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. However, by using a MRS medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of H(2)O(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. The surface properties of Lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate ABO human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. This paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of Lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
TI  - Biofilm evidence and the microbial diversity of horse wounds.
AB  - Evidence of biofilms in human chronic wounds are thought to be responsible for preventing healing in a timely manner. However, biofilm evidence in horse wounds has not yet been documented. Consequently, this study aimed to determine whether biofilms could be detected in wounds, and to investigate the microbiology of chronic wounds in horses. Prior to analysis, wound surfaces were irrigated with 5 mL of sterile saline to remove debris. All wounds were swabbed twice (1 cm2 area) using sterile cotton-tipped swabs. In addition to this, 2 tissue biopsies were taken to investigate evidence of biofilm and the microbiology richness of the wounds. All swabs and 1 biopsy sample were transported to the laboratory in Robertson's cooked meat broth. Traditional culturable techniques and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis with PCR were utilized to identify common bacteria isolated in all wounds. Following analysis of a number of the biopsy samples, biofilms could be clearly seen. The most common bacteria isolated from each wound analysed included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus faecalis, and Providencia rettgeri. Sequencing of the 16S ribosmonal DNAs, selected on the basis of DGGE profiling, enabled identification of bacterial species not identified using culturable technology. This study is the first to identify biofilms in the chronic wounds of horses. In addition, this study also demonstrated the importance of combining DGGE-PCR with culture techniques to provide better microbiology analysis of chronic wounds.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - Clinical investigation of isolated bacteria from urinary tracts of hospitalized patients and their susceptibilities to antibiotics.
AB  - Complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are often difficult to treat, partly  because of the existence of isolated antibiotic-resistant strains. Even though the definition of UTI is determined by the quantity of cultured bacteria, it has been unclear if the quantity of cultured UTI bacteria affects their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Also, the gram stain is generally performed to assume the causative bacteria and their quantity before culture results can be obtained; therefore, we could start to use effective antibiotics if the relationship between bacterial quantity and resistance to antimicrobial agents were clear. We studied patients diagnosed as having complicated UTIs at the Urological Department in Kobe University Hospital between June 2002 and March 2003 and analyzed the relationships between the quantity of cultured bacteria and their antimicrobial MICs for antibiotics. The most commonly isolated bacteria were Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. There was no significant correlation between the quantity of cultured bacteria and antimicrobial MICs in all the bacteria and antibiotics that we tested, suggesting that resistant phenotype, but not inoculum of the organism, did determine resistance to antibiotics. In conclusion, our investigation suggested the total number of isolated bacteria in urine culture did not determine the MICs and that inoculum of the bacteria might be important for this determination.
TI  - [Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica].
AB  - Microbiological contamination and antimicrobial activity of cristalised cane sugar on some medically important microorganisms in Costa Rica. Unrefined cristalised cane sugar, obtained after the filtration and evaporation of sugar cane juice, is a nutritional product of traditional consumption in Costa Rica and other Neotropical countries. It has been used in the topic treatment of infected wounds, with satisfactory results even with some antibiotic-ressistant bacteria. We studied the microbiological quality of 50 commercial samples. The analyses included total aerobic and anaerobic bacteria plate count; aerobic and anaerobic spore count; mold and yeast count; total and fecal coliforms; and presence of Clostridium botulinum. The antimicrobial effect was tested for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger (Asni 06). Most of the samples (76%) presented counts lower than 100 CFU/g especially for sporulated forms (90% lower than 20 CFU/g), the mold and yeast count was higher (38% higher than 10(2) CFU/g), demonstrating the importance of these microorganisms in the spoilage of the product; 76% of the samples presented fecal contamination; C. botulinum was not isolated with the methodology employed. No inhibitory effect was observed for A. niger, but all samples han an inhibitory effect over the other species, especially for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Anti-biofilm efficacy of nitric oxide-releasing silica nanoparticles.
AB  - The ability of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing silica nanoparticles to kill biofilm-based microbial cells is reported. Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans were formed in vitro and exposed to NO-releasing silica nanoparticles. Replicative viability experiments revealed that >or= 99% of cells from each type of biofilm were killed via NO release, with the greatest efficacy (>or= 99.999% killing) against gram-negative P. aeruginosa and E. coli biofilms. Cytotoxicity testing demonstrated that the highest dose of NO-releasing silica nanoparticles inhibited fibroblast proliferation to a lesser extent than clinical concentrations of currently administered antiseptics (e.g., chlorhexidine) with proven wound-healing benefits. This study demonstrates the promise of employing nanoparticles for delivering an antimicrobial agent to microbial biofilms.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity evaluation of metronidazole-triazole conjugates.
AB  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of metronidazole-triazole conjugates are reported. Total 21 hybrid compounds have been synthesized with different substitution pattern on the triazole ring in order to study their influence on the antibacterial activity. These compounds demonstrated potent to weak antibacterial activity against Gram-positive, and Gram-negative bacteria. Six compounds have shown equal or better antibacterial activity against Gram-negative strains than the reference compound.
TI  - Activity of novel antibiotic lock solutions in a model against isolates of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are a primary concern in patients with indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs). Instillation of an antibiotic lock solution may serve as an adjunctive therapy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of novel antibiotic-anticoagulant lock solutions using an in vitro model of CVC infection. METHODS: The following lock solutions were evaluated: daptomycin 1 mg/mL (reconstituted with lactated Ringer's [LR]) plus heparin 5000 units/mL, tigecycline 0.5 mg/mL plus ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) 30 mg/mL, gentamicin 5 mg/mL plus EDTA 30 mg/mL, cefazolin 5 mg/mL plus heparin 5000 units/mL, and phosphate-buffered NaCl 0.9% as the control solution. Analysis was performed on Hickman catheter segments inoculated with the following organisms: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The catheters were incubated in the candidate lock solutions for 0, 2, 4, and 24 hours. Student's t-tests were conducted to evaluate reduction in log(10) colony-forming units/milliliter (cfu/mL) of individual lock solutions compared with the control solution. For each organism, analysis of variance and Student's t-tests were performed to determine whether differences existed among the lock solutions. RESULTS: Gentamicin plus EDTA (G+EDTA) and tigecycline plus EDTA (Ti+EDTA) resulted in significant reductions (p < 0.05) of log(10) cfu/mL at 24 hours for all organisms tested. Daptomycin, reconstituted in LR, plus heparin (D+LR+H) demonstrated potent activity against all staphylococcal species (p < 0.05). With respect to MRSA, G+EDTA displayed significantly better activity than Ti+EDTA and cefazolin plus heparin (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference compared with D+LR+H. No antagonism was noted with the addition of anticoagulants to the solutions. CONCLUSIONS: Gentamicin, tigecycline, and daptomycin in combination with anticoagulants as lock solutions displayed potent activity against common pathogens responsible for CRBSIs. Each of these lock solutions deserves strong consideration for study in a clinical trial. Further data on compatibility and stability of these solutions are needed before routine clinical use can be recommended.
TI  - Synthesis of citrate-ciprofloxacin conjugates.
AB  - Two regioisomeric citrate-functionalized ciprofloxacin conjugates have been synthesized and their antimicrobial activities against a panel of clinically-relevant bacteria have been determined. Cellular uptake mechanisms were investigated using wild-type and ompF deletion strains of Escherichia coli K-12.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - Anti-infectious activity of tryptophan metabolites in the L-tryptophan-L-kynurenine pathway.
AB  - To study the anti-infectious effect of a vascular allograft, the antimicrobial activity of tryptophan metabolites mediated by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase was determined. The growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) over 10 h in extracts from post-transplantation vascular allograft was significantly slower than that of extracts from non-transplantation vascular allograft regardless of the presence of tryptophan (p<0.05). When the antimicrobial activity of the tryptophan metabolites in the L-tryptophan-L-kynurenine pathway was examined, 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid had strong antibacterial activity against MRSA, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although antimicrobial activities of anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, and quinolinic acid against them were low. The results showed that, of the tested tryptophan metabolites, 3-hydroxy-DL-kynurenine and alpha-picolinic acid contributed to the anti-infectious effects of the allograft by inhibiting of the growth of microorganisms.
TI  - Microbial burden of some herbal antimalarials marketed at Elele, Rivers State.
AB  - Herbal antimalarials still remain an alternative to our traditional communities who can not afford orthodox antimalarials. This study was aimed at investigating the microbial quality of six herbal antimalarials using standard microbiological methods. Of the six preparations analyzed, "schnapps", palm wine and water were the media of preparation; the water base preparations recorded higher microbial load. The mean microbial load was 159.5 x 10(5) cfu/ml and 217.4 x 10(2)cfu/ml in water and alcohol base preparations respectively. The microbial profile of the preparations showed that the schnapps base preparations were predominantly contaminated with Bacillus sp (Aerobic spore bearers) and Mucor spp. The palm wine preparation harboured Bacillus sp, yeasts and Mucor spp while the water base preparations had several isolates such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli 0157H7, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus feacalis, Serratia marcensces, Staph. aureus, Bacillus spp and Mucor spp. Conclusively, this study underlines the public health importance of these preparations given the high burden of such human pathogen as Ecoli O157H7, Ps aeruginosa, Stahp aureus, etc. in the preparations.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of preservative-free topical anesthetic drops in current use in ophthalmology departments.
AB  - AIM: The antibacterial effect of topical anesthetics may lead to false-negative cultures from corneal specimens of bacterial keratitis. This in vitro study compared the antibacterial effect of 3 unpreserved topical anesthetics to indicate the most appropriate agent for corneal scrapes. METHODS: Four bacterial strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) derived from the most frequently isolated microorganisms from corneal ulcers were cultured from stored control stocks and clinical specimens. These strains were used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3 preservative-free anesthetic eyedrops: proxymetacaine 0.5%, oxybuprocaine 0.4%, and tetracaine 1%. RESULTS: There was no inhibition of growth seen with proxymetacaine 0.5% (5000 microg/mL) with any of the organisms except S. epidermidis, which demonstrated an MIC of 2500 microg/mL (equivalent to a dilution of (1/2)). Tetracaine 1% (10,000 microg/mL) produced an MIC ranging between 625 and 1250 microg/mL, inhibiting all 4 strains at the commercially available dilution. Oxybuprocaine 0.4% (4000 microg/mL) resulted to be the second most inhibitory preparation with an MIC ranging between 1000 and 2000 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Currently used preservative-free topical anesthetics differ in bacterial growth inhibition. This in vitro study showed that proxymetacaine 0.5% is the least inhibitory on bacterial growth and therefore the most appropriate to be used before corneal scrapes.
TI  - Microbiology of gallbladder bile in uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed microflora and their antibiotic sensitivity in normal bile and lithogenic bile with different types of gallstones. METHODS: We performed a case control study of 70 bile samples (35 cholesterol and 35 pigment stones from 51 females and 19 males, aged 21-72 years with a median age of 37 years) from patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated cholelithiasis, and 20 controls (14 females and 6 males, aged 33-70 years with a median age of 38 years) who underwent laparotomy and had no gallbladder stone shown by ultrasound scan. The bile samples were aerobically cultured to assess microflora and their antibiotic susceptibility. The procedures were undertaken under sterile conditions. RESULTS: Thirty-eight (54%) of the 70 patients with gallstones had bacterial isolates. Nine isolates (26%) were from cholesterol stone-containing bile and 29 isolates (82%) from pigment stone-containing bile (P=0.01, t test). Twenty-eight of these 38 (74%) bile samples were shown positive only after enrichment in brain heart infusion medium (BHI) (P=0.02, t test). The overall bacterial isolates from bile samples revealed E. coli predominantly, followed by P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., Klebsiella spp. and S. epidermidis. There were no bacterial isolates in the bile of controls after either direct inoculation or enrichment in BHI. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial isolates were found in pigment stone-containing bile. Non-lithogenic bile revealed no bacteria, showing an association between gallstone formation and the presence of bacteria in bile. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns of isolated organisms were similar irrespective of the type of stone.
TI  - Microbiological and toxicological effects of Perla black bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) extracts: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - We investigated the microbiological and toxicological effects of three Perla black bean extracts on the growth and culture of selected pathogenic microorganisms, the toxicity over Vero cell lines and an in vivo rat model. Three different solvents were used to obtain Perla black bean extracts. All three Perla black bean extracts were tested for antibacterial and antiparasitic activity and further analysed for intrinsic cytotoxicity (IC(50)). Methanol Perla black bean extract was used for acute toxicity test in rats, with the up-and-down doping method. All Perla black bean extracts inhibited bacterial growth. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria monocytogenes showed inhibition, while Escherichia coli and Enterobacter aerogenes did not. Acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were tested in parasites. The best IC(50) was observed for Giardia lamblia, while higher concentrations were active against Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The Vero cells toxicity levels (IC(50)) for methanol, acidified water and acetic acid Perla black bean extract were [mean +/- S.D. (95% CI)]: 275 +/- 6.2 (267.9-282.0), 390 +/- 4.6 (384.8-395.2) and 209 +/- 3.39 (205.6-212.4) microg/ml, respectively. In vivo acute toxicity assays did not show changes in absolute organ weights, gross and histological examinations of selected tissues or functional tests. The acetic acid and methanol Perla black bean extract proved to exhibit strong antibacterial activity and the acidified water Perla black bean extract exerted parasiticidal effects against Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba hystolitica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The three Perla black bean extracts assayed over Vero cells showed very low toxicity and the methanol Perla black bean extract in vivo did not cause toxicity.
TI  - Surface-modified nanoparticles as a new, versatile, and mechanically robust nonadhesive coating: suppression of protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion.
AB  - The synthesis of surface-modified silica nanoparticles, chemically grafted with acrylate and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) groups, and the ability of the resulting crosslinked coatings to inhibit protein adsorption and bacterial adhesion are explored. Water contact angles, nanoindentation, and atomic force microscopy were used to characterize the cross-linked coatings. Coatings showed a high degree of hydrophilicity combined with a remarkable hardness and stiffness in the dry state. Adsorption of the small protein lysozyme from buffer solution on coated silica wafers decreased significantly with increasing grafting density of the PEG groups on the nanoparticles and was completely inhibited at 0.6 chains nm(-2). Coatings significantly reduced adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH 276 in a parallel plate flow chamber with respect to bare glass (>90%), whereas adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 was only marginally affected by the presence of the coating (<15%). Passage of an air-bubble resulted in almost complete detachment (>93%) of both strains from coated glass, indicating that the adhesion strength between both bacterial strains and the coated surface was significantly reduced by the grafted PEG groups. These coatings thus provide a new method to prepare mechanically robust films with nonadhesive properties that will be extremely useful for the design of biocompatible surfaces in biomedical applications.
TI  - [Antagonistic properties of enterococci isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers].
AB  - The strains with antagonistic activity against indicator strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Salmonella enterica were revealed among 58 Enterococcus strains isolated from gastrointestinal tract of long-livers. The influence of different components of MRS medium on the antagonistic effect was established. Antagonistic activity remained on the medium without glucose in 36% of strains, on the medium without tween 80--in 60% of strains, on the medium without sodium acetate and ammonium citric acid--in 65% of strains. The activity both for the lack of K2HPO4, MgSO4 and MnSO4, and in the absence of complex nitrogen sources (peptone, beef extract, yeast extract and hepatic extract) was shown in 76% of strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Comparison of the efficacies of antibiotic-impregnated and silver-impregnated ventricular catheters on the prevention of infections. An in vitro laboratory study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Infection of the cerebrospinal fluid is a life-threatening condition which is usually treated with systemic antibiotics and continued ventricular drainage in children. The aim of this study was to analyze the antimicrobial activities of two antimicrobial-agent-impregnated ventricular catheters and to compare their efficacies on the bacterial cultures. METHODS: Antibiotic-impregnated (clindamycin and rifampicin), silver-impregnated, and standard ventricular catheters were used in this study. The experiment was performed in 2 steps. In the first step, small pieces of the catheters were cut and incubated. Then, they were washed and placed in agar medium. Finally, the number of colonies was counted. In the second step, the pieces of catheters were placed on agar plates containing Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The plates were incubated, and then, the inhibition zone for each catheter was measured. RESULTS: An inhibition zone was observed only in the plates for antibiotic-impregnated catheters. In the other plates, no inhibition zone was detected. The number of colonies was lowest in the plate with the silver-impregnated catheter, followed by the antibiotic-impregnated and standard catheters. CONCLUSION: The antibiotic-impregnated catheter seems more effective for antimicrobial treatment. Although no inhibition zone was found in the plates for silver-impregnated catheters, these catheters allow the lowest bacterial colonization in agar.
TI  - Bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - Previous studies done on wound infections in this environment had been mostly on  the surgical variety rather than the non-surgical. However,few studies available on the non-surgical type have indicated that changes do occur in the pattern and antibiogram of the bacterial isolates of these non-surgical wound infections. This study was therefore designed to investigate the bacteriology of non-surgical wound infections in this environment. A retrospective review of seven hundred and fifty four cases of non-surgical wound infections was conducted between September 2002 and February 2005 at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. A total number of 871 bacterial, and seven fungal isolates were obtained from these wound cultures. In 477 (70.3%) cases, cultures were monomicrobial and 202 (29.8%) polymicrobial. Staphylococcus aureus (38%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), Klebsiella species (17%), Escherichia coli (10.6%), Proteus species (7.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.4%), Streptococcus species (1.6%), Enterococcus faecalis (1.4%), and Candida albicans (0.8%). High rates of antibiotic resistance were recorded among these isolates. 53.4% of them were sensitive to ceftriaxone, 42.5% to gentamycin and 39.3% to ofloxacin. This high antibiotic resistance gives credence to the value of determining the antibiogram of these pathogens in their management. Continuous interaction between the wound care practitioners and microbiology department is also advocated.
TI  - The electricidal effect: reduction of Staphylococcus and pseudomonas biofilms by  prolonged exposure to low-intensity electrical current.
AB  - The activity of electrical current against planktonic bacteria has previously been demonstrated. The short-term exposure of the bacteria in biofilms to electrical current in the absence of antimicrobials has been shown to have no substantial effect; however, longer-term exposure has not been studied. A previously described in vitro model was used to determine the effect of prolonged exposure (i.e., up to 7 days) to low-intensity (i.e., 20-, 200-, and 2,000-microampere) electrical direct currents on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms. Dose- and time-dependent killing was observed. A maximum of a 6-log(10)-CFU/cm(2) reduction was observed when S. epidermidis biofilms were exposed to 2,000 microamperes for at least 2 days. A 4- to 5-log(10)-CFU/cm(2) reduction was observed when S. aureus biofilms were exposed to 2,000 microamperes for at least 2 days. Finally, a 3.5- to 5-log(10)-CFU/cm(2) reduction was observed when P. aeruginosa biofilms were exposed to electrical current for 7 days. A higher electrical current intensity correlated with greater decreases in viable bacteria at all time points studied. In conclusion, low-intensity electrical current substantially reduced the numbers of viable bacteria in staphylococcal or Pseudomonas biofilms, a phenomenon we have labeled the "electricidal effect."
TI  - Treatment of stage III-A-1 and III-B-1 periprosthetic knee infection with two-stage exchange arthroplasty and articulating spacer.
AB  - The incidence of periprosthetic knee infection is generally low, but the economic impact is great. Treatment should take into account the acuteness of the infection, the overall immune/medical status of the patient, and the local factors at the site of the infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two-phase exchange arthroplasty with the use of antibiotic-impregnated articulating spacer, as an alternative treatment of chronic periprosthetic knee infection in patients with minimum systemic and no local compromising factors. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Twenty-four patients were treated with this regiment. All of them returned to normal everyday activity and no infection recurrence was noted over a 2- to 10-year follow-up. Excellent long-term results can be achieved for patients staged as III-A-1 and III-B-1 according to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society staging system, when treated with the aforementioned protocol and intravenous antibiotics.
TI  - Clinicobacteriological study of chronic dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - Chronic dacryocystitis is the inflammation of lacrimal sac, frequently caused by  bacteria. Obstruction of nasolacrimal duct converts the lacrimal sac a reservoir of infection. It is a constant threat to cornea and orbital soft tissue. Moreover, it causes social embarrassment due to chronic watering from the eye. This study was conducted to find out the current clinicobacteriological profile of chronic dacryocystitis in adults. A total of 56 adult patients were selected from ophthalmology OPD. Detail history and clinical examinations were carried out. All patients underwent either dacryocystorhinostomy or dacryocystectomy. A part of the sac was collected for culture and sensitivity. This study revealed that chronic dacryocystitis is more common in females and left eye is more frequently involved than right eye. It is common among lower socioeconomic strata with habit of pond-bathing. Some form of nasal pathology like hypertrophied inferior turbinate, deviated nasal septum, nasal polyp and allergic rhinitis werefound in 19.6% of the patients. Complications of chronic dacryocystitis like conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, acute on chronic dacryocystitis, lacrimal abscess and fistula were seen in 25.0% of these patients; 53.6% of the culture samples were positive for bacterial growth. Gram-positive organisms were most common isolate. Unlike other studies, Staphylococcus aureus (40.0%) was found to be most common Gram-positive organism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.0%) and Steptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%). Among the Gram-negative organisms, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%) was the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.6%) and Haemophilus influenzae (6.6%). Antibiotic sensitivity tests were done. Most of the organisms were resistant to penicillin. Chloramphenicol was effective against most of the Gram-positive organisms. Aminoglycosides, tobramycin in particular, was effective against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fluoroquinolones, namely ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of henna extracts.
AB  - Lawsonia inermis (henna plant) has been used in herbal medicine for ages. However, the medical benefits of this plant have been discussed in only a few publications. In this study, the antibacterial effects of water, alcoholic and oily extracts of Lawsonia inermis leaves against bacterial cultures isolated from various skin diseases were investigated and compared with Tetracycline, Ampicillin, Gentamicin and Ciprofloxacin antibiotics. Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis (Co-agulase negative staphylococci or CONS), ss-hemolytic streptococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa species were obtained from 74 (35 females, 39 males) patients with different skin infections who attended the Dermatology outpatient clinic in Basra General Hospital. The bacterial isolates were treated with L. inermis extracts in vitro. Alcoholic and oily extracts were more effective than the water extract which had no effects using standard method of NCCL, 2000.Alcoholic extracts had the highest antibacterial activity with a MIC of 0.125-0.150 microg/ml against ss-hemolytic streptococci and against CONS was 0.125-175 microg/ml .Oily extracts had a MIC of 0.25-0.30 microg/ml against Staphylococcus epidermidis (cons). Both alcoholic and oily extracts had the same MIC (0.5 microg/ml) on Staphylococcus aureus. However, alcoholic extracts were more effective on Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a MIC of 0.5-0.57 microg/ml than oily extract (MIC of 0.20-0.28 microg/ml). However, there were no statically differences between the effects of oily and alcoholic henna extracts (p= 0.050).When comparing the extracts' MICs with those of antibiotics, alcoholic extracts showed pronounced antibacterial effects against the isolated bacteria in vitro but oily extracts had much similar MICs to those of antibiotics and there are significant difference between effect of both extracts and antibiotics p>0.050.
TI  - Effect of lidocaine gel on povidone-iodine antisepsis and microbial survival.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the use of lidocaine gel prior to povidone-iodine antisepsis is associated with increased microbial survival. SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Madigan Army Medical Center, Fort Lewis, Washington, USA. METHODS: A standardized suspension of Staphylococcus epidermidis was used to inoculate 5 blood agar plates that served as a control. A second group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then lidocaine gel was applied to the plates. A third group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, lidocaine gel was applied, and then povidone-iodine 5% was applied and allowed to cover the plates. A fourth group of 5 blood agar plates was inoculated, and then povidone-iodine 5% was allowed to cover the plates. Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenza were tested in a similar fashion. Microbial growth was evaluated after 24 hours. RESULTS: The number of colony forming units (CFUs) was similar in the control group and the S epidermidis, S aureus, and P aeruginosa lidocaine only and lidocaine with povidone-iodine groups. In these groups, each plate grew between 200 CFUs and 300 CFUs. In the Haemophilus influenza series, the lidocaine with povidone-iodine group had fewer CFUs than the control group. In all 4 series, the povidone-iodine only group had the least amount of CFUs, ranging from 0 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: The use of lidocaine gel before application of povidone-iodine 5% resulted in decreased effectiveness of antisepsis and increased microbial survivability. The increase in microbial survivability may increase the risk for postoperative infection in ocular surgery performed under topical anesthesia.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine impairs susceptibility to biofilm formation of hydrogel contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare silicone-hydrogel, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), and phosphorylcholine-coated (PC-C) contact lenses in terms of their susceptibility to biofilm formation by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DESIGN: Laboratory investigation. METHODS: Biofilm formation on colonized test lenses was evaluated with confocal microscopy and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility assays. The results of the latter assays were compared with those performed on planktonic cultures of the same organism. RESULTS: For both microorganisms, sessile colonies on silicone-hydrogel and pHEMA lenses displayed lower antibiotic susceptibility than their planktonic counterparts. In contrast, the susceptibility of cultures growing on PC-C lenses was comparable with that for planktonic cultures. In particular, minimum inhibitory concentration for Tazocin (piperacillin plus tazobactam; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Aprilia, Italy; S. epidermidis) and gentamicin (P. aeruginosa) was identical, either in the presence of PC-C support or in planktonic cultures (Tazocin, </= 0.2 mug/ml; gentamicin, 0.4 mug/ml). Minimum inhibitory concentration for imipenem (P. aeruginosa) was two-fold higher for PC-C lenses (0.4 mug/ml) with respect to planktonic cultures (0.2 mug/ml). Confocal microscopy of lenses colonized for 24 hours with P. aeruginosa green fluorescent protein-expressing cells revealed a sessile colonization on silicone-hydrogel lens and a few isolated bacterial cells scattered widely over the surface of the PC-C lens. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial cultures was associated with diminished bacterial adhesion. Our results indicate that PC-C lenses seem to be more resistant than silicone-hydrogel and pHEMA lenses to bacterial adhesion and colonization. This feature may facilitate their disinfection.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of Co(II), Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalanine.
AB  - In this paper the first complexes of M(2+) ions (M(2+) = Zn(2+), Cd(2+) and Co(2+)) with N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (1-3) are described. The new complexes were characterized by means of elemental analysis, IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, molar conductivity measurements and (1)H, (13)C and (15)N NMR spectroscopy (1D and 2D). The Co(II) complex adopts an octahedral geometry, and the Zn(II) and Cd(II) complexes adopt a tetrahedral one. For the first time, the antimicrobial activity of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-S-phenylalaninato ligand (N-Boc-S-phe) and the complexes 1-3 was investigated against gram-positive: Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis and gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and two strains of the yeast Candida albicans. It was shown that the complexes were effective against most strains. The best activity was detected against the yeast C. albicans.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Urinary infections due to multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli among persons with HIV disease at a tertiary AIDS care centre in South India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the spectrum of opportunistic infections due to HIV infection has been widely discussed, there are very limited data available in south India on certain incident infections especially urinary tract infections (UTI) in HIV-infected subjects. METHODS: Bacterial aetiology of 350 symptomatic UTI in HIV-infected subjects and the drug resistance pattern of the Escherichia coli isolates tested between June 2005 and July 2007 at the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education, a tertiary HIV Referral Centre in Chennai has been described here. RESULTS: E. coli was the most common etiological agent of UTI in HIV patients, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Twenty-nine E. coli isolates were multi-drug-resistant and 83.3% of the isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary pathogens in HIV-infected patients demonstrate high antimicrobial resistance and with majority of therapy for UTIs being empiric, constant updates of the aetiological agents and their drug susceptibility pattern would largely be beneficial to clinicians in choosing the right drug.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of oxidized cellulose salts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of oxidized cellulose and its salts in linters (-L) and  microsphere (-M) form (OKCEL H-L, OKCEL Zn-M, OKCEL ZnNa-L, OKCEL ZnNa-M and OKCEL Ag-L) were tested by a dilution method against a spectrum of microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. OKCEL Ag-L exhibited antimicrobial activity in the range 0.1-3.5% w/v against all the bacteria and fungi involved in this study. Strong inhibition by OKCEL ZnNa-M was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis in the range 0.5-2.0% w/v. Antimicrobial effects of oxidized cellulose and its salts in textile form were investigated by a diffusion and dilution method against the spectrum of above-cited microbial strains extended by Clostridium perfringens. Generally, OKCEL Ag-T, OKCEL Zn-T and OKCEL H-T showed high antimicrobial activity against populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. OKCEL Zn-T was the only sample suppressing the growth of species.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity of some triazole Mannich bases carrying diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of Mannich bases of 4-substituted 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones, X=H, Cl, Br, 3 and 5 were synthesized and characterized on the basis of IR, NMR and elemental analyses. The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using the Acinetobacter baumanii ATCC 19606; Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027; Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600; Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990; Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 strains. Some of them exhibited promising activities against A. baumanii and B. subtilis.
TI  - Surface antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of incorporated polyethylenimine nanoparticles.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect and biocompatibility of insoluble cross-linked quaternary ammonium polyethylenimine (PEI) nanoparticles incorporated at 1 or 2%w/w in a resin composite were assayed. The antimicrobial effect against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was tested using the direct contact test (DCT), agar diffusion test (ADT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Biocompatibility was tested by assessing macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion. Samples incorporating 2%w/w nanoparticles inhibited the growth of all bacterial strains tested. Reducing the amount of the added nanoparticles to 1%w/w resulted in complete inhibition of S. aureus and E. faecalis, and decreased growth of S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli (p<0.0001). The DCT results were confirmed by SEM. However, ADT showed no inhibition halo in all test bacteria, indicating the antimicrobial nanoparticles are not diffusing into the agar milieu. Biocompatibility tests revealed macrophage viability, and TNFalpha secretion was not altered by the presence of the nanoparticles in the resin. Incorporation of PEI nanoparticles in a resin composite had a long lasing antimicrobial effect against a wide range of bacteria with no measured effect on biocompatibility.
TI  - Surveillance of bacteriological examinations at hospitalization in a pediatric surgical ward.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacteriological examinations at hospitalization were monitored to identify carriers of pathogenic bacteria and prevent the outbreak of nosocomial and postoperative infections. METHODS: In 557 patients, bacteriological examinations were performed within 48 hours after hospitalization. All people were instructed to wash their hands before and after treating carriers of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), and/or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). The disposal of stool and urine of carriers was segregated instead of administration of sensitive antibiotics. RESULTS: The 1176 samples comprised 557 throat swabs, 532 stool samples, and 87 other samples. At hospitalization, 9.2% of the patients were carriers of MRSA; 22.3% of the patients were carriers of MRSA, MRSE, PA, and/or other pathogenic bacteria. This percentage increased to 29.3% in 352 patients with a history of hospitalization, and 35.2% in 244 patients who were hospitalized within 1 year after previous hospitalization. Nosocomial and postoperative infections did not occur during the study period. CONCLUSION: Many patients were detected as carriers of pathogenic bacteria at hospitalization. A history of hospitalization was found to be a risk factor for carrying pathogenic bacteria; hospitalization within 1 year after previous hospitalization was a high-risk factor.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion and growth on a polymer brush-coating.
AB  - Biomaterials-related infections pose serious problems in implant surgery, despite the development of non-adhesive coatings. Non-adhesive coatings, like polymer brush-coatings, have so far only been investigated with respect to preventing initial bacterial adhesion, but never with respect to effects on kinetics of bacterial growth. Here, we compare adhesion and 20 h growth of three bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on pristine and brush-coated silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. Brush-coatings were made using a tri-block copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polypropylene oxide (PPO). Brush-coatings prevented adhesion of staphylococci to below 5 x 10(5)cm(-2) after 30 min, which is a 10-fold reduction compared to pristine silicone rubber. Biofilms grew on both brush-coated and pristine silicone rubber, while the viability of biofilms on brush-coatings was higher than on pristine silicone rubber. However, biofilms on brush-coatings developed more slowly and detached almost fully by high fluid shear. Brush-coating remained non-adhesive after S. epidermidis biofilm formation and subsequent removal whereas a part of its functionality was lost after removal of S. aureus biofilms. Adhesion, growth and detachment of P. aeruginosa were not significantly different on brush-coatings as compared with pristine silicone rubber, although here too the viability of biofilms on brush-coatings was higher. We conclude that polymer brush-coatings strongly reduce initial adhesion of staphylococci and delay their biofilm growth. In addition, biofilms on brush-coatings are more viable and easily removed by the application of fluid shear.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oil and major constituents of Salvia chloroleuca.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia chloroleuca were collected at full flowering stage at  Shahrestanak (Tehran province of Iran). The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-four components were identified, representing 98.5% of the total oil. beta-Pinene (10.6%), alpha-pinene (9.0%), beta-caryophyllene (9.0%), 1,8-cineole (9.0%) and carvacrol (7.9%) were the main components. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of S. chloroleuca was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger); the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that the oil exhibited moderate to high antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Anti-biofilm properties of chitosan-coated surfaces.
AB  - Surfaces coated with the naturally-occurring polysaccharide chitosan (partially deacetylated poly N-acetyl glucosamine) resisted biofilm formation by bacteria and yeast. Reductions in biofilm viable cell numbers ranging from 95% to 99.9997% were demonstrated for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans on chitosan-coated surfaces over a 54-h experiment in comparison to controls. For instance, chitosan-coated surfaces reduced S. epidermidis surface-associated growth more than 5.5 (10)log units (99.9997%) compared to a control surface. As a comparison, coatings containing a combination of the antibiotics minocycline and rifampin reduced S. epidermidis growth by 3.9 (10)log units (99.99%) and coatings containing the antiseptic chlorhexidine did not significantly reduce S. epidermidis surface associated growth as compared to controls. The chitosan effects were confirmed with microscopy. Using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and fluorescent-dye-loaded S. epidermidis, the permeabilization of these cells was observed as they alighted on chitosan-coated surfaces. This suggests chitosan disrupts cell membranes as microbes settle on the surface. Chitosan offers a flexible, biocompatible platform for designing coatings to protect surfaces from infection.
TI  - Effectiveness of a 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate locking solution in preventing biofilm formation by organisms causing haemodialysis catheter-related infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic locks may be used to prevent haemodialysis catheter-related infections (CRIs). This in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution in preventing biofilm formation by the most common pathogens causing haemodialysis CRIs. METHODS: Ten clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were tested. Bacterial suspensions of each isolate were prepared in a control solution of normal saline/Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB) and in a lock solution of 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate and MHB. The bacterial suspensions were placed into the wells of a Calgary Biofilm Device (CBD) and incubated with fresh solution every 24 h for 72 h. The biofilm formation was assessed by removing the CBD pegs, placing them in normal saline and sonicating them for 5 min. The resulting solution was sampled and the colony counts were determined after 24 h of incubation. RESULTS: All controls demonstrated biofilm growth of between 6 x 10(6) and 7.4 x 10(7) cfu/mL over 72 h. In the 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution, no biofilm growth was observed after 72 h of incubation. These results were consistent among duplicates of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate lock solution prevented the biofilm formation of all isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in vitro. Further studies are necessary to determine its efficacy and safety in the haemodialysis population.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial effects of topical local anesthetics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antibacterial activities of local anesthetics are recognized. OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro the activity of topical local anesthetic ointments at clinical doses. METHODS: The activity of two different local anesthetic ointments including lidocaine 5% and lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis by the disc-diffusion method. Sterile discs containing topical local anesthetic drugs were prepared taking into account the doses of ointments used in clinical practice. The validity of the methodology was confirmed using topical antibacterial mupirocin. The inhibition zones of the discs were measured. RESULTS: Mupirocin inhibited all the bacteria. Both local anesthetic ointments were found to be most effective on E. coli, whereas they had no effects on P. aeruginosa. Lidocaine 5% revealed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, S. pyogenes and E. faecalis, but lidocaine/prilocaine 2.5% showed no activity on E. faecalis and inhibited S. pyogenes only at double doses. It was also observed that the antibacterial activity was in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: In the light of these findings, it might be concluded that topical local anesthetic ointments in routine settings may have a preventive role against some bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-MRSA cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase III clinical development. Ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against Gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant S. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram-negative bacilli including AmpC-producing Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. In single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for AmpC beta-lactamases.Ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30 minutes. Peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/mL for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/mL for a 750-mg dose. The volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 L/kg ( approximately 18 L), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. Ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. Ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of approximately 0.5 hours for MRSA and a longer PAE of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f T(>MIC) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole MIC < or =4 and < or =2 mg/L, respectively.Currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. In a phase III trial, 784 patients with Gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for MRSA infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared with 90% for vancomycin. A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. Of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. No difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. Microbiologic eradication of Gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) [ceftobiprole 91% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and MRSA (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as Gram-negative bacilli, E. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and P. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. Similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive MSSA and PVL-positive MRSA.Currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to MRSA and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven MRSA; phase III trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. Ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. The broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - In vitro investigation of the antibacterial effect of ketamine.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of local anesthetics especially lidocaine has  been shown previously. In this study, the antibacterial effect of ketamine, a general anesthetic agent was investigated. METHODS: The antibacterial effect of ketamine was studied using six different strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Entecoccus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) with disc diffusion method. Ciprofloxacine discs (CIP, oxoid) were used as a control to verify the methodology. Minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ketamine for these bacteria were also determined. RESULTS: No inhibition was evident in discs containing 62.5 microg of ketamine. Ketamine 125 microg showed activity on all the bacteria tested with the exception of E. coli. The inhibition rates of Ketamine were more prominent at the doses of 250 microg and 500 microg similar to the inhibition rate of CIP. Whereas MIC and MBC values of ketamine for S. aureus and S. pyogenes were 500 microg mL(-1), MIC and MBC values for P. aeruginosa were above 2000 microg mL(-1). For other bacteria, these values ranged between these levels. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine with higher doses showed antibacterial activity. We thought that it will be proper to use ketamine hesitantly in experimental animal studies like sepsis and translocation.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 3931 organisms isolated from intensive care units in Canada: Canadian National Intensive Care Unit Study, 2005/2006.
AB  - We tested the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci  and 12 antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacilli versus 3931 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained between September 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, from 19 intensive care units (ICUs) across Canada. The most active (based upon MIC only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.06 and < or =0.03, 0.25 and 0.12, 2 and 1, 0.5 and 0.5, and 1 and 2, respectively. The most active agents against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 1, 4, and 0.12, respectively. The most active agents against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4, < or =1, < or =0.12, 8, and 0.5, respectively. The most active agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were meropenem and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of < or =0.12 and 1, respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 16, 32, 16, and 64, respectively. The most active agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4 and 4, respectively. The most active agents against Acinetobacter baumannii were fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. In conclusion, the most active agents versus Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli obtained from Canadian ICUs were daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, dalbavancin and amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline (not P. aeruginosa), respectively.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some new 2,3-dimethoxy-3-hydroxy-2-(1-phenyl-3-aryl-4-pyrazolyl)chromanones.
AB  - Seven new 2,3-dimethoxy-3-hydroxy-2-(1-phenyl-3-aryl-4-pyrazolyl)chromanones (5)  have been synthesized by the oxidation of 3-hydroxy-2-(1-phenyl-3-aryl-4-pyrazolyl)chromones (4) with iodobenzene diacetate in methanol. The structures of compounds 5 were established by the combined use of (1)H NMR, IR and mass spectra. All the seven compounds (5) were tested in vitro for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus pumilus and two gram-negative bacteria namely, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three compounds, 5d, 5f and 5g, have displayed antibacterial activity comparable to the commercial antibiotics, Linezolid, Cefaclor and Cefuroxime axetial.
TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Antimicrobial Activity of d Metal Complexes of some 2-Substituted-1H-Benzimidazoles.
AB  - The metal complexes of nine 2-substituted-1H-benzimidazoles (I-IX) with Ni(II), Pd(II), Cu(II), Ag(I), Zn(II) salts were synthesized. The compounds were characterized by melting point, analytical data, IR spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility.

Cu(II)and Ag(I)complexes of II, III and IV showed considerable activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, S. typhi, Sh. flexneri and C. albicans microorganisms, the ligands themselves having no effect.
TI  - An experimental study on antimicrobial activity of silicone oil in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial activity of silicone oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in vitro. METHODS: S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans were prepared to 1 McFarland turbidity, 10(5) and 10(3) CFU/ml. The bacteria and fungi were inoculated into silicone oil (Acri.Sil-ol 5000), physiologic saline, meat extract broth for bacteria and Sabouraud broth for fungi, respectively. From each sample, 10 microl were taken and plated in petri dishes with the addition of blood agar media for bacteria and Sabouraud dextrose agar for fungi. After overnight incubation, CFUs were enumerated. Cultured from the initially prepared specimens, overnight incubation and CFU counting were repeated until no growth of microorganisms was seen in the silicone oil-containing media. RESULTS: (1) In the group 1 McFarland, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans survived for 13, 6, 20, and 16 days in silicone oil, respectively, which was shorter than in the other media. (2) In the group 10(5) CFU/ml, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans survived for 2, 6, 20, and 1 days in silicone oil, respectively, which was shorter than in the other media. (3) In the group 10(3) CFU/ml, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans survived for 1, 1, 20, and 1 days in silicone oil, respectively, which was shorter than in the other media. CONCLUSION: Silicone oil has a significant antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans in vitro.
TI  - [Investigation of 728 strains of infectious bacteria in burn ward and analysis of their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious strains of bacteria in our burn ward in recent 5 years, and analyze their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the wound excretions of 306 burn patients hospitalized during 2001 to 2006 for analyzing their strains and their antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: 378 strains were Grams positive bacteria, among them Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant strain. Further analysis showed that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranked the first in occurrence, followed by methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus fecalis, 338 strains were Gram negative bacteria, and among them Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant, and Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the 2nd and 3rd. Twelve strains were fungi. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics in our burn ward may be related to the beta-lactamases from acinetobacter baumannii and multiple-drug-resistance of MRSA.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of meropenem against main bacterial species isolated from patient blood in 2006].
AB  - Using broth micro-dilution method, we studied the susceptibility of 180 clinical  isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis to meropenem (MEPM) and reference agents. All strains were isolated from the blood of patients admitted to Keio University Hospital between January 2006 and November 2006. The results were as follows: 1. MEPM showed greater potency against Gram-negative bacteria than the other carbapenems including doripenem in particular. A metallo-beta-lactamase producing multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa strain was detected. 2. A comparison of the antibacterial activity of MEPM with that in our previous studies 1997-1998, 1999, 2002-2003, and 2004 showed no marked increase in MEPM-resistant clinical isolates. These results suggest that MEPM retains its potency as the agent of choice in treating serious infections.
TI  - Medical-grade honey kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria in vitro and eradicates skin colonization.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance among microbes urgently necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Since ancient times, honey has been used successfully for treatment of infected wounds, because of its antibacterial activity. However, large variations in the in vitro antibacterial activity of various honeys have been reported and hamper its acceptance in modern medicine. METHODS: We assessed the in vitro bactericidal activity of Revamil (Bfactory), a medical-grade honey produced under controlled conditions, and assessed its efficacy for reduction of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers in a within-subject-controlled trial. RESULTS: With Bacillus subtilis as a test strain, we demonstrated that the variation in bactericidal activity of 11 batches of medical-grade honey was <2-fold. Antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were killed within 24 h by 10%-40% (vol/vol) honey. After 2 days of application of honey, the extent of forearm skin colonization in healthy volunteers was reduced 100-fold (P < .001), and the numbers of positive skin cultures were reduced by 76% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Revamil is a promising topical antimicrobial agent for prevention or treatment of infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Positive corneoscleral rim culture in penetrating keratoplasty at the Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of positive corneoscleral rim cultures preserved in Optisol GS medium, to identify pathogens involved and possible recipient eye infection. METHODS: A hundred sixty-three corneoscleral rim cultures penetrating keratoplasties performed from January 2001 to January 2003 in the Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre were reviewed. Enucleations and corneal storage were done as aseptic as possible and gentamicin 0.3% was instilled. Corneoscleral rim was divided into two segments, half was inoculated into Sabouraud broth and the other half into thioglycolate broth; inoculation into blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar was done later if necessary for pathogen identification. The receiver's eye data were reviewed. RESULTS: There were eleven positive cultures (6.7%) out of 163 evaluated corneoscleral rim cultures. Of these, four were Staphylococcus epidermidis, one was Staphylococcus aureus, one was Serratia sp., one was Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the other four were different subtypes of Candida (two Candida sp., one Candida albicans and one Candida parapapilosis). All pathogens were resistant to gentamicin. None of the eleven cases of positive corneoscleral rim cultures resulted in ocular infection at the receiver's eyes (six months follow-up). CONCLUSIONS: We found low rates of positive corneoscleral rim cultures after penetrating keratoplasty at the Porto Alegre Clinical Hospital. The most frequent involved pathogens were Staphylococcus sp and Candida sp. Although we did not identify any postoperative infection at the receiver's eyes, we recommend corneoscleral rim culture for guidance of postoperative infection, a rare but possible devastating ocular event.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of riboflavin/UVA combination (365 nm) in vitro for bacterial and fungal isolates: a potential new treatment for infectious keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To demonstrate the antimicrobial properties of riboflavin/UVA (365 nm) against common pathogens. METHODS: One group of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PA], Staphylococcus aureus [SA], and Staphylococcus epidermidis [SE]) was tested by using Kirby-Bauer discs with (1) empty disc (Control - C); (2) riboflavin 0.1% (B2); (3) riboflavin 0.1% previously activated by UVA (B2'); (4) UVA alone (UVA); (5) group 2+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2); and (6) group 3+additional UVA exposure (UVA+B2'). In addition, another group of microbes was tested with the same approach: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRPA), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), and Candida albicans (CA). The mean growth inhibition zone (GIZ) in square millimeters was measured around the discs. The mean standard deviation (MSD) was calculated to be 3.65 when alpha = 0.01. A mean deviation (MD) > MSD indicates a significant difference. RESULTS: In the first group, the GIZ was significantly greater after UVA (MD = 14.30), UVA+B2 (MD = 39.61), and UVA+B2' (MD = 40.45) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective than UVA+B2 (MD = 25.31) and UVA+B2' (MD = 26.15). The second group demonstrated increased GIZ in UVA (MD = 6.98), UVA+B2 (MD = 17.80), and UVA+B2' (MD = 21.15) when compared with C, B2, and B2'. UVA alone was less effective against the second group of bacteria than was UVA+B2 (MD = 10.82) and UVA+B2' (MD = 14.17). CA did not show any GIZ after treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Riboflavin/UVA was effective against SA, SE, PA, MRSA, MDRPA, and DRSP, but was ineffective on CA and has the potential for use in treatment of microbial keratitis in the future.
TI  - Quorum sensing inhibitory drugs as next generation antimicrobials: worth the effort?
AB  - Bacterial resistance poses a major challenge to the development of new antimicrobial agents. Conventional antibiotics have an inherent obsolescence because they select for development of resistance. Bacterial infections have again become a serious threat in developed countries. Particularly, elderly, immunocompromised, and hospitalized patients are susceptible to infections caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These bacteria form chronic, biofilm-based infections, which are challenging because bacterial cells living as biofilms are more tolerant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. Therefore, research should identify new antimicrobial agents and their corresponding targets to decrease the biofilm-forming capability or persistence of the infectious bacteria. Here, we review one such drug target: bacterial cell-to-cell communication systems, or quorum sensing.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - [Etiological analysis on bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of organisms causing bacterial endophthalmitis and their sensitivities to commonly used ocular antibiotics. METHODS: A retrospective analysis on microbiological records of 728 intraocular specimens of patients with suspected endophthalmitis from January 1999 to December 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility of these isolates was determined for commonly used ocular antibiotics using the Kirby-Bauer disk-diffusion test. RESULTS: In all, 168 organisms were isolated from 728 intraocular specimens during the study interval. Overall, 96 (57.1%) of 168 isolates were Gram-positive cocci, 52 (31.0%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 18 (10.7%) were Gram-positive bacilli, and 2 (1.2%) were Gram-negative cocci. The most common organisms identified were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 21.4% (36/168), Staphylococcus aureus in 11.3% (19/168), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 8.9% (15/168). For Gram-positive cocci, sensitivities were the following: vancomycin 93.4% (85/91), levofloxacin 84.4% (81/96), ofloxacin 68.8% (66/96), ciprofloxacin 59.4% (57/96), gentamicin 56.3% (54/96), and tobramycin 43.8% (42/96). For Gram-negative bacilli, sensitivities were the following: levofloxacin 88.2% (45/51), ofloxacin 76.9% (40/52), ciprofloxacin 75.0% (39/52), gentamicin 49.0% (25/51), and tobramycin 48.1% (25/52). Comparing the data from 2003 to 2006 with the data from 1999 to 2002, the susceptibility of organisms to frequently employed antibiotics was decreasing. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of organisms causing bacterial endophthalmitis is complex, and no single antibiotic provided coverage for all of the microbes isolated from intraocular specimens with bacterial endophthalmitis. Combination therapy is recommended as the initial empiric treatment of suspected bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - Efficacy of combination of chlorhexidine and protamine sulphate against device-associated pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine: (i) the potential in vitro synergy of combining protamine sulphate (PS) with chlorhexidine (CHX); (ii) the in vitro spectrum and durability of antimicrobial activity of CHX + PS-coated catheters; and (iii) the in vivo efficacy of CHX + PS-coated catheters in comparison with silver-hydrogel-coated and uncoated catheters. METHODS: The potential synergistic antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of CHX and PS were investigated in vitro by the MIC and biofilm assays. The spectrum and durability of antimicrobial activity of CHX + PS-coated catheters were studied in vitro by using a serial plate transfer method. The in vivo efficacy of CHX + PS-coated catheters was assessed in a rabbit model against Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the combination of CHX + PS has a synergistic inhibitory effect on E. coli and provides a significant synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Furthermore, catheters coated with CHX + PS provided a broad-spectrum and enduring in vitro antimicrobial activity over a 10 day period. The in vivo efficacy study demonstrated that subcutaneously implanted CHX + PS-coated catheters in rabbits are significantly less likely to become colonized (2/28 = 7%) than either silver-hydrogel-coated (25/28 = 89%; P < 0.001) or uncoated catheters (18/28 = 64%; P < 0.001) by E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic, broad-spectrum and durable in vitro activity of the CHX + PS combination and the robust in vivo efficacy of catheters coated with this unique composition encourage clinical evaluation of this innovative approach.
TI  - Microbiological profile of donor corneas: a retrospective study from an eye bank  in north India.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbiological profile and the antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms cultured from donor corneas and evaluate with respect to the decontamination protocols during the study period. METHODS: Retrospective review of microbiological culture reports of 2,291 donor eyes sent from January 2000 to December 2003. Donor corneas were treated with 0.4% gentamicin (phase I), 1% povidone-iodine and 0.4% gentamicin (phase II), and 5% povidone-iodine with 0.4% amikacin (phase III). Limbal swabs taken by the eye bank technician after antimicrobial decontamination of donor eyes and sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture were tracked. The positive culture reports with antibiotic sensitivity pattern were studied and results correlated with decontamination protocols. RESULTS: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Alkaligenes faecalis were the 3 most common isolates overall. The percentage of positive bacterial cultures reduced when we used 5% povidone-iodine and 0.4% amikacin (31.3%) as compared to 1% povidone-iodine and 0.4% gentamicin (61.8%) (P < 0.001). Addition of povidone-iodine decreased positive fungal cultures from 6% in phase I to 2.2% in phase II (P < 0.01) and 1.9% in phase III (P < 0.01). Amongst the total bacterial cultures sent after antimicrobial treatment, Gram-positive bacteria decreased from 38.6% (64/166) in phase I to 27.6% (402/1457) and 10.8% (72/668) in phases II and III, respectively (P < 0.001), and Gram-negative bacteria increased from 10.2% (17/166) to 18.8% (274/1457) and 19.8% (132/668), respectively (P = 0.02). Amongst the positive bacterial cultures, the proportion of Gram-positive bacteria decreased from 79.0% (64/81) in phase I to 59.5% (402/676) and 35.3% (72/204) in phases II and III, respectively (P < 0.001), and that of Gram-negative bacteria increased from 21.0% (17/81) to 40.5% (274/676) and 64.7% (132/204), respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Different combinations of antimicrobials failed to eliminate all organisms, especially Gram-negative bacteria from the donor corneal surface. The increase in proportion of Gram-negative bacteria despite the use of amikacin combined with povidone-iodine suggests a need to find a better combination for decontamination of donor corneal tissue.
TI  - Diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
AB  - Bone infection in the diabetic foot is always a complication of a preexisting infected foot wound. Prevalence can be as high as 66%. Diagnosis can be suspected in two mains conditions: no healing (or no depth decrease) in spite of appropriate care and off-loading, and/or a visible or palpated bone with a metal probe. The first recommended diagnostic step is to perform (and if necessary to repeat) plain radiographs. After a four-week treatment period, if plain radiographs are still normal, suspicion for bone infection will persist in case of bad evolution despite optimized management of off-loading and arterial disease. It is only in such cases that other diagnosis methods than plain radiographs must be used. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogen cultured from bone samples, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Among enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus sp. are the most common, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Surprisingly, bacteria usually considered contaminant (as coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) and Corynebacterium sp.) have been documented to be pathogens in the osteomyelitis of diabetic foot. Traditional approach to treatment of chronic osteomyelitis was by surgical resection of infected and necrotic bone. But new classes of antibiotics have both the required spectrum of activity and the capacity to penetrate and concentrate in the infected bone. Recently, several observations of osteomyelitis remission following non-surgical management with a prolonged course of antibiotics have been published. Lastly, combined approach with local bone excision and antibiotics has been proposed. Prospective trials should be undertaken to determine the relative roles of surgery and antibiotics in managing diabetic foot osteomyelitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - A five-year study in Iran of ophthalmia neonatorum: prevalence and etiology.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to determine the prevalence of conjunctivitis and its bacteriological causes in neonates hospitalized in two hospitals in Iran and to evaluate the maternal and newborns' data in conjunctivitis cases. MATERIAL/METHODS: All newborns presenting at Imam Khomeini and Vali-e-Asr hospitals (2001-2006) with clinical suspicion of conjunctivitis and positive microbiology were studied. The medical files of those with conjunctivitis were assessed. RESULTS: Of 4021 neonates examined for the presence of conjunctivitis, 198 (4.9%) had conjunctivitis. Sixty-five percent of the cases had been delivered by cesarean section, 47% and 11% had histories of maternal premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and genitourinary infection, respectively, 65% were preterm, and 61% and 32% had low weight and APGAR score below 7 at birth, respectively. In addition, 22% had septicemia. The most common organism causing ophthalmia was S. aureus (31%), followed by E. coli (23%), S. epidermis (22%), Klebsiella (10%), N. gonorrhea (3%), C. trachomatis (2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%). In the neonates with septicemia the most common cause of conjunctivitis was E. coli (38%). Neonates with E. coli conjunctivitis had a significantly (P<0.05) higher rate of a history of maternal genitourinary infection and a higher rate of septicemia than non-E. coli cases. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 4.9% found here is consistent with other reports ranging from 1.6 to 12% of neonates. Data such as birth weight, APGAR score, presence of septicemia, maternal genitourinary infections, and PROM may play a role in the development of neonatal conjunctivitis by different pathogens.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of intravitreal levofloxacin in an experimental model of endophthalmitis.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal 1.5% levofloxacin versus combined treatment with vancomycin and ceftazidime in an experimental model of bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: The right eye of 75 New Zealand White rabbits was inoculated in the vitreous cavity with strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study evaluated treatment with 1.5% levofloxacin compared with 1% vancomycin plus 2.2% ceftazidime, and a control group. At 24 h after treatment, 100 microl vitreous and aqueous humor were harvested, and the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per ml was determined. The microbiological status of the vitreous and aqueous humor samples was tested at day 2, 3, 5 and 8. The Peyman classification was used to assess the severity of endophthalmitis. RESULTS: For the S. epidermidis endophthalmitis model, levofloxacin treatment produced an approximately 3 log decrease in CFU/ml of vitreous relative to that in untreated eyes (p = 0.023), whereas vancomycin plus ceftazidime produced a 5 log reduction in CFU/ml (p = 0.023). However, in the S. aureus model, levofloxacin treatment produced an approximately 4 log reduction in CFU/ml, whereas vancomycin plus ceftazidime produced an approximately 2 log reduction in CFU/ml relative to that of the control (p = 0.018 and p = 0.019, respectively). Treatment of P. aeruginosa-infected rabbit eyes with levofloxacin produced a 5 log reduction in CFU/ml of vitreous, whereas vancomycin plus ceftazidime produced an approximately 3-4 log reduction in CFU/ml relative to that of the control (p = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference between levofloxacin and vancomycin plus ceftazidime on comparing the reduction of CFU/ml of vitreous for any of the bacterial strains studied. CONCLUSIONS: Levofloxacin appears to be effective in treating experimental endophthalmitis in the rabbit model. Further studies, especially on the toxicity of intravitreal levofloxacin, are required before a clinical role for the drug in postoperative therapy can be determined.
TI  - Effect of Octenisept antiseptic on bioburden of neoplastic ulcers in patients with advanced cancer.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of octenidine dihydrochloride (Octenisept, Schulke & Mayr) on the clinical condition and bacterial flora in neoplastic ulcers. METHOD: Twenty-one patients with advanced cancer and neoplastic ulcers were included in the study. Octenisept-moistened gauze dressings were applied to the ulcers three times daily. The clinical and bacteriological status of the wounds were assessed at baseline and after three weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Thirty-three bacterial strains were cultured at baseline. After three weeks of treatment, the tests were repeated on 16 patients. Clinical observations confirmed an improvement in the clinical condition of the ulcers, characterised by a reduction in necrosis, exudate levels, erythema and oedema. According to the bacteriological assessment, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated from the wounds. Enterococcus faecalis persisted in two patients, Escherichia coli in one patient and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in another patient. CONCLUSION: Octenispet was an effective antimicrobial: Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were eradicated in all ulcers. After three weeks of treatment, none of the ulcers developed an infection and there was an improvement in their clinical condition.
TI  - [In vitro activity of ertapenem against strains isolated from diabetic foot infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of ertapenem against bacterial strains isolated from diabetic foot infections (DFI). METHODOLOGY: All diabetic patients hospitalized for a first episode of DFI (stages 2 to 4, according to the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot Classification) were selected in the Nimes University hospital between January 2005 to December 2005. MICs were determined using both E-test strips and dilution methods on bacterial strains isolated from foot samples. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-two bacteria (154 Gram-positive cocci including 94 Staphylococcus aureus, 80 Gram-negative bacilli with 56 Enterobacteriaceae, and 18 anaerobes) were studied. Ertapenem was active against all Streptococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, anaerobes, and also against 89.8% of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates. However, this antibiotic was active only against 31.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 21.8% of Enterococcus faecalis, and 15.8% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that ertapenem may be a useful agent to treat patients suffering from DFI after bacterial identification.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of bioactive bone cements.
AB  - Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) based bone cement is widely used to anchor artificial joints. In recent years, antibiotics have been incorporated in bone cements and administered systemically to either prevent or reduce the severity of infections. Certain antibiotics, such as tobramycin or vancomycin antibiotics have been incorporated at high concentrations into PMMA bone cements when dealing with infected hip joints, however, the inclusion of some antibiotics adversely affect the mechanical properties of the cement. Furthermore, studies have indicated that the incorporation of gentamicin in PMMA cements does not have a statistically significant effect on the biofilm formation of species such as Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Bioactive glasses have been shown to have numerous applications in the biomedical field because of their properties in bonding to both hard and soft tissues. Bioglass(R) undergoes surface dissolution in a physiological environment forming a hydroxycarbonate apatite layer and, in addition, exhibits the anti-inflammatory properties. Recent studies have shown that two paste bioactive bone cement systems that use Bioglass(R) as filler exhibit physical and mechanical properties comparable to PMMA cements with low polymerization exotherm and better mechanical properties with improved adhesion to bone and implant surfaces. In this study, Bioglass(R) containing two paste bone cements were investigated for their potential bacteriostatic properties and compared with PMMA cements with and without antibiotics. The results of this study indicated that the PMMA cement containing the antibiotic, gentamycin and the Bioglass(R) containing cements both pre- and post-immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for brief periods showed the inhibition zones were not statistically significantly different in their average size for any of the three bacterial species, namely Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, the PMMA cement without any antibiotic, namely gentamycin (CMW1) did not show any inhibition zones around the specimens for any of the three bacterial species. It was also noted that both Bioglass(R) filled bioactive cements immersed in SBF showed statistically significant increases in inhibition zones for all three specimens compared to specimens that were not immersed (p<0.001).
TI  - Evaluation of phytochemical and antibacterial potential of Helicteres isora L. fruits against enteric bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of aqueous, acetone, ethanol and methanol extracts of fruits of Helicteres isora (Mororphali) were studied. The fruit aqueous extracts of H. isora showed prominent antibacterial activities against E. coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhimurium and Proteus vulgaris; moderate activity against Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and least activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The aqueous extract showed maximal, the ethanol and methanol extract moderate and acetone extracts least antibacterial activities. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of carbohydrates, anthraquinon glycosides, proteins, tannin and phenolic compounds and steroids These antibacterial properties supports its traditional use of fruits of H. isora in the treatment of enteric or diarrhoeal infections.
TI  - Effect of ethanol/trisodium citrate lock on microorganisms causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: This in vitro study tested the effectiveness of a novel 30% ethanol/4% trisodium citrate (TSC) lock solution against the most common pathogens causing hemodialysis catheter-related infections. METHODS: Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 4), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (n = 8), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and Escherichia coli (n = 4) were tested in duplicate. Bacterial suspensions of each isolate were made in a control solution of normal saline and Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), and in a lock solution of ethanol 30%, TSC 4% and MHB. Suspensions were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. Colony counts were determined from samples collected at t = 0 h (before exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 1 h (one hour after exposure to the ethanol/TSC lock), t = 24 h and t = 48 h. To confirm the absence of viable organisms in the lock solution, the remaining volume at 48 h was filtered through a 0.45 microm filter. The filter was rinsed with 15 mL sterile water and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA). RESULTS: All controls demonstrated significant growth over 48 h. In the lock solutions, initial inocula were reduced to 0 viable colonies by t = 1 h (6-log kill), and there was no growth at t = 24 and 48 h. Filtering of lock solutions also showed no growth. These results were consistent among duplicates of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The 30% ethanol/4% TSC lock solution consistently eradicated MRSA, MSSA, MRSE, P. aeruginosa and E. coli within 1 h of exposure. Experiments are currently underway to test this novel lock solution on preventing biofilm production by these pathogens.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - Determination of the shear force at the balance between bacterial attachment and  detachment in weak-adherence systems, using a flow displacement chamber.
AB  - We introduce a procedure for determining shear forces at the balance between attachment and detachment of bacteria under flow. This procedure can be applied to derive adhesion forces in weak-adherence systems, such as polymer brush coatings, which are currently at the center of attention for their control of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - Chronic peritoneal dialysis a single-center experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In Saudi Arabia, experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) as a renal replacement therapy is limited, and publications are scanty. The present study was undertaken to evaluate CAPD in the Saudi population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients managed by CAPD from May 1993 to September 2002 were included in the study. Tenckhoff indwelling silicone-rubber double-cuff catheters were surgically implanted. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) was started 2 weeks after catheter insertion. Generally, 2-L exchanges 4 times daily were used. Our total of 91 PD patients included 50 men in the age range 13 - 80 years (mean: 48 +/- 18 years), and 41 women in the age range 16 - 76 years (mean: 52 +/- 18 years). Forty-nine patients performed dialysis by themselves; 42 patients needed a helper. RESULTS: Between April 2001 and September 2002, we noted, on average, 1 episode of peritonitis per 21 patient-months and 1 episode of exit-site infection per 24 patient-months. The most common causative organisms for peritonitis were Pseudomonas (16%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7%). No organisms were grown in 13% of peritonitis episodes. The organisms most commonly responsible for exit-site infection were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50%) and Staphylococcus (31%). We removed catheters from 32 patients, 12 of those for mechanical reasons. Of the 20 patients whose catheter was removed for infection, P. aeruginosa was cultured in 11 cases. Nine of 23 patients switched to hemodialysis were switched for refractory peritonitis. By the end of the study, 38 patients were still on CAPD, 23 had been switched to hemodialysis, 10 had undergone renal transplantation, and 20 had died. The major causes of death were peritonitis with sepsis (n = 6), cardiovascular causes (n = 5), and sudden death at home or in other hospitals (n = 5). CONCLUSION: Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is a viable option of renal replacement therapy in Saudi Arabia. The main problem encountered was peritonitis.
TI  - [Pertussis toxin and cross-reactive antigens in dynamics of Bordetella pertussis  cultivation].
AB  - Cultures of Bordetella pertussis from phases of exponential growth, retarded growth and from stationary phase were obtained during periodic dynamic cultivation. Preparations for intravenous immunization of rabbits were made from these cultures. Levels of IgG to pertussis toxin, cell walls preparations from 12 bacterial species, 4 organo-specific antigens, and 7 organospecific human antigens were measured in obtained sera. It was shown that higher levels of IgG to pertussis toxin were found in sera of rabbits immunized with cultures from exponential growth phase whereas decrease of this level in 8 times was observed in sera of rabbits immunized with cultures from retarded growth phase or end of stationary phase. After immunization with culture from exponential growth phase increase of IgG levels to cross-reactive antigens was not observed compared to levels of these antibodies in control sera obtained before immunization. After immunization with cultures from retarded growth phase or end of stationary phase increase of IgG levels to preparations of cell walls of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, to denaturated DNA, elastin, and renal and liver microsomal fractions was detected compared to control sera. Described data can substantiate usefulness of obtaining the most specific diagnostic sera and test-systems using cultures of B. pertussis from the phase of exponential growth.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Development of a sanitizing fabric wipe for use on food contact surfaces.
AB  - A sanitizer was incorporated into disposable sanitary wipes that were used to eliminate microorganisms on plastic and metal surfaces. These surfaces were inoculated with strains of Bacillus subtilis OSU 494, Enterococcus faecalis OSU 48, Escherichia coli ATCC 29181, Listeria innocua ATCC 33090, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OSU 167, Salmonella enteritidis OSU 799, Staphylococcus epidermidis OSU 838), Candida albicans ATCC 10231, and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 10894. These inoculated surfaces were cleaned with the wipes for 5, 10, and 30 s, then organisms surviving on the cleaned surfaces and in the wipes were enumerated. Applying the sanitizing wipe to the plastic and metal surfaces reduced the viability of bacteria (> log 4 for 5 s), yeast cells (> log 5 for 10 s), and fungal spores (< log 4 for all times). The use of large pore sized or thick wipes showed better sanitizing result when compared with the use of the small pore sized and slim wipe. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between surviving numbers on the surface of the plastic compared with that of the metal.
TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis in children: diagnostic and therapeutic aspects.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. Its incidence owing to invasive Streptococcus pyogenes has significantly increased in children recently. Our experience with NF in children to describe diagnostic and therapeutic aspects is hence presented herein. METHODS: Records of children who were treated for NF in our unit from 1999 to 2006, inclusive, were reviewed retrospectively. Information recorded for each patient included medical history, clinical characteristics, diagnostic procedures, treatment methods, and the outcome. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with a mean age of 35 months were treated for NF during the study period. All of the 13 children had no previous immunosuppression. The predisposing factors were composed of varicella lesions, intramuscular injections, application of a cream containing menthol to the cervical region, penetrant gluteal trauma, omphalitis, dental abscess, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The most common site of the initial involvement was the abdominal wall, followed by the gluteal region and thigh, head and neck, and upper and lower extremities. The initial skin presentations were induration or cellulitis and erythema and edema with progression to skin discoloration and bullae formation. Fever and tachycardia were the most common clinical features. S. pyogenes was the most common causative microorganism, followed by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All patients underwent extensive surgical debridement and received appropriate antibiotics and supportive therapy. Twelve patients survived, and 1 patient with delayed diagnosis of NF died of septic shock. CONCLUSION: Although these infections are rare in children, their lethal potential and early diagnostic signs must be recognized. All children with NF should undergo early surgical debridement to prevent delay in treatment. The mortality and morbidity associated with NF in children can be decreased with clinical awareness, early diagnosis, and adequate and urgent surgical debridement followed by intensive supportive care and early wound resurfacing.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to conventional hydrogel and new silicone-hydrogel contact lens materials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: As bacterial adhesion to contact lenses may contribute to the pathogenesis of keratitis, the aim of our study was to investigate in vitro adhesion of clinically relevant bacteria to conventional hydrogel (standard HEMA) and silicone-hydrogel contact lenses using a bioluminescent ATP assay. METHODS: Four types of unworn contact lenses (Etafilcon A, Galyfilcon A, Balafilcon A, Lotrafilcon B) were incubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (two different strains) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Lenses were placed with the posterior surface facing up and were incubated in the bacterial suspension for 4 hours at 37 degrees C. Bacterial binding was then measured and studied by bioluminescent ATP assay. Six replicate experiments were performed for each lens and strain. RESULTS: Adhesion of all species of bacteria to standard HEMA contact lenses (Etafilcon A) was found to be significantly lower than that of three types of silicone-hydrogel contact lenses, whereas Lotrafilcon B material showed the highest level of bacterial binding. Differences between species in the overall level of adhesion to the different types of contact lenses were observed. Adhesion of P. aeruginosa was typically at least 20 times greater than that observed with both S. epidermidis strains. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional hydrogel contact lenses exhibit significantly lower bacterial adhesion in vitro than silicone-hydrogel ones. This could be due to the greater hydrophobicity but also to the higher oxygen transmissibility of silicone-hydrogel lenses.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Culture-based bacterial detection systems for platelets: the effect of time prior to sampling and duration of incubation required for detection with aerobic culture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) products occurs at low concentrations requiring a period of incubation for growth to minimize sampling error. Culture-based detection methods also need sufficient incubation time; together these periods may limit the useful life of PLTs. This study characterizes the impact of sampling and detection times with two commercially available bacteria detection products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis PLTs inoculated with nine bacterial species at low concentrations were sampled immediately and 24 hours after inoculation. Test results were analyzed after incubation at 16, 20, and 24 hours after sampling with two bacterial detection systems. RESULTS: When sampled immediately after inoculation, two commercially available bacterial detection systems (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux; and eBDS, Pall Corp.) failed to detect some PLTs inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia liquefaciens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. epidermidis, S. liquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, or P. aeruginosa, respectively. The BacT/ALERT was better at 20 hours (p<0.02), but not at 16 or 24 hours for Time 0 sampling. When sampling occurred 24 hours after inoculation, there were no difference between the two systems. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that for either bacteria detection system, holding PLTs for 24 hours before sampling improves the detection sensitivity for PLTs contaminated with low concentrations of bacteria, and longer incubation periods improve detection.
TI  - Effect of chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride on bacterial biofilm formation.
AB  - AIM: To study the effect of antiseptics on bacterial biofilm formation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biofilm formation and planktonic growth were tested in microtiter plates in the presence of antiseptics. For Escherichia coli G1473 in the presence of chlorhexidine or benzalkonium chloride, for Klebsiella pneumoniae CF504 in the presence of chlorhexidine and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, biofilm development and planktonic growth were affected at the same concentrations of antiseptics. For PAO1 in the presence of chlorhexidine and CF504 in the presence of benzalkonium chloride, planktonic growth was significantly inhibited by a fourfold lower antiseptic concentration than biofilm development. For Staphylococcus epidermidis CIP53124 in the presence of antiseptics at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), a total inhibition of biofilm formation was observed. For Staph. epidermidis exposed to chlorhexidine at 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 MIC, or to benzalkonium chloride at 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 MIC, biofilm formation was increased from 11.4% to 22.5% without any significant effect onto planktonic growth. CONCLUSIONS: Chlorhexidine and benzalkonium chloride inhibited biofilm formation of different bacterial species but were able to induce biofilm development for the Staph. epidermidis CIP53124 strain at sub-MICs. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Sublethal exposure to cationic antiseptics may contribute to the persistence of staphylococci through biofilm induction.
TI  - Sperm motility changes after coincubation with various uropathogenic microorganisms: an in vitro experimental study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between semen motility and various uropathogenic microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semen specimens from healthy donors were divided into portions and incubated with uropathogenic microorganisms in concentrations varying from 2 x 10 to 2 x 10(7) microorganisms/ml(-1). Uninfected suspensions of spermatozoa served as controls. In all samples, sperm motility was examined at the second, fourth, and sixth hours after incubation in order to assess motility as a function of time. Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli were used as bacterial agents. Besides these bacterial strains, Candida albicans was also used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Observed negative impact on sperm motility was not correlated with microorganism concentration. However, until a certain concentration threshold, this impact was prominent. Regardless of the microorganism, this deleterious effect could not be confirmed in specimens coincubated with lower microorganism concentration. No or poor correlation was found between motility and bacteria concentration except with E. aerogenes at the second hour. The data indicates that sperm function impairment is not related to direct sperm and bacteria interaction. Instead, bacterial concentration enough to change the environment or to consume high energy might result in motility loss.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some Salvia species essential oils from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Salvia multicaulis, S. sclarea and S. verticillata were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oils were isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oils were studied against eight Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumulis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of antibacterial activity tests of the essential oils according to the disc diffusion method and MIC values indicated that all the samples have moderate to high inhibitory activity against the tested bacteria except for P. aeruginosa which was totally resistant. In contrast to antibacterial activity, the oils exhibited no or slight antifungal property, in which only the oil of S. multicaulis showed weak activity against two tested yeasts, C. albicans and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and related compounds.
AB  - A systematic survey of the antimicrobial properties of substituted salicylaldehydes and some related aromatic aldehydes is reported. A total of 23 different compounds, each at four different concentrations, were studied using a panel of seven microbes (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and employing the paper disc agar diffusion method. Several aldehydes, most notably halogenated, nitro-substituted and hydroxylated salicylaldehydes, displayed highly potent activity against the microbes studied, giving inhibitory zones up to 49 mm in diameter (paper disc diameter 6 mm), while unsubstituted benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde had minimal activity. Further, 4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldehyde had considerable activity against C albicans and slight activity against S. cerevisiae, while displaying minimal activity against bacteria. Also two aromatic dialdehydes had interesting activity. In general, P. aeruginosa was the least sensitive microbe, a result that is in line with observations from a large screening project, in which this microbe was the one against which the least number of active substances was found. Interestingly, the structure-activity relationships of the aldehydes studied were clearly different for different microbes. Many of the aldehydes tested had such high antimicrobial activity that they are noteworthy candidates for practical applications as well as interesting lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobial drugs and disinfectants. The structure-activity relationships are discussed in detail. For high activity, substituents are required in benzaldehyde as well as in its 2-hydroxy derivative salicylaldehyde. One hydroxy group alone (at the 2-position) is not enough, but further hydroxylation may produce high activity. The effects of substituents are in some cases dramatic. Halogenation, hydroxylation and nitro substitution may produce highly active compounds, but the effects are not easily predicted nor can they be extrapolated from one microbe to another.
TI  - Carbohydrazones of substituted salicylaldehydes as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum antimicrobials.
AB  - Certain substituted salicylaldehydes are known to have highly potent antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, but the mechanism underlying this remarkable activity is not known, and almost nothing has been reported on the effects of further modification of the structures, such as the formation of hydrazone-type derivatives. We report now a study on the antimicrobial properties of the carbohydrazone derivatives of several substituted salicylaldehydes. The compounds studied were synthesized from ring-substituted salicylaldehydes and carbohydrazide in the mole ratio 2:1. They were tested against Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Staphylococcus epidermidis using the agar diffusion method. The carbohydrazone derived from 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde had distinctly higher activity than the parent aldehyde in the same molar concentration. This activity was limited to one test organism (S. epidermidis), while the free aldehyde had at least some (in some cases even high) activity against all of the microbes studied. All other ones of the effective carbohydrazone compounds were distinctly less active than the parent salicylaldehydes as such. The hydrazones studied had in general a narrower antimicrobial spectrum than the free aldehydes and are thus of interest as potential lead compounds for the development of narrow-spectrum anti-microbial drugs. The mechanism of action of the aldehydes as well as that of the carbohydrazones is discussed.
TI  - Biofilm formation on pyrolytic carbon heart valves: influence of surface free energy, roughness, and bacterial species.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the interaction of surface free energy and roughness characteristics of different pyrolytic carbon heart valves with three bacterial species on biofilm formation. METHODS: Three pyrolytic carbon heart valves (St Jude Medical [St Jude Medical Inc, Minneapolis, Minn], Sulzer Carbomedics [CarboMedics Inc, Austin, Tex], and MedicalCV [Medical Incorporated, Inver Grove Heights, Minn]) were tested. Roughness was measured by interferential microscopy and surface free energy by contact angle technique. To obtain a biofilm, prostheses were inserted into a bioreactor with Staphylococcus aureus P209, Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Adhesion was quantified by counting sessile bacteria. Morphologic characteristics of biofilms were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: Roughness analysis revealed significant differences between the MedicalCV (35.18 +/- 4.43 nm) valve and St Jude Medical (11.03 +/- 3.11 nm; P < .0001) and Sulzer Carbomedics (8.80 +/- 1.10 nm; P < .0001) valves. Analysis of surface free energy revealed a higher level for the MedicalCV valve (41.03 mJ x m(-2)) than for both the Sulzer Carbomedics (38.93 mJ x m(-2)) and St Jude Medical (31.51 mJ . m(-2)) models. These results showed a correlation between surface free energy and bacterial adhesion for S epidermidis and P aeruginosa species. Regardless of the support, we observed significant adhesion differences for the three bacterial species. S aureus was the most adherent species, S epidermidis was the least, and P aeruginosa was intermediate. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adhesion of S epidermidis and P aeruginosa are dependent on pyrolytic carbon surface free energy and roughness, although S aureus adhesion appears to be independent of these factors. Improvement of pyrolytic carbon physicochemical properties thus could lead to a reduction in valvular prosthetic infections.
TI  - Mode of antibacterial action of a signal peptide, Pep27 from Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Pep27  and its mode of action. The results indicated Pep27 exhibited antibacterial activities against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without hemolytic effect on human erythrocytes, but it did not exhibit antifungal activity. To understand the mode of action of Pep27, the cellular distribution of the peptide was investigated. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited Pep27 penetrated the bacterial membrane by an energy-independent pathway without any damage to the membrane when examined using liposome and membrane probe. After penetration into the bacterial cells, Pep27 was not affected by macromolecular synthesis, but activated protein phosphatase activity in dose ranges of 10-15 microM and time range of 5-10 min in case of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. These results demonstrated the antibacterial activities of Pep27 are fundamentally attributable to a physiological change by activated phosphatase activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of remifentanil and mixtures of remifentanil and propofol.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity of glycine, which is contained in remifentanil, when combined with propofol. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Departments of anesthesiology and microbiology of a university hospital. MEASUREMENTS: Growth of the microorganisms Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans in propofol 1%; saline dilutions of remifentanil at one-, 10-, and 100-microg/mL concentrations; and 1:1 mixtures of propofol with remifentanil solutions was determined. MAIN RESULTS: Remifentanil inhibits bacterial growth in a concentration-dependent manner. The antibacterial effects were more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at cultures obtained at the fifth hour. The inhibition of bacterial growth was less influenced with Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol and remifentanil mixtures decreased bacterial growth, and combinations may reduce the infectious complications from accidentally contaminated propofol.
TI  - Ocular surface expression and in vitro activity of antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - PURPOSE: Human ocular surface epithelia express four antimicrobial peptides (APs): beta -defensin (hBD) 1-3 and LL-37. Here the expression of additional APs (hBD 4-6, HE2beta 1; histatin-1, -3; liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-1, -2; macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha, and thymosin (T)beta -4) was sought and activity against common ocular pathogens studied. METHODS: AP expression was determined in human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells (HCEC, HCjEC) by RT-PCR and in corneal sections by immunostaining. Antimicrobial assays were performed to assess peptide (hBD 1-3, LL-37, MIP-3alpha, and Tbeta 4) activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) in the presence of NaCl or tears. RESULTS: HCEC and HCjEC expressed MIP-3alpha and Tbeta 4. hBD 1-3, MIP-3alpha, and Tbeta 4 showed activity against PA. hBD-3 had potent activity against SA and SE, whereas hBD-2, MIP-3alpha and Tbeta 4 had moderate activity and hBD-1 had none. NaCl markedly attenuated, and tears almost completely inhibited the activity of hBD 1-2 and Tbeta 4, but not that of hBD-3. CONCLUSIONS: The ocular surface epithelia additionally express MIP-3alpha and Tbeta 4 which have moderate antimicrobial activity. The current data support a role for hBD-3 as an antimicrobial peptide in vivo, but call in to question the effectiveness of some other APs. However, further study is required to conclusively elucidate the physiological role of each AP.
TI  - Penetration of gatifloxacin eye drops into the aqueous humor in humans.
AB  - The authors topically administered gatifloxacin (GFLX) into the eye before cataract surgery and measured the concentrations of this agent to determine its penetration into aqueous humor. Seventy-seven patients with age-related cataracts who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 0.3% GFLX ophthalmic solution 4 times at 30-min intervals, beginning 2 h before surgery. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for GFLX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. The mean intraoperative GFLX concentration in aqueous humor was 0.485 +/- 0.328 microg/mL. GFLX level was 0.573 +/- 0.367 microg/mL in elderly patients, at least 70 years of age, and was significantly higher than that (0.322 +/- 0.135 microg/mL) in the patients less than 70 years old. This concentration was close to or higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations required to inhibit the growth of 90% of major pathogens of endophthalmitis (MIC90), such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis associated with poor prognosis, other than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) in vitro. The GFLX concentrations found in aqueous humor samples were sufficient to kill bacteria other than S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA in vitro.
TI  - Implementation of a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations in Canada.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bacterial screening in apheresis platelet preparations was implemented in March of 2004 by Canadian Blood Services (CBS) using the BacT/ALERT system. The aim of this study was to develop, validate and implement an in-house proficiency testing programme to evaluate CBS performance of bacterial screening in platelet preparations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During development of the proficiency testing programme, apheresis platelet preparations were spiked with 10(1) and 10(2) colony forming units per ml of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The preparations were stored at 2-8 degrees C prior to culture bottle inoculation with 4 or 6 ml on Days 7-10 (estimated time from panel preparation to testing at CBS centres). Upon implementation, a combination of four proficiency panel members, including positives and negatives, were distributed to each of the centres that participated in the programme. A survey was conducted with 43 America's Blood Centers to assess whether they screen for bacterial testing in platelet preparations and whether they have implemented a proficiency testing programme. RESULTS: The development of the proficiency testing programme showed that S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa produced positive results at both concentrations and volumes on Days 7-10 poststorage. Streptococcus pneumoniae did not grow consistently and therefore was not selected for implementation of the programme. Two proficiency testing panel sets have been issued (July 2006 and February 2007) with 14 out of 15 (93%) and 14 out of 14 (100%) of the participant centres meeting the expected results for bacterial screening, respectively. The majority (72%) of the America's Blood Centers that screen for bacterial contamination have not implemented a proficiency testing programme and 94.4% of these centres are interested in developing such a programme. CONCLUSION: Canadian Blood Services has successfully implemented a proficiency testing programme for bacterial screening in platelet preparations, which will contribute to improving the safety of the platelet supply in Canada.
TI  - Intrathecal baclofen does not inhibit the growth of different bacterial species and Candida albicans.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity of intrathecal baclofen was investigated.  Several different microorganisms were used: Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains); S epidermidis; Enterococcus faecalis; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Candida albicans. METHODS: Three experimental approaches were used to assess baclofen antimicrobial activity: (1) determination of the MIC; (2) determination of the MBC; and (3) kinetic time-kill assay. Experiments were performed according to current methods of the NCCLS. RESULTS: As compared with control organisms exposed to physiologic saline, organisms exposed to baclofen over a 10-day period failed to reduce the number of viable cells by at least 3 log(10), as requested by NCCLS criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Because the viability of the investigated organisms was not reduced over that of microbial suspensions exposed to physiologic saline, we conclude that intrathecal baclofen has no measurable activity against different bacterial species and C albicans.
TI  - Biofilm reduction by a new burn gel that targets nociception.
AB  - AIMS: To compare the ability of an amorphous first aid topical gel containing vinegar, citric acid and EDTA (RescuDerm(TM); RESC) and various derivative formulations to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSEUD) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (STAPH) biofilms. METHODS AND RESULTS: 24-h biofilms prepared using the Minimum Biofilm Elimination Concentration (MBEC) Assay System were exposed for 4 or 24 h to the different gel formulations. Citric acid-free, acetic acid-free or acetic acid-free/sodium acetate-supplemented RESC gels reduced PSEUD and STAPH biofilm formation as effectively as RESC. Substituting the weak organic acids with equivalent concentrations of glacial acetic acid reduced the effectiveness of gel against PSEUD and STAPH biofilms by half, but viable bacterial counts still remained below 4 log(10) CFU/peg. Removal of gelling agent and/or EDTA enhanced efficacy against PSEUD but not STAPH biofilms. An acidified placebo gel formulation generated an only marginal bactericidal effect compared to that of RESC. CONCLUSIONS: RESC is a promising new antimicrobial agent. Its weak organic acid content, rather than merely acidic pH, mediates its considerable in vitro bactericidal efficacy against bacterial biofilms. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data, taken together with the observation that RescuDerm possesses broad in vitro bactericidal activity against other pathogen species, suggest the potential usefulness of this product for controlling biofilm formation on a variety of cutaneous traumatic and surgical wounds.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of tramadol against bacteria associated with infectious complications after local or regional anesthesia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tramadol is a synthetic analog of codeine with opioid and local anesthetic properties. It is used as a central-acting analgesic, and recently, in subcutaneous or intradermal injections, as a local anesthetic. We investigated in vitro the antibacterial activity of tramadol in the absence of any local anesthetics against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogens that can cause infectious complications after local or regional anesthesia. METHODS: Bacterial cultures were grown for 18 h, diluted in sterile physiological saline, and incubated for 6 or 24 h at 37 degrees C with 6.25, 12.5, or 25 mg/mL tramadol. The mixtures were then plated onto blood agar and colony counts were recorded after 24 h incubation at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Tramadol had bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. epidermidis compared with controls: at 25 mg/mL for 6 h or at 12.5 mg/mL for 24 h, tramadol decreased by approximately 7 log(10) (P < 0.001) the colony counts of E. coli (100% kill). Similar results were obtained with S. epidermidis, with approximately 6 log(10) reduction (100% kill) when tramadol was used at 25 mg/mL for 24 h (P < 0.001). The antibacterial effect of 25 mg/mL tramadol was lower against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, reducing the growth of these strains by approximately 3log(10) after 24 h (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Tramadol has dose- and time-dependent bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. epidermidis, as well as antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. The antibacterial properties of tramadol may be useful for reducing the risk of bacterial infection after local or regional anesthesia.
TI  - Characterization of biofilm formed on intrauterine devices.
AB  - PURPOSE: Intrauterine device (IUD) is one of the most convenient contraceptive procedures used by women of Asian and African countries. Previous surveys have revealed that 75% of the IUDs recovered from patients suffering from reproductive tract infections (RTIs) were covered with a consortium of microbes. This study was designed to characterize these microbes and recommend remedial measures. METHODS: Quantitative measurement of biofilm formation was assessed by a microtitre plate assay on 86 samples of microorganisms dislodged from IUDs of patients with RTIs. Susceptibility of biofilm to various antimicrobial agents was also quantified. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to scrutinize the microorganisms adherent to IUDs. RESULTS: The organisms associated with IUDs were predominantly composed of Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (18%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), Escherichia coli (27%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (2%), Candida albicans (20%) and Candida dubliniesis (12%). SEM studies indicated that these organisms were organized into biofilms. Studies on the in vitro adherence pattern by crystal violet staining on 96 well microtitre plates revealed that the biofilms were stably established after 60 hours. These biofilms are resistant to an array of antibiotics tested. CONCLUSION: Biofilm formation may be one of the major causes for persistent infection and antibiotic resistance in IUD users.
TI  - Reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive RGD modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  - Ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. Poly(L-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. PLL-g-PEG can be functionalized with bioligands such as RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. Previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized PLL-g-PEG and RGD-peptide functionalized PLL-g-PEG reduced the adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus to titanium (Ti) surfaces. The present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. The different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence light microscopy (FM). The adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on Ti surfaces coated with PLL-g-PEG compared to uncoated Ti surfaces even in the presence of RGD. The percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. Therefore, coating surfaces with PLL-g-PEG/PEG-RGD allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.
TI  - Use of telechelic cis-1,4-polyisoprene cationomers in the synthesis of antibacterial ionic polyurethanes and copolyurethanes bearing ammonium groups.
AB  - New crosslinked ionic polyurethanes and copolyurethanes were yielded by reaction  of telechelic cis-1,4-oligoisoprenes, bearing a variable number of ammonium and hydroxy groups, with isocyanurate of isophorone diisocyanate (I-IPDI). Aiming for a comparative study, polyurethane elastomers based on non-ionic telechelic oligomers were also synthesized. Thermo-mechanical behavior and crosslinking density of these three families of materials were investigated by DMTA and swelling test, respectively. Surface properties were examined by static contact angle measurements and AFM imaging. The bactericidal activity of the polymers was investigated by enumerating living Pseudomonas aeruginosa on material surfaces and on water suspensions. The number of attached living bacteria was found to depend on the chemical structure of the material and on the contact time between the microorganisms and the surface. An exclusive bactericidal activity was obtained with the ionic copolyurethane family. Materials with weak crosslinking density were found to release bactericidal moieties. The abilities of the polymers to prevent bacterial growth were examined through zone of inhibition experiments against P. aeruginosa, which shown a bacteriostatical effect for each synthesized material. These experiments were not sufficiently sensitive to detect the leaching of bactericidal moieties from the materials with weak crosslinking density. When the zone of inhibition experiments was performed on more sensitive bacteria, namely Staphylococcus epidermidis, the leaching of bactericidal moieties as well as bacteriostatic effect was detected. This work demonstrates the potentiality for making functional biomaterials from natural rubber, a renewable resource.
TI  - Bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  - As part of a United States-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001  to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), we obtained 454 pretreatment specimens from 433 patients. After debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the R. M. Alden Research Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. Cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (15.3%), Streptococcus species (15.5%), Enterococcus species (13.5%), Corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). The predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), Prevotella species (13.6%), Porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). Pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of P. aeruginosa cultures. Two or more species of Staphylococcus were present in 13.1% of the patients. Ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and anaerobes. Among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. Moderate-to-severe DFIs are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. Our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.
TI  - [Retrospective study of suppurative keratitis in 1054 patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiological and clinical characteristics of 1054 cases  with suppurative keratitis. METHODS: Medical records of 1054 inpatients with suppurative keratitis at the Qingdao Eye Hospital, Shandong Eye Institute from January 1999 to December 2004 were retrospectively reviewed for the analysis of demographic features, duration of symptoms, risk factors, previous therapy and laboratory findings. RESULTS: Fungal keratitis (61.9%) was the most common type in suppurative keratitis inpatients. Middle aged patients (between 41 - 50 years, 27.3%) and farm workers (82.9%) were the most common groups. Corneal trauma was noted as the most common risk factor. The positive rate of direct microscopic examination of potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mounts was 88.7% for the diagnosis of fungal keratitis, but the positive rate of microscopic examination of Gram staining was only 43.4% in detecting bacterial keratitis. The most common type of fungi isolated was fusarium species (437 cases, 73.3%), followed by aspergillus species (72 cases, 12.1%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacteria (35.7%), followed by staphylococcus epidermidis (22.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Fungal keratitis is the most common type in severe suppurative corneal ulcers and its incidence shows an increasing tendency progressively. As a rapid, simple and effective diagnostic method of fungal keratitis, the application of direct microscopic examination of KOH wet mounts should be used more extensively. A rapid and effective detecting technique of bacterial keratitis is required urgently.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements.
AB  - Evidences supporting the introduction of metallic elements in several biological  processes are rapidly accumulating. Likewise, many drugs possess modified toxicological and pharmacological properties when in the form of metal complexes. In order to ascertain the role of various essential and trace element complexation on the antibacterial activity of various cephalosporins, the synergistic or antagonistic behavior of cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefatrizine and cefpirome in presence of essential and trace elements has been studied and compared with the parent drug. The essential and trace elements comprised of magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, ferric, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and cadmium in the form of their chloride. These studies were carried out by observing the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using agar dilution method and compared with the MIC'S of the standard cephalosporins against various species of Gram (+) and Gram (-) microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysenteriae. Different dilutions of cephalosporins and salts of essential and trace elements were used in these studies. The ratio of the drug and metal salts was 1:1 and the reactions were carried out at two different temperatures as 37 degrees C and 60 degrees C in order to study the complex formation. The aim of our study was on one hand to evaluate the changes in microbiological activity of the standard cephalosporins after in vitro metal interactions to study the synergetic or antagonistic behavior of the later through the difference in MICs values of these cephalosporins and on the other hand to access the bioassay directed extent of drug metal complexations. Our investigation reveal that interaction of above cephalosporins with essential and trace elements cause antagonistic effect in many cases which was shown by decrease in antimicrobial activity of cephalosporins and MIC values were increased.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on zwitterionic surfaces.
AB  - In this work, we report a study of long-chain zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) surfaces grafted via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) for their resistance to bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. Previously, we demonstrated that p(SBMA) is highly resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. Poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (pOEGMA) grafted surfaces were also studied for comparison. Furthermore, we quantify how surface grafting methods will affect the long-term biological performance of the surface coatings. Thus, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols with shorter-chain oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) and mixed SO3-/N+(CH3)3 terminated groups were prepared on gold surfaces. The short-term adhesion (3 h) and the long-term accumulation (24 or 48 h) of two bacterial species (Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa) on these surfaces were studied using a laminar flow chamber. Methyl-terminated (CH3) SAM on gold and a bare glass were chosen as references. p(SBMA) reduced short-term adhesion of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa relative to glass by 92% and 96%, respectively. For long-term biofilm formation, qualitative images showed that p(SBMA) dramatically reduced biofilm formation of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa as compared to glass.
TI  - Effect of oral application of a probiotic E. coli strain on the intestinal microflora of children of allergic mothers during the first year of life.
AB  - Influence of intestinal colonization by a probiotic E. coli strain on the incidence of bacterial pathogens in stool and allergic symptoms during the 1st year of life was monitored in 3 groups: colonized children of allergic mothers (AC; n = 52), noncolonized children of allergic mothers (AN; n = 50), children of nonallergic mothers (NC; n = 42). Colinfant vaccine was administered within 2 d after birth, 3 x a week over a period of 4 weeks. Stool samples were examined after 2 d and at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months. At 3 months E. coli was present in 90 %, at 12 months in 73 % of AC. Pathogens were significantly less frequent on day 3 and at 3 months in AC vs. AN (15 vs. 61 %, p < 0.001; 15 vs. 38 %, p < 0.01) and vs. NC (15 vs. 63 %, p < 0.001; 15 vs. 53 %, p < 0.001). AC exhibited lower incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis than AN on day 3 (6 vs. 31 %, p < 0.001) and of Klebsiella strains on day 3 and at 3 months (4 vs. 20 %, p < 0.05; 5 vs. 24 %, p < 0.01). AC showed a lower incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa than NC on day 3 (6 vs. 31 %, p < 0.01) and Klebsiella spp. on day 3 and at 3 months (4 vs. 22 %, p < 0.05; 5 vs. 45 %, p < 0.001). No significant differences were recorded after 6 and 12 months. The incidence of allergies was 3 % in AC, 26 % in AN (p < 0.01), and 10 % in NC.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of thiosemicarbazones and their Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes.
AB  - Thirty-four thiosemicarbazones and S-alkyl thiosemicarbazones, and some of their  Zn(II) and Pd(II) complexes were obtained and purified to investigate antimicrobial activity. MIC values of the compounds were determined by the disc diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida albicans. The thiosemicarbazones show antibacterial and antifungal effects in free ligand and metal-complex form. Picolinaldehyde-S-methyl- and -S-benzylthiosemicarbazones did not affect the tested microorganisms but their Zn(II) complexes showed selective activity. The antimicrobial activity is relatively high in Me2SO, but the antimicrobial potential is changed in a certain range with Me2SO, HCONMe2, EtOH and CHCl3.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine and metal complexes of 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A series of 2-benzylideneaminonaphthothiazoles were designed and synthesized incorporating the lipophilic naphthalene ring to render them more capable of penetrating various biomembranes. METHODS: Schiff bases were synthesized by the reaction of naphtha[1,2-d]thiazol-2-amine with various substituted aromatic aldehydes. 2-(2'-Hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole was converted to its Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal complexes upon treatment with metal salts in ethanol. All the compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities by paper disc diffusion method with Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of all the Schiff bases and metal complexes were determined by agar streak dilution method. RESULTS: All the compounds moderately inhibited the growth of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. In the present study among all Schiff bases 2-(2'-hydroxy)benzylideneaminonaphthothiazole showed maximum inhibitory activity and among metal complexes Cu(II) metal complex was found to be most potent. CONCLUSION: The results obtained validate the hypothesis that Schiff bases having substitution with halogens, hydroxyl group and nitro group at phenyl ring are required for the antibacterial activity while methoxy group at different positions in the aromatic ring has minimal role in the inhibitory activity. The results also indicated that the metal complexes are better antibacterial agents as compared to the Schiff bases.
TI  - Comparison of the antibacterial activity of honey from different provenance against bacteria usually isolated from skin wounds.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples provided by apiarists and honey packers was tested against microorganisms usually isolated from skin wounds. The antibacterial activity was tested using the well-agar diffusion assay. The honey samples were tested without dilution, and at 75, 50, 30, and 10% (w/v) dilution. Most of the undiluted honey samples inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Some honey samples provided by apiarists also inhibited the growth of S. aureus even at 50% dilution. Undiluted honey samples also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus uberis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although to a lesser extent. No inhibition of Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis growth was detected. The diameters of the inhibition zones generated by honey samples provided by apiarists were larger than those generated by honey samples provided by honey packers. This observation may be explained by considering the provenance of the honey samples.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of positive and negative polarity low-voltage pulsed current (LVPC) on six typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens of chronic wounds.
AB  - The positive effect of electrical stimulation (ES) on wound healing has been shown in vitro and in vivo. On the basis of increased blood flow, protein denaturation, and stimulation of cellular defense, an antibacterial effect of ES is to be expected. Although the antibacterial effect of ES already has been demonstrated in vitro, little attention has been paid to the direct antibacterial effect of changing polarity of the applied current. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of positive and negative monophasic low-voltage pulsed current on typical Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens of chronic wounds. Using the Dermapulse-System, three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia faecium) organisms were tested against positive and negative polarity low voltage pulsed current. All tested organisms were significantly reduced by ES. The reduction differed significantly between positive polarity and control and negative polarity and control, with the highest log10 reduction factor (RF) achieved with positive polarity. Using positive polarity, the maximum RF was measured for E. coli (median log10 RF 0.83; 25th percentile 0.59, 75th percentile 0.98) and the lowest for S. epidermidis (median log10 RF 0.20; 25th percentile 0.17, 75th percentile 0.24). Yet, there was no significant difference with positive ES against Gram-positive or Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - The effect of octylglucoside and sodium cholate in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion to soft contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: In this study, the effect of the natural surfactants octylglucoside and  sodium cholate in inhibiting Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhesion to conventional and silicone-hydrogel contact lenses (CL) was assessed. Hydrophobicity was also evaluated to conditioned and nonconditioned CL. METHODS: The inhibiting effect of the tested surfactants was determined through "in vitro" adhesion studies to conditioned and nonconditioned CL followed by image acquisition and cell enumeration. Hydrophobicity was evaluated through contact angle measurements using the advancing type technique on air. RESULTS: Sodium cholate exhibits a very low capability to inhibit microbial adhesion. Conversely, octylglucoside effectively inhibited microbial adhesion in both types of lenses. This surfactant exhibited an even greater performance than a multipurpose lens care solution used as control. Octylglucoside was the only tested surfactant able to lower the hydrophobicity of all CL, which can explain its high performance. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study point out the potential of octylglucoside as a conditioning agent to prevent microbial colonization.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of conjunctiva, contact lens storage cases and solutions during contact lens wear.
AB  - A total of 90 subjects were investigated in this study, out of which 51 constituted the contact lens wearing group and 39 constituted the control group who had never worn contact lenses. Out of 51 contact lens wearing group, 41 were asymptomatic lens wearer subjects and 10 were symptomatic lens wearer subjects having some complications. All the subjects of contact lens wearing group had worn soft contact lenses on daily wear basis for a duration of 7 days to one year. In total 33 subjects were culture positive and remaining 57 culture negative. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated equally from asymptomatic and control group, however, significantly more gram negative organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were isolated from the symptomatic lens wearers. P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens could also be isolated from lens storage cases. S. marcescens was the organism most commonly isolated from the contact lens solutions. Further, the results showed that both P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens adhere to injured cornea only and not to normal cornea when microscopic study of adherence of bacteria to uninjured and injured ex vivo mouse corneas was done.
TI  - [Preoperatively administered flomoxef sodium concentration in aqueous humor].
AB  - PURPOSE: We intravenously administered flomoxef sodium (FMOX) 0.5-3.5 hours before cataract surgery and measured the concentration of the agent in the aqueous humor to investigate its penetration into the aqueous humor and its efficacy in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis. METHODS: 56 patients who underwent cataract surgery were enrolled in this study. They received 1 g FMOX via a 20-minute intravenous drip beginning 0.5-3.5 hours before the operation. Aqueous humor was aspirated from the anterior chamber and assayed for FMOX concentration using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The mean intraoperative FMOX concentrations in the patients' aqueous humor were 0.79 +/- 0.24 microg/ml (administered 3.5 hours before surgery)--1.47 0.79 microg/ml (administered 1.5 hours before surgery). These concentrations administered 0.5-3.0 hours before surgery sufficiently exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 90 values against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes, but did not achieve the MIC90 values against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The FMOX concentrations in the aqueous humor sampling were adequate to kill bacteria in vitro. This drug may be efficacious in the prevention of postoperative endophthalmitis in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of different gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of different trademarks and compositions of gutta-percha points and calcium hydroxide pastes used in endodontic therapy. The evaluated material consisted of gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (Roeko), gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine (Roeko), two conventional gutta-percha points (Endo Points and Roeko) and two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC). Antimicrobial tests included five species of microorganisms: Escherichia coli (ATCC10538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC6538), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Micrococcus luteus (ATCC9341). The Agar diffusion method was employed. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel was added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. Statistical evaluation was carried out using analysis of variance and Tukey Test. The obtained results showed that all microbial species used in the study were inhibited by the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine and by the calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calen/PMCC), with similar results (p > 0.05). No antimicrobial activity was observed for the other groups. It was concluded that the gutta-percha points containing chlorhexidine presented antimicrobial activity, whereas the gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide did not.
TI  - [Etiological factors of vascular grafts infections and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - THE AIM: of our study was the identification of microorganisms causing vascular graft infections and the evaluation of their antimicrobial susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 25 patients with infected vascular graft, took part in our research. In 19 patients late type of infection was recognized, in 6 the infection was qualified as early. Purulent discharge obtained from the fistula was inoculated on the bacteriological media. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be the most frequently isolated microorganisms. Mixed infection, caused by two distinct bacteria, occurred in 5 patients; in all cases one species belonged to Gram-positive, and the second one to Gram-negative bacteria. In 50% of patients with early type infection different species of Gram-negative rods were present, in 37,5% of them S. aureus and S. epidermidis were isolated. In late type infection Gram-negative rods were isolated from 54,5% of patients and Gram-positive bacteria from 31,5% of patients. The most frequently isolated species appeared to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The isolated species of bacteria varied depending on the degree of infection (according to Shilagy and Samson). CONCLUSIONS: A diversity of isolated species, the presence of mixed infections and resistance patterns typical for hospital flora among bacteria infecting vascular grafts cause that antibiotic therapy should always be based on the results of microbiological examination.
TI  - Effect of ovotransferrin, protamine sulfate and EDTA combination on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of a composition comprising ovotransferrin (OT), protamine sulfate (PS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The in vitro activity of OT, PS and EDTA alone and in combinations against biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated. All the three compounds either alone or in combinations failed to inhibit the growth completely at the concentrations tested. However, the subinhibitory concentrations of three compounds in a composition showed synergistic inhibitory effect on biofilm formation by K. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis. Furthermore, 79-95% reduction in Ps. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis biofilm formation was observed in a clear vinyl urinary catheter treated with the composition. CONCLUSION: The subinhibitory concentrations of OT, PS and EDTA in a composition were effective in reducing biofilm formation by catheter-associated bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows that a synergistic composition-comprising non-antibiotic generally regarded as safe (GRAS) compounds such as OT, PS and EDTA may be used in the prevention of catheter-related infections.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from severe infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Italy: a nationwide study in the hospital setting.
AB  - The most frequent agents of severe bacterial infections and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns were determined in patients admitted to 45 Italian hospitals over the years 2002-2003. The most common diagnoses were: sepsis (33.8%), pneumonia (9.4%), intravascular catheter-associated infections (9.3%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (8.1%). Overall, 5115 bacterial isolates were identified from 4228 patients. Three bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, accounted for more than 50% of the isolates. Other prevalent bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, while Acinetobacter baumanii ranked third among all Intensive Care Unit (ICU) isolates. 7% of S. aureus had intermediate resistance to vancomycin. Although E. faecalis displayed no vancomycin resistance, 34% of vancomycin-resistant isolates were found among Enterococcus faecium, one of the highest rates found to date, emphasizing the difference between these two enterococcal species. All the Gram-positive pathogens were susceptible to linezolid, with the exception of approximately 2% of the enterococcal isolates that were intermediate with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)=4 microg/ml. Almost 10% of Escherichia coli, 14% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22% of Serratia marcescens and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae were non-susceptible to cefotaxime. Amikacin was the most active antibiotic against P. aeruginosa that showed lack of susceptibility to ceftazidime, gentamicin, piperacillin and ciprofloxacin ranging from 20 to 35%. Finally, Acinetobacter baumanii showed a high level of resistance to all the antibiotics tested including imipenem (58%). The results obtained in this study, the first of its kind in Italy, offer indications for guiding empirical therapy and implementing specific interventions to fight antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and their transmission in the hospital setting in Italy.
TI  - Some bivalent metal complexes of Schiff bases containing N and S donor atoms.
AB  - Schiff bases have been synthesized by the reaction of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, o-nitrobenzaldehyde and p-toluyaldehyde with 4-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole. The ligands react with Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metals to yield (1:1) and (1:2) [metal:ligand] complexes. Elemental analyses, IR, 1H NMR, electronic spectral data, magnetic susceptibility measurements, molar conductivity measurements and thermal studies have investigated the structure of the ligands and their metal complexes. The electronic spectral data suggests octahedral geometry for Co(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II). The antibacterial activities of the ligands and their metal complexes have been screened in vitro against three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis) and two Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. The coordination of the metal ion had a pronounced effect on the microbial activities of the ligands and the metal complexes have higher antimicrobial effect than the free ligands.
TI  - Flow cytometric viability assessment and transmission electron microscopic morphological study of bacteria in glycerol.
AB  - Human cadaveric skin allografts are used in the treatment of burns and can be preserved in glycerol at high concentrations. Previously, glycerol has been attributed some antimicrobial effect. In an experimental set-up, we aimed at investigating this effect of prolonged incubation of bacteria in 85% glycerol. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus subtilis were incubated in 85% glycerol. The influence of duration of incubation and temperature on ultrastructure and viability were investigated. Unstressed cultures served as controls. Survival was studied after 24-36 h and 10 days incubation in 85% glycerol at 4 degrees C and 36 degrees C with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and flow cytometry using viability stains indicating membrane damage (SYTO9, propidium iodide) or esterase activity (carboxyfluorescein diacetate). TEM clearly demonstrated variability in morphological changes of bacteria suggesting different mechanisms of damage. Viability stains supported these findings with faster declining viable cell populations in 85% glycerol at 36 degrees C compared with 4 degrees C. Both methods demonstrated that Gram-negative species were more susceptible than Gram-positive species. In conclusion, 85% glycerol may have some additional antimicrobial effect. Temperature is an important factor herein and Gram-negatives are most susceptible. The latter finding probably reflects the difference in cell wall composition between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Growth inhibition of Trichophyton species by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to inhibit the growth  of Trichophyton mentagrophytes (TM) and Trichophyton rubrum (TR). DESIGN: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, or Staphylococcus epidermidis were grown in co-culture with either TM or TR. SETTING: An academic medical center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The total fungal units and hyphal-spore ratio were measured at days 1, 5, 10, and 15. RESULTS: There was a 73% and 46% reduction of total fungal units and a final hyphal-spore ratio of 0.16 and 0.04, respectively, when TM and TR were co-cultured with P aeruginosa. The number of fungal units increased when TM and TR were cultured with E coli (28% and 42%, respectively), S epidermidis (13% and 18%, respectively), and control media (44% and 62%, respectively), and the hyphal-spore ratio increased to above 30 in the presence of S epidermidis, E coli, and control media. CONCLUSION: Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits growth inhibitory properties against TM and TR.
TI  - The effect of bacterial contamination on neointimal hyperplasia in vascular grafts.
AB  - Neointimal hyperplasia (NH) is the most significant contributing factor to long-term vascular graft failure. Inflammation is known to be important in its development; however, the role of bacterial infection is unclear. We examined the effect of contamination with common organisms on the development of NH in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Thirty adult pigs were randomized into one of four groups: no infection, contamination with Staphylococcus aureus, mucin-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. An expanded polytetrafluoroethylene graft (6 mm x 3 cm) was placed as a common iliac artery interposition graft and was inoculated with 1-2 x 10(8) of the selected organism before closure. Grafts were explanted 6 weeks postoperatively. Microbiologic, histological, and morphometric evaluations were performed. All grafts were patent at the time of euthanasia. The mean areas of NH were 5.45 mm(2) in sterile grafts, 8.36 mm(2) in S. aureus, 7.63 mm(2) in S. epidermidis, and 11.52 mm(2) in P. aeruginosa grafts. Comparison of means via analysis of variance showed that P. aeruginosa grafts had significantly higher formation of NH than sterile grafts (P = 0.025). NH production in infected grafts appears to be organism specific and is significantly higher with P. aeruginosa than common Gram-positive organisms. Increased NH from subclinical infection may be a significant factor contributing to late graft failures.
TI  - Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. METHODS: In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.
TI  - Antibacterial Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff bases derived from fluorobenzaldehyde and triazoles.
AB  - Antibacterial Schiff bases derived from 1,2,4-triazoles as well as their metal complexes incorporating cobalt(II), nickel(II), copper(II) and zinc(II) have been synthesized and characterized. Physico-chemical studies suggest that an octahedral geometry for the cobalt(II), nickel(II) and zinc(II)and square-planer geometry for the copper(II) complexes. These complexes have been screened for antibacterial activity against three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bacillus subtilis) and two Gram-negative (Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial strains, and results compared with the activity of the free ligands. The metal complexes were found to be more potent against one or more bacterial strains than the free ligands.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aerobic bacteria in chronic discharging ears and determine their antibiotic susceptibilities, which is essential for reasonable empiric treatment. METHODS: Ear swabs of discharging ears aseptically collected from 102 patients of various age groups attending Ear, Nose, and Throat out-patient clinic at University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital were cultured for bacterial agents using blood agar, chocolate agar and MacConkey agar. Culture plates were incubated aerobically at 37 degrees C for 24-48 hours. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological methods. Members of the family enterobacteriaceae were identified using enterotubes. Antibiotic susceptibility test was carried out for 13 drugs using disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of the patients studied were in the age group 0-14 years and there were more male infants than females. Gram negative bacteria comprised 75% of the isolates. Predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (41%), Proteus sp. (22%), Staphylococcus aureus (22%), Escherichia coli and other coliforms (11%). Drug susceptibility profile of the isolates showed that ceftazidime, ceftriazone and gentamycin were most effective drugs in vitro. CONCLUSION: The predominant bacterial agents in chronic discharging ears in Port Harcourt, Nigeria were gram negative bacteria and included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Escherichia coli. Gram positive bacterial constituted 25 percent of the isolates and included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. Ceftazidime, ceftrixone and gentamycin were the most effective drugs in vitro.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenoids from hairy roots of Salvia sclarea L.: salvipisone as a potential anti-biofilm agent active against antibiotic resistant Staphylococci.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of crude dichloromethane fractions from acetone extracts of Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed roots and roots of field-grown plants of Salvia sclarea as well as four pure abietane diterpenoids isolated from the hairy root cultures were determined. The growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis) but not Gram-negative ones (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) or pathogenic fungi (Candida albicans) was inhibited by fractions tested at concentrations of 37.5-75.0 microgml(-1). Abietane diterpenoids: salvipisone, aethiopinone, 1-oxoaethiopinone and ferruginol were shown to be bacteriostatic as well as bacteriocidal for the cultures of S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains, regardless of their antibiotic susceptibility profile. This was demonstrated by using simultaneously the optical density measuring method and 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide-reduction assay. The highest activity was shown by salvipisone which demonstrated also a very interesting activity when its effect on 24-h-old staphylococcal biofilm cells viability was examined. It limited the survival of biofilms formed by S. aureus as well as by S. epidermidis, putting this compound to the list of potential anti-biofilm agents, better than most of known antibiotics.
TI  - An alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  - The ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. Therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. The colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. Unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. In this article, we propose an alternative method based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples. The method is based on a systematic treatment of FTIR spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. It is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). In parallel, the amide II band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the C-H stretching region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. Therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide II or C-H stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. This method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and DNA. Results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in biofilms can be identified. The proposed FTIR approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and in vitro biological studies of novel cyano derivatives of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine.
AB  - Cyano derivatives of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine have been synthesized and screened for antibacterial and antifungal activities. All the synthesized compounds showed the antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MTCCB 737), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCCB 741), Streptomyces epidermidis (MTCCB 1824) and Escherichia coli (MTCCB 1652) and antifungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus fumigatus (ITCC 4517), Aspergillus flavus (ITCC 5192) and Aspergillus niger (ITCC 5405). All compounds showed mild to moderate antimicrobial activity. However, compounds 3c, 4a and 6 showed potent antibacterial activity against pathogenic strains used in the study. Compounds 3a, 3b, 4b, and 4d showed mild to moderate antifungal activity against Aspergillus pathogenic strains. The compounds reported in this study were assessed for there cytotoxicity using MTT colorimetric assay on Hela cells. All the compounds showed cell viability more than the control drug gentamicin, with compound 2 having highest i.e. 95% cell viability.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition of the essential oil of Gontscharovia popovii from Iran.
AB  - The aerial parts of Gontscharovia popovii (B. Fedtsch. and Gontsch.) Boriss. were collected at full flowering stage. The essential oil was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed by a combination of capillary GC and GC-MS. Thirty-one components were identified with the main constituent being carvacrol (71.9%), followed by linalool (5.5%), p-cymene (4.5%) and gamma-terpinene (4.4%). The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of G. popovii was studied against seven Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three fungi (Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus niger). The results of the bioassays showed that the oil exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against all the tested fungi and bacteria except for the resistant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Microevolution of cytochrome bd oxidase in Staphylococci and its implication in resistance to respiratory toxins released by Pseudomonas.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are opportunistic pathogens and  frequently coinfect the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa secretes an arsenal of small respiratory inhibitors, like pyocyanin, hydrogen cyanide, or quinoline N-oxides, that may act against the commensal flora as well as host cells. Here, we show that with respect to their susceptibility to these respiratory inhibitors, staphylococcal species can be divided into two groups: the sensitive group, comprised of pathogenic species such as S. aureus and S. epidermidis, and the resistant group, represented by nonpathogenic species such as S. carnosus, S. piscifermentans, and S. gallinarum. The resistance in the latter group of species was due to cydAB genes that encode a pyocyanin- and cyanide-insensitive cytochrome bd quinol oxidase. By exchanging cydB in S. aureus with the S. carnosus-specific cydB, we could demonstrate that CydB determines resistance. The resistant or sensitive phenotype was based on structural alterations in CydB, which is part of CydAB, the cytochrome bd quinol oxidase. CydB represents a prime example of both microevolution and the asymmetric pattern of evolutionary change.
TI  - Microbial isolates in early swabs of open musculoskeletal injuries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections of open musculoskeletal injuries, especially open fractures, continue to pose a challenge to the Orthopaedic and Trauma surgeons. There is a dearth of information on the early bacterial contaminants of these open wounds and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns in our environment. OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacteriology of open wounds of the musculoskeletal system at initial presentation in hospital and their antibiotic susceptibility profile in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study of 86 consecutive patients over an eight-month period (March to October 2002). Eighty-six patients with 96 open wounds of the musculoskeletal system admitted to the Accident and Emergency unit of the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife. Bacteria were isolated from swabs taken from the depth of the wounds and their antibiotic susceptibility determined. RESULTS: A total of 126 bacterial isolates were recovered from 96 wounds in 86 patients (61 males and 25 females) with mean age of 31.4 years +/- SD. About 73.3% of the wounds were from road traffic accidents and 72.3% of the wounds were severe open fractures (Grades IIIA to C). Staphylococcus aureus constituted 22.2% while coagulase negative Staphylococci (CONS) accounted for 21.4% with Staphylococcus. epidermidis leading the group with 13.5%. Gram negative rods constituted 40.5% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for 11.1%. Antibiotic sensitivity profile revealed that many of the isolates were multiply resistant to the antimicrobials employed but were sensitive to Ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that open wounds of the musculoskeletal system are usually contaminated at presentation with pathogenic organisms. The antibiotic sensitivity pattern of the isolates shows that the quinolones, represented by Ofloxacin, is the most effective antibiotic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some ethnomedicinal plants used by Paliyar tribe from Tamil Nadu, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial activity of 18 ethnomedicinal plant extracts were evaluated against nine bacterial strains (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ervinia sp, Proteus vulgaris) and one fungal strain (Candida albicans). The collected ethnomedicinal plants were used in folk medicine in the treatment of skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders. METHODS: Plants were collected from Palni hills of Southern Western Ghats and the ethnobotanical data were gathered from traditional healers who inhabit the study area. The hexane and methanol extracts were obtained by cold percolation method and the antimicrobial activity was found using paper disc diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India. RESULTS: The results indicated that out of 18 plants, 10 plants exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more of the tested microorganisms at three different concentrations of 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/disc. Among the plants tested, Acalypha fruticosa, Peltophorum pterocarpum, Toddalia asiatica,Cassia auriculata, Punica granatum and Syzygium lineare were most active. The highest antifungal activity was exhibited by methanol extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum and Punica granatum against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the some ethnomedicinal plants used in folkloric medicine. Compared to hexane extract, methanol extract showed significant activity against tested organisms. This study also showed that Toddalia asiatica, Syzygium lineare, Acalypha fruticosa and Peltophorum pterocarpum could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the fluorescence quantitative PCR assay targeting 16S rDNA].
AB  - The 16S rDNA specific primers were designed for rapid detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) by the fluorescence quantitative PCR (FQ-PCR) assay, based upon multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis of the 16S rDNAs of over 20 bacteria. After extraction of PA genomic DNA, the target 16S rDNA fragment was amplified by PCR with specific primers, and used to construct recombinant pMDT-Pfr plasmid, the dilution gradients of which were subjected to the standard quantitation curve in FQ-PCR assay. Different concentrations of PA genomic DNA were detected by FQ-PCR in a 20microL of reaction system with SYBR Green I. At the same time, various genomic DNAs of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used as negative controls to confirm specificity of the FQ-PCR detection assay. Results demonstrated that the predicted amplified product of designed primers was of high homology only with PA 16S rDNA, and that sensitivity of the FQ-PCR assay was of 3.6pg/microL of bacterial DNA or (2.1 x 10(3) +/- 3.1 x 10(2)) copies/microL of 16S rDNA, accompanied with high specificity, and that the whole detection process including DNA extraction could be completed in about two hours. In contrast to traditional culture method, the FQ-PCR assay targeting 16S rDNA gene can be used to detect PA rapidly, which exhibits perfect application prospect in future.
TI  - [Malignant external otitis].
AB  - Malignant external otitis or skull base osteomyelitis and osteoradionecrosis of the skull base and the skull are potentially life-threatening conditions. The standard methods of treatment involve the use of antibiotics, local treatment and, where necessary, surgical excision of necrotic tissue. These approaches do not provide a complete cure in many cases. Severe functional deficits and even death can occur in advanced stages. We conducted a long-term retrospective follow-up study and report on a multimodal approach that we have been using with great success since 1987. The four cornerstones of this treatment are surgical debridement, combinations of antibiotics, specific immunoglobulins, and adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This multimodal treatment approach has proved to be highly effective in improving the survival and quality of life of the patients concerned. These excellent outcomes justify the high costs that this therapy admittedly involves.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial activity of pyrazolylbisindoles--promising anti-fungal compounds.
AB  - A series of pyrazolylbisindole derivatives have been synthesized by reacting substituted pyrazole aldehydes with substituted indoles using phosphotungstic acid, a Keggin type heteropoly acid as catalyst. The synthesized pyrazolylbisindoles were evaluated for anti-microbial activities. The effect of pyrazolylbisindoles on the mycelial growth of plant pathogenic fungi is revealed. Entries 3c and 3d emerged as the most interesting compounds in this series exhibiting excellent anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Construction of a leftover bath water model for microbial testing.
AB  - In this study, in order to construct a model of leftover bath water, we analyzed  one hundred samples of used bath water samples which were provided by twenty-eight volunteer families. It appeared that the number of detected bacteria from such bath water was correlated closely with the number of bathers. Moreover, the pH, acidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ion, protein content of the leftover bath water were measured. The number of bathers had no connection with the pH, acidity, COD, and ion content of the leftover bath water. However, the protein content of the bath water correlated with the number of detected bacteria. Based on these results, the model of leftover bath water was constructed. Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were incubated with the model bath water as indices of bath water contamination. The number of incubated viable cells in the model bath water increased with increasing concentrations of casamino acid. Consequently, it was suggested that varying the concentration of casamino acid based on family size or contamination would be necessary in the efficient use of the constructed model of leftover bath water for microbial testing.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal efficacy of a new sun- and heat burn gel.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro bactericidal efficacy of a new sunburn gel (Rescudermtrade mark; RESC) against planktonic and sessile Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSEUD) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (STAPH). While PSEUD levels were 4log(10) lower than those of STAPH within 24h of adding RESC to contaminated nutrient broths, all bacterial counts were comparable by 48h. PSEUD and STAPH levels were then measured after applying either a single or three consecutive aliquots of RESC to polyurethane sponges. Gel was removed after 5 or 20min, or left on for 72h. Bacterial counts in placebo-treated sponges had plateaued by 24h to values above 9log(10)CFU/mL. In contrast, six out of seven of the RESC application modalities reduced bacterial levels below 4log(10)CFU/mL for 72h. RESC remained effective against STAPH despite up to a 24h treatment delay, irrespective of the number of applications. Repeated RESC applications were required to maintain PSEUD below 4log(10)CFU/mL when the delay exceeded 7h. These data demonstrate the differential susceptibility of planktonic and sessile bacteria to RescuDermtrade mark. This product might be a good candidate for reducing the opportunity for wound infection, especially in burns.
TI  - Microbiological study of cosmetic products during their use by consumers: health  risk and efficacy of preservative systems.
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the microbial contamination of 91 cosmetics (23 o/w emulsions, 47 tensiolytes, 21 aqueous pastes) in three different states of use (intact, in-use, ending product) and the protection efficacy of the preservative systems most frequently used in the analysed cosmetic formulations. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total bacterial count, isolation and identification of pathogenic isolates were performed on the collected cosmetics. About 10.6% of tensiolytes (13.5% bath foam, 6.7% shampoo, 10% liquid soaps) were contaminated by Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas putida. The efficacy of the preservative systems of two cosmetic products, tested against standard micro-organisms (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 4338 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027) and two isolates from cosmetics in this study (S. epidermidis and P. putida), satisfied the Cosmetics, Toiletries, and Fragrance Association and Official Italian Pharmacopeia criteria, while only one tested cosmetic respected the Rapid Challenge Test criterion. CONCLUSIONS: Contaminated cosmetic products are relatively uncommon, but some products, unable to suppress the growth of several micro-organisms, represent a potential health hazard. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The challenge test may be performed not only during the preparation of the preservative system in the intact cosmetics, but also be used to evaluate the protection efficacy during their use.
TI  - New trends in prosthesis infection in cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult cardiovascular surgery entails, in many cases, the use of some  kind of prosthesis. Among the potential complications, prosthetic device infection is one of the most devastating in incidence, as well as in prognosis and damage to surrounding tissues. RESULTS: The most common bacterial agents in vascular and cardiac prosthetic device infections are Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis among gram-positive bacteria and Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa among gram-negative bacteria. CONCLUSION: The alternative modalities of treatment for prosthetic device infection encompass partial or total explantation of the prosthesis and its replacement with an infection-resistant graft (e.g., homologous tissue, autologous tissue, or synthetic prosthesis bonded with antibiotics).
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. Clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. METHODS: Non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the Phoenix system in 2003-2005. Epidemiologic data were extracted using Epicenter and Powerlab. During selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: The specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). Isolates of Escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally declined. Highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. A significant increase was seen in infections attributable to S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. The overall number of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. It appeared that the TEM-92 determinant moved from Enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.
TI  - Surgical site infections in day surgery settings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because major complications are rare in day surgery, minor morbidities such as surgical site infections, which become evident only after patient discharge, have a major impact on the perceived quality of care. We performed an audit of such infections over a oneyear period. METHODS: All procedures were performed in a multidisciplinary day surgery setting. There were 155 inguinal hernia repairs, 44 excisions of lipomas, and 27 excisions of pilonidal cysts. All patients received antibiotic prophylaxis according to a rotation protocol. RESULTS: One patient (0.65%) operated on for inguinal hernia developed a deep incisional infection caused by Staphylococcus schleiferi. The patient was treated using selective antibiotics, and complete recovery ensued. One patient (2.27%) who underwent excision of a lipoma revealed developed a deep incisional infection associated with fever (39 degrees C) caused by Staphylococcus aureus. He was treated by daily antibiotics and application of dressings for two weeks and recovered. One patient (3.7%) treated for pilonidal cyst developed a deep incisional surgical site infection. A group A Streptococcus was isolated, and he received an intravenous antibiotic for ten days. In the seven patients treated for pilonidal cyst with the wound left open, swab specimens were taken because of persisting local pain, and the following bacteria were found: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus constellatus. No antibiotic therapy was given, and local wound care led to complete recovery. CONCLUSION: In our day surgery unit, the rates of surgical site infection are similar to those described in the literature. Continuing audit is essential to maintain and improve the quality and standard of the surgery provided. Prevention of surgical site infection is very much the responsibility of the persons working in the operating theater. Therefore, it is vital not only to apply strict regulations concerning everyday management but also to maintain a high degree of motivation among the personnel.
TI  - Nature of bacteria found on some wards in Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Oman.
AB  - This study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. One hundred swab specimens collected from children's toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. Colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. Of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), Acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), Serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), Pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), Chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). Although all the Serratia, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. Chryseobacterium and Stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of Pseudomonas species were resistant. All the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. Although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. These measures are necessary to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not allowed to spread in the hospital.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. from Iran.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oil of Dicyclophora persica Boiss. was  identified by GC and GC-MS analysis. The analysis of the oil resulted in the identification of forty-five components constituting 98.6% of the total oil. The main constituents were a-pinene (31.5%), (Z)-beta-ocimene (23.3%), p-cymene (6.7%) and (E)-beta-ocimene (5.4%). The antimicrobial activity of the oil was tested by the disk diffusion method against four Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis) and three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria together with a fungus (Aspergillus niger). The oil showed strong inhibition activity toward all the tested microorganisms except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - An in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. METHOD: Three bioxygenating hydrogels were tested: Oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and Iodozyme 402 and Iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with Iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. Cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. Cut squares of control or test dressings were placed on top of each disk. Kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. RESULTS: Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. The order of sensitivity for Oxyzyme was Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (Iodozyme 402, followed by Iodozyme 401 and then Oxyzyme) was the same regardless of the target species. CONCLUSION: The novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.
TI  - Automated detection and quantitation of bacterial RNA by using electrical microarrays.
AB  - Low-density electrical 16S rRNA specific oligonucleotide microarrays and an automated analysis system have been developed for the identification and quantitation of pathogens. The pathogens are Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are typically involved in urinary tract infections. Interdigitated gold array electrodes (IDA-electrodes), which have structures in the nanometer range, have been used for very sensitive analysis. Thiol-modified oligonucleotides are immobilized on the gold IDA as capture probes. They mediate the specific recognition of the target 16S rRNA by hybridization. Additionally three unlabeled oligonucleotides are hybridized in close proximity to the capturing site. They are supporting molecules, because they improve the RNA hybridization at the capturing site. A biotin labeled detector oligonucleotide is also allowed to hybridize to the captured RNA sequence. The biotin labels enable the binding of avidin alkaline phophatase conjugates. The phosphatase liberates the electrochemical mediator p-aminophenol from its electrically inactive phosphate derivative. The electrical signals were generated by amperometric redox cycling and detected by a unique multipotentiostat. The read out signals of the microarray are position specific current and change over time in proportion to the analyte concentration. If two additional biotins are introduced into the affinity binding complex via the supporting oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of the assays increase more than 60%. The limit of detection of Escherichia coli total RNA has been determined to be 0.5 ng/microL. The control of fluidics for variable assay formats as well as the multichannel electrical read out and data handling have all been fully automated. The fast and easy procedure does not require any amplification of the targeted nucleic acids by PCR.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to zirconium alloys.
AB  - We present data and analyses concerning the adhesion of clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (bacteria) and Candida albicans (yeast) to Zircaloy-2 (Zry-2) and Zircadyne-705 (Zr705) surfaces. These zirconium-based materials are similar to those now being used in total hip and knee replacements. Here we study clinical strains of microbes under shaken and stationary exposure conditions, and their ability to adhere to Zr surfaces having different oxide thicknesses. We use X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), viable counts, endotoxin assays, and statistical analysis methods, and demonstrate a predictive model for microbial adhesion based on XPS data.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of cefazolin and povidone-iodine 5% in eradicating microbial organisms adhered to broad scleral buckles.

TI  - Antimicrobial and toxicological profile of the new biocide Akacid plus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Akacid plus is a new member of the polymeric guanidine family of disinfectants. It was especially developed to enhance the antimicrobial activity of this class with significantly less toxicity. The in vitro activity of Akacid plus compared with chlorhexidine digluconate and mupirocin was tested against a total of 369 recent clinical isolates. METHODS: The organisms tested by CLSI reference methods included the following: Staphylococcus aureus (98), Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Bacillus spp. (2), Enterococcus faecalis (32), Klebsiella spp. (45), Enterobacter spp. (20), Escherichia coli (65), Salmonella spp. (6), Shigella spp. (2), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Acinetobacter spp. (4), Proteus spp. (7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (59), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), Candida spp. (10) and Aspergillus spp. (7). In vitro selection of resistance to Akacid plus was carried out on 24 strains. Toxicological analyses were also performed. RESULTS: All tested agents were more effective against Staphylococcus spp. and Bacillus spp. than against E. faecalis and Gram-negative bacteria. The MIC90s of chlorhexidine and mupirocin showed a 4-fold and 32-fold increase for methicillin-resistant S. aureus in comparison with methicillin-susceptible strains, while MIC values of Akacid plus were similar for antibiotic-susceptible and multiresistant strains. Bactericidal action of Akacid plus was observed at 1-2x MIC. The in vitro selection of resistance test showed no increase in MIC values of Akacid plus for any isolate after 30 passages. In addition, Akacid plus showed low oral and dermal toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results demonstrate the broad antimicrobial properties of Akacid plus, which makes it a promising tool for topical application in the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - [The effect of surface free energy parameters of diamond-like carbon films deposited on medical polyethylene terephthalate on bacterial adhesion].
AB  - Diamond-like carbon (DLC) films were deposited by acetylene plasma immersion ion  implantation-deposition (PIII-D) on biomedical polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The capacities of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Escherichia coli (EC), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and Candida albicans (CA) for adhesion to PETs are quantitatively determined by the plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125I radio labeled bacteria in vitro. The results indicate that the capacities of five types of bacteria for adhesion to PETs are all suppressed by C2H2 PIII-D (P<0.05). The surface energy components of the various substrates and bacteria are calculated based on measurements in water, formamide and diiodomethane and Lifshitz-van del Waals/acid-base approach (LW-AB). The surface free energies obtained are used to calculate the interfacial free energies of adhesion (deltaF(adh)) of five kinds of bacteria on various substrates, and the results show that it is energetically unfavorable for bacterial adhesion to the DLC films already deposited on PET by C2H2 PIII-D.
TI  - A glance at the role of exotoxins in opportunistic bacterial infections.
AB  - The production and the mechanism of action of exotoxins from Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are presented. The attack to the immune host's defenses is the main virulence factor of opportunistic bacteria in implant infections, favoring the invasion and colonization of compromised periprosthesis tissues.
TI  - [Synthesis and antibacterial activity of dl-7-(4,4-dimethyl-3-aminomethylpyrrolidinyl) -quinolones].
AB  - AIM: To explore new agents of quinolone derivatives with high activity against Gram-positive organisms. METHODS: dl-7-(4,4-Dimethyl-3- aminomethylpyrrolidinyl)-quinolones were designed and synthesized, and their activity against Gram-positive organisms was tested in vitro. RESULTS: Ten target compounds were obtained. The structures of these compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, MS. The target compounds with dl-4,4-dimethyl-3-( methyl) aminomethylpyrrolidine side chains had high activity against Gram-positive organisms. Especially the MIC values of compound 22 for 4 strains of Gram-positive resistant bacteria (two strains of MRSA and two of MRSE) were 0.015 -0.5 mg x L(-), which exhibited more potent activities than gatifloxacin (4 - 128 times). Its MIC value for Pseudomonas aeruginosa 03-5 (0.008 mg x L(-1)) was 4 times as that of gatifloxacin (0.03 mg x L(-1)). CONCLUSION: The compound 22 showed high activity against Gram-positive organisms in vitro and it is worth of more investigation.
TI  - [Infection pathogen analysis of 2388 patients in an open hematology ward from 1993 to 2004].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of infection and pathogens in hematology  ward. METHODS: The data of incidence, pathogen, and outcome of infection of 2388 hospitalized patients in an open hematology ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of infection was 34.3% according to the person-times of hospitalization, 24.4% for nosocomial infection and 9.9% for community-acquired infection. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infection were Gram negative. The most common bacteria in the sputum samples included Enterobacter (27%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus (MRSCoN, 12%), the most common bacteria in the blood samples included Escherichia coli (43%), Enterobacter cloacae (11%), and Klebsiella (11%). Whereas in the community-acquired infection the most common bacteria in the sputum samples were Haemophilus parainfluenzae (15%), MRSCoN (28%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (10%), and the most common bacteria in the blood samples were MRSCoN (28%), E. coli (28%), and Klebsiella (9.4%). Fungi were more often found in nosocomial infection, especially in the sputum samples. 12-year follow up showed that in nosocomial infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained the most common bacteria in the sputum samples, whereas E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae became the major bacteria in the blood samples. In community-acquired infection, the proportion of Staphylococcus aureus, that of Klebsiella in blood samples, and that of E. coli in throat swab samples increased in recent years. The incidence of fungi infection had increased in both nosocomial infection and community acquired infection. The mortality of nosocomial infection was 6.1%, higher than that of the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.17). There was a trend of decrease in the mortality of community-acquired infection but did not in the nosocomial infection. CONCLUSION: The patients in hematology ward are susceptible to infection, especially nosocomial infection that has a higher mortality rate in comparison with the community-acquired infection, however, not statistically significant. The pathogens of nosocomial infection are most likely G- bacteria, fungi and other bacteria resistant to most antibiotics. The mortality rate of nosocomial infection remains almost unchanged in the 12-year follow up.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ZnII, CdII, and HgII complexes of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols and 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with ZnCl2, CdCl2 and HgCl2 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. HgII complexes have a considerably higher antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms. Some HgII complexes show higher antifungal activity than clotrimazole toward C. albicans. Zn2(L3)Cl4, Zn2(L4)Cl4, and Cd(L3)Cl2 were moderately effective against S. aureus and S. epidermidis; Cd(L4)Cl2 exhibited a weak activity only against S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of 1,2-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2-ethanediols, 1,4-bis-[2-(5-R)-1H-benzimidazolyl]- 1,2,3,4-butanetetraols and their FeIII, CuII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 1,2-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl/NO2)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2-ethanediols (L1-L4), 1,4-Bis-[2-(5-H/Me/Cl)-1H-benzimidazolyl]-1,2,3,4-butanetetraols (L5-L7) and their complexes with FeCl3, CuCl2, and AgNO3 were synthesized; antibacterial activity of the compounds was determined toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis, and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some AgI complexes show higher activity toward S. epidermidis than AgNO3 and cefuroxime. Cu(L3)Cl2 and Fe(L3)Cl3 show an antifungal effect on C. albicans but L3 itself has no activity.
TI  - [Clinical observation of the effects of FE combined enzymes on the infection of the granulation burn wound during late post burns stage].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of combined FE enzymes on the infection of the  granulation burn wound during late postburn stage in controlling burn wound infection caused by common antibiotic resistant bacteria. METHODS: Thirty patients in our burn ward were enrolled and were randomly divided into A [treated with combined FE enzymes (50 ml dissolved in 0-150 ml normal saline to reach the final concentration of 1-3 U/ml)] and B (treated with gentamicin) groups, with 15 patients in each group. Several layers of gauze, either soaked with combined FE enzyme in A or gentamicin in B group, were used to cover the burn wounds once to twice a day. Bacterial culture from the burn wound exudation before and after drug administration was done before the application of the agents. The bacteria in the burn wounds and their susceptibility to antibiotics were identified. The healing time of the burn wounds was recorded. Furthermore, the healing rate of the burn wound was recorded on the 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th and 12th post skin grafting days (PSGD). RESULTS: The dominating bacteria in the burn wounds in both groups were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and MRSA. The susceptibility rate of bacteria ( MRSA, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyte, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) to combined FE enzyme was 93.8%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 95.0% respectively, which were much higher than those in B group (17.6%, 31.3%, 28.6%, 44.0%, 33.3%, 28.0% respectively, P < 0.1. The wound healing time after skin grafting in A group (10.6 +/- 1.5 days) was significantly shorter than that in B group (15.3 +/- 1.7 days, P < 0.01). The wound healing rate on 10 PSGD in A group was (85.4 +/- 2.4)%, and which was only (51.3 +/- 1.5% in B group (P < 0.01) CONCLUSION: Combined FE enzyme can effectively control burn wound infection, so that the interval between skin grafting and wound healing can be shortened and success rate of skin grafting be improved.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro efficacies of various catheter lock solutions.
AB  - MEDTA (minocycline-edetate calcium disodium), taurolidine (2%)-polyvinylpyrolidine (5%) (T/PVP), and ethanol as potential catheter lock solutions have a unique mechanism of action, broad-spectrum activity, and anticoagulant properties. Traditional lock solutions minocycline (M), rifampin (R), ciprofloxacin (C), and vancomycin, except pharmacologic concentrations of C and R and of M and R, were less effective than MEDTA and T/PVP.
TI  - Antibiofilm activity of GlmU enzyme inhibitors against catheter-associated uropathogens.
AB  - The colonization of uropathogenic bacteria on urinary catheters resulting in biofilm formation frequently leads to the infection of surrounding tissue and often requires removal of the catheter. Infections associated with biofilms are difficult to treat since they may be more than 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. We have developed an antibiofilm composition comprising an N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate acetyltransferase (GlmU) inhibitor and protamine sulfate, a cationic polypeptide. The antibiofilm activity of GlmU inhibitors, such as iodoacetamide (IDA), N-ethyl maleimide (NEM), and NEM analogs, including N-phenyl maleimide, N,N'-(1,2-phenylene)dimaleimide (oPDM), and N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide (PyrM), was tested against that of catheter-associated uropathogens. Both IDA and NEM inhibited biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. All NEM analogs showed antibiofilm activity against clinical isolates of E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis. The combination of oPDM with protamine sulfate (PS) enhanced its antibiofilm activity and reduced its effective concentration to as low as 12.5 microM. In addition, we found that the in vitro inhibitory activity of oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters against P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis colonization was superior to that of catheters coated with silver hydrogel. Confocal scanning laser microscopy further confirmed that the oPDM-plus-PS-coated silicone catheters were almost free from bacterial colonization. Thus, a broad-spectrum antibiofilm composition comprising a GlmU inhibitor and protamine sulfate shows promise for use in anti-infective coatings for medical devices, including urinary catheters.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activities of some medicinal plants from Cameroon.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of 10 plant species (Voacanga africana, Crepis cameroonica, Plagiostyles africana, Crotalaria retusa, Mammea africana, Lophira lanceolata, Ochna afzelii, Ouratea elongata, Ou. flava and Ou. sulcata), each of which is currently used in the traditional medicine of Cameroon, were investigated in vitro. The activities of a methanol extract of each plant were tested, in disc-diffusion assays, against 37 reference or laboratory strains of seven species of microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus hirae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of each extract were then estimated, against each of the more susceptible microorganisms (i.e. those giving an inhibition zone measuring at least 9 mm in diameter in the disc-diffusion assays), by agar dilution. Although, in the disc-diffusion assays, each of the 10 methanol extracts investigated displayed some degree of antimicrobial activity against at least one species of microorganism, no activity against the Gram-negative bacteria (Es. coli, K. pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa) was observed. The extract with the greatest antimicrobial activity was that of Pl. africana (Euphorbiaceae).
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial and anticonvulsant activities of some new 3-[2- (5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl/4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl) imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-ones and investigation of their structure-activity relationships.
AB  - In the present study, 20 new compounds having 3-[2-(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)  imino-4-thiazolidinon-5-ylidene]-5-substituted/nonsubstituted 1H-indole-2-one (I-XII) and 3-[2-(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino-4-thiazoldinon-5-ylidenel-5-substitute d/nonsubstituted IH-indole-2-one (XIII-XX) systems were synthesized. The structures were confirmed by spectral methods (UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C-DEPT (135), electron impact mass spectrometry) and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Microsporum gypseum (NCPF-580), Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Trichophyton rubrum and some of them were found to be active. Especially, compound I was more active than cefuroxime sodium (CAS 56238-63-2) which was used as a standard, and the activity of compound XII was close to that of cefuroxime sodium against Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. Primary screening for antituberculous activity was conducted at 6.25 microg/ml against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv in BACTEC 12B medium using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The anticonvulsant activities of selected prototoype compounds (I, IV-VI, VIII, XI, XIII, XVI-XVIII) administered at doses of 50-200 mg/kg (i.p.) were evaluated using the pentetrazol test (PTZ) in mice.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Ethanol disinfection of plastic-adherent micro-organisms.
AB  - This study investigated the bactericidal effect of ethanol/water (70:30 vol:vol)  against plastic-adherent organisms that commonly cause line infections. The experiments were performed in polycarbonate wells and all incubations were at 37 degrees C. Bacteria in broth were inoculated into wells and incubated (16, 40 and 72 h) before washing to remove non-adherent organisms and exposure to ethanol/water. Wells were then re-incubated with broth to detect surviving bacteria. All organisms incubated for 16 h were killed by 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol. After incubation for 40 h, 4h of exposure to ethanol was required to kill two strains of Candida albicans. Likewise, one of three of both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, incubated for 72 h, showed growth after 1h of exposure to 70% ethanol but not after 4h of exposure. These results suggest that in contrast to log phase organisms, which are killed by ethanol/water solutions in seconds, plastic-adherent organisms are more resistant to the bactericidal activity of ethanol.
TI  - Interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.
AB  - AIMS: The effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from Pseudomonasaeruginosa DS10-129 was studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: The ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. The results showed an effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. Maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for Streptococcus salivarius GB 24/9 and Candida tropicalis GB 9/9. The number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for Staphylococcus epidermidis GB 9/6, Strep. salivarius GB 24/9, Staphylococcus aureus GB 2/1 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9 in comparison to controls. Perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for Staph. aureus GB 2/1 (67%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization of silicone rubber voice prostheses.

TI  - Evaluation of a bi-layer wound dressing for burn care. II. In vitro and in vivo bactericidal properties.
AB  - We have recently designed a medicated bi-layer wound dressing to address the key  requirements for treating external, contaminated war wounds. This study assessed the in vitro and in vivo bactericidal efficacies of the DRDC hydrogel/polyurethane wound dressing. Chloramphenicol- and chlorhexidine-loaded DRDC dressings produced significantly larger zones of inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa than the other medicated dressings for 4 d. Chlorhexidine-loaded Allevyn and Hydrasorb remained bactericidal for 48 h only. Chloramphenicol-loaded Hydrasorb and Allevyn remained bactericidal for 1 and 3 d, respectively. Ps. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts in wounds treated with chlorhexidine- and chloramphenicol-loaded DRDC dressings for 24 h were 1-3-log lower than those of control wounds. While Ps. aeruginosa counts in the wounds on day 4 were comparable following daily changes of either antiseptic-loaded dressings, chlorhexidine showed a 75% greater bactericidal efficacy against Staph. epidermidis than chloramphenicol. Though increasing the frequency of dressing changes led to a greater reduction in the wound bacterial load, the contamination levels of all antiseptic-treated wounds remained below 10(5) CFU/g of wound. Cerium nitrate-loaded dressings did not exert any bactericidal effect, irrespective of the experimental conditions. These data show that the DRDC dressing is effective in delivering medications, such as an antimicrobial agent, to the wound bed.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity and QSAR studies of 1,2-disubstituted-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolines.
AB  - Some new substituted-tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard Gram positive and Gram negative strains: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), S. epidermidis (WHO-6), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), 1-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 4a-c proved to be effective with MIC 3.5-20 (microg ml(-1)). Quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies with multiple linear regression analysis were applied to find correlation between different calculated molecular descriptors of the synthesized compounds and biological activity.
TI  - Etiology of implant orthopedic infections: a survey on 1027 clinical isolates.
AB  - In spite of the recent achievements derived from modern protocols of prophylaxis, orthopedic surgical infections still remain unacceptably frequent, especially in light of the often devastating outcomes of septic complications. The spectrum and the prevalence of the bacteria most frequently involved in orthopedic infections are here explored, with particular reference to those infections associated to implant biomaterials, which were grouped based on device typology. During a 30 months period (from September 2000 to April 2003), 1027 microbial strains were consecutively isolated from 699 patients undergoing revision surgery at the Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute. 775 (75.5%) of all these microorganisms were identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus genus, 82 (8%) to the Enterobacteriaceae family, 75 (7.3%) to the Pseudomonas genus, 54 (5.3%) to the Enterococcus genus and 20 (1.9%) to the Streptococcus genus. While confirming the importance of staphylococci as the most diffuse cause of infection, our data indicate an unexpectedly high prevalence of S. epidermidis on infected hip and knee arthroprostheses, respectively of 42% and 44%. The spectrum of bacteria infecting either internal or external fracture fixation devices appears to differ from that of hip and knee arthroprostheses and more closely resembles that of infections non-associated to medical devices, being characterized by a relatively higher prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (over 40%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Enterobacteriaceae and members of the Streptococcus and Corynebacterium genera are frequently associated with implants in which surgical incisions were made near the perineum, determining a completely altered spectrum.
TI  - [Evaluation of the antimicrobial action of honey against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Listeria monocytogenes and Aspergillus niger. Evaluation of its microbiological charge].
AB  - The evaluation of the microbiological charge present in Costa Rican samples as the evaluation of its antimicrobial activity over different microorganisms, including those associated to wound infections, will allow to emit criteria referred to its use in therapeutic treatments, specially as alternative therapy for cases involving antibiotic resistant bacteria. The microbiological charge of 25 honey samples, acquired in Costa Rican markets was evaluated through several indicators including total plate aerobic count, total plate anaerobic count, total aerobic spore count, total anaerobic spore count and molds and yeast count. Also, samples were inoculated in tubes with chopped meat media and plated in egg yolk agar in order to determine the presence of Clostridium botulinum. For the antimicrobial activity evaluation, the diffusion method in Muller Hinton agar was performed, testing different honey concentrations (100, 75, 50, 25, 12,5 and 6,25 % v/v) against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (UCR 2902), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19116) and Aspergillus niger. The results obtained for the microbiological characterization of honey show that 91% of samples had counts equal or lower than 1,0 x 10(1) CFU/g. No positive result was obtained for the isolation of C. botulinum. 24 of the samples analyzed inhibited the growth of S. aureus even in a 25% v/v concentration, nevertheless, A. niger was no inhibited by any of the samples tested.
TI  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  - Cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (CIS). When chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. Testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of CIS using various microbes such as Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus salivarius, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces ludwigii, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. In particular, recovery was improved when L-cysteine was added. A mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto CIS could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. Most of the desorbed cells were alive. Thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of N-alkyl and N-aryl piperazine derivatives.
AB  - A series of substituted piperazine derivatives have been synthesized and tested for antimicrobial activity. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (MTCCB 737), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCCB 741), Streptomyces epidermidis (MTCCB 1824) and Escherichia coli (MTCCB 1652), and antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. All synthesized compounds showed significant activity against bacterial strains but were found to be less active against tested fungi. In vitro toxicity tests demonstrated that compounds 4d and 6a showed very less toxicity against human erythrocytes.
TI  - Optimal sampling time after preparation of platelet concentrates for detection of bacterial contamination by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A universal quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on bacterial 16S rDNA, to detect bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs), was developed previously and compared with automated culturing. In the present study, this real-time PCR method was evaluated to determine the optimal sampling time for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routinely prepared PCs were spiked with suspensions of Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Propionibacterium acnes to 1, 10 and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml and stored at room temperature for 7 days. The presence of bacteria in these PCs was monitored by quantitative real-time PCR. As a reference method (additional control), BacT/Alert automated culturing was used. For PCR, 1-ml aliquots were drawn from all (spiked) PCs on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of storage. As a control, triplicate samples (10 ml) were inoculated into aerobic and anaerobic BacT/Alert culture bottles immediately after spiking (day 0) and after storage for 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 days. RESULTS: With quantitative real-time PCR, all bacterial species tested were reproducibly detected on day 1 after spiking at original concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml. Bacteria were also detected on day 1 from PCs spiked with an initial concentration of 1 CFU/ml, except for E. coli, which was detected in only one of the three samples and P. aeruginosa, for which analysis was not performed on day 1. With the reference method, bacteria were detected in culture bottles (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 20.1 h, with the exception of P. acnes which was detected at a mean time of 102.3 and 49.3 h (for original spiking concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU/ml respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PCR enables the rapid detection of low initial numbers of bacteria in PCs. For reliable detection, our results support that sampling of PCs for real-time PCR screening should not be carried out earlier than 1 day after preparation (48 h after blood collection). Importantly, the real-time PCR approach has the potential to be used before the release of PCs from the blood centre or shortly before they are transfused in the hospital.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Bacterial and fungal absorption properties of a hydrogel dressing with a superabsorbent polymer core.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study in vitro the micro-organism absorption properties of a hydrogel wound dressing, TenderWet. METHOD: Microbial films on agar plates and suspensions with common wound bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and a fungal strain (Candida albicans) were studied. RESULTS: The hydrogel dressing reduced the number of micro-organisms significantly, both on the agar plate and in suspension. The in vitro data show that the hydrogel dressing absorbed the micro-organisms from the environment. Electron microscopic imaging clearly demonstrated that the germs were attached to the surface of the dressing's superabsorbent polymer core. CONCLUSION: In vitro data show that the hydrogel dressing TenderWet attracts and retains micro-organisms and reduces the number of viable germs. Clinical experience underlines this fast cleansing and debriding effect of the hydrogel wound dressing.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Increase of faecal bifidobacteria due to dietary oligosaccharides induces a reduction of clinically relevant pathogen germs in the faeces of formula-fed preterm infants.
AB  - In a previous study on formula-fed preterm infants, we were able to demonstrate that dietary oligosaccharides (a mixture of 90% galacto-oligosaccharides and 10% fructo-oligosaccharides in a concentration of 1 g/dl) stimulate the growth of faecal bifidobacteria. In the present explorative analysis of this study, we focus on the effect of the dominance of bifidobacteria on the presence of clinically relevant pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Streptococcus group B, Clostridium difficile, Bacillus subtilis and Acinetobacter). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that stimulation of bifidobacteria by prebiotic oligosaccharides reduces the presence of clinically relevant pathogens in the faecal flora, indicating that prebiotic substances might have the capacity to protect against enteral infections.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - [Biofilms].
AB  
TI  - Central venous catheters and infections.
AB  - The indications to the positioning of central venous catheters (CVCs) are various: parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, infusion of large amount of fluids or blood products, chronic access for hemodialysis, invasive measurement of hemodynamic variables. Infection is the most important clinical complication associated with the use of CVC, both in terms of incidence and of gravity. Despite the efforts for the optimization of the materials that are more and more biocompatible, the presence of a foreign body in the organism is an ideal substratum for the microbial colonization. The Catheter-Related-Bloodstream-Infections (CRBI) involve a pro-longation of recovery stay, the increase in costs of hospitalization and an increase in morbidity and mortality. The infections are caused by: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (60%), other bacteria (Enterococ-cus faecalis and Faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 25%) and among fungi by Candida albicans and Parapsilosis (15%). In order to prevent the CRBI it's important to follow some behavioural norms, both during the positioning of the catheter and in the subsequent assistance to the patient. In case of CRBI it is fundamental to make a sure diagnosis with the positivity for the same pathogen of 2 hemocultures obtained from CVC and from a peripheral vein and then with the microbiological analysis of the tip of the catheter, in order to carry out the specific antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Pathogens and drug resistance of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial resistance and bacterial distribution of nosocomial pneumonia in neurosurgical patients. METHODS: We analyzed and counted the result of sputum culture, drug sensibilities test, and the rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery of all the patients in the Department of in Neurosurgery our hospital in 2002. RESULTS: The rate of nosocomial pneumonia after intracranial surgery was 6.2%. The first 5 strains were pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter, enterobacteriaceae, klebsiella, and staphylococcus epidermidis. Statistics of drug sensibility test suggested:the rate of ampicillin and cefuroxime resistance was over 83%. Gram-negative bacterium was the first sensitive to sulperazon and imipenem. Gram-positive bacterium was the first sensitive to vancomycin, ampicillin/sulbactam and rifampicin. CONCLUSION: The rate of neurosurgical infection was high. The most common pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. Drug resistance was serious.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some novel derivatives of benzofuran: part 1. Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl) ketoxime derivatives.
AB  - The reaction of salicylaldehyde with 1-phenyl-1-methyl-3-(2-chloro-1-oxoethyl) cyclobutane (1) and potassium carbonate was used to prepare (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-methyl-3-phenylcyclobutyl) methanone (2) for the starting reagent purposes. (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) was synthesized from the reaction of the compound (2) with hidroxylamine. New derivatives of (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl) ketoxime (3) such as, O-glycidylketoxime (4) and O-phenylacylketoxime (5a-c) were obtained very high yields. Alkyl, allyl and aryl substituted N-oxime ethers (6a-e) were obtained from the reaction compound 3 and various halogen contained compounds. The syntheses of the compounds (7a-f) were carried out from the reaction of the compound (4) and different amines such as, isopropyl amine, natrium azide, morpholine and piperazine. All of the synthesized compounds were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Among the synthesized compounds (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methyl cyclobutyl)-O-[2-hydroxy-3-(N-methylpiperazino)] propylketoxime (7d) was found the most active derivative against S. aureus ATCC 6538. The compounds 2, 5b, 6b, 6c, 7b and 7f showed very strong and the same antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. Similarly (benzofuran-2-yl)(3-phenyl-3-methylcyclobutyl)-O-benzylketoxime 6a showed good antimicrobial effect against C. albicans ATCC 10231. None of the other compounds exhibited activity against the other test microorganisms.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of MSI-78 alone and in combination with antibiotics against bacteria responsible for bloodstream infections in neutropenic patients.
AB  - MSI-78 is a 22 amino acid amphipathic peptide with potent antimicrobial activity  against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, including antibiotic-resistant strains. In this study, we assessed the in vitro activity of MSI-78 alone and in combination with eight clinically used antimicrobial agents against several strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli isolated from blood of neutropenic febrile patients. Antimicrobial activity of MSI-78 was measured by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), time-kill studies and checkerboard titration method. The Gram-negative isolates were susceptible to the peptide at concentrations in the range 0.50-16 mg/L, while staphylococci showed lower susceptibility. MSI-78 demonstrated a higher antimicrobial activity than colistin against Gram-negative organisms. The checkerboard titration method demonstrated synergy when the peptide was combined with beta-lactams. These results provide evidence for the potential use of MSI-78 in the management of severe infections in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Evaluation of pooled cultures for bacterial detection in whole blood-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) system is highly efficient for bacterial  detection in apheresis platelets (PLTs) and whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the buffy-coat method. Detection of bacterial contamination in whole blood-derived PLTs produced by the PLT-rich plasma (PRP) method, however, is problematic. Prestorage pooling of these PLTs is not permitted in some countries including Canada and the United States, and culturing individual units is costly and may significantly reduce the PLT unit content. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of BacT/ALERT cultures performed on pools derived from PRP PLTs are reported. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of the BacT/ALERT system was evaluated for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs with a dilution effect. Thirty PLT pools were produced with 1 PLT unit previously spiked with bacteria and then pooled with other four nonspiked PLT units. Three bacteria, usually associated with PLT contamination, were selected for spiking. The specificity of this method was evaluated in 40 nonspiked PLT pools. RESULTS: The method was found to be 100 percent specific and 97 percent sensitive. Of the five spiked pools with Streptococcus pneumoniae at levels of less than 2 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL, four were found to be positive whereas all 25 spiked pools with greater than 9 CFUs per mL of any of the chosen bacteria gave positive results. The mean time of detection was 17 to 19 hours for Staphylococcus epidermidis and 14 to 15 hours for S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when spiked with similar bacterial inocula. CONCLUSION: The evaluated system is highly sensitive and specific and may be a feasible method for bacterial detection in PRP PLTs.
TI  - Septic, CD-30 positive febrile ulceronecrotic pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
AB  - We report life-threatening febrile ulceronecrotic pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta in an 8-year-old girl. Hemorrhagic-crusted papules and plaques covered over 90% of the patient's body, leaving her susceptible to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia as well as Candida parapsilosis fungemia. Sepsis delayed definitive treatment of the underlying cutaneous disease for 2 weeks. Combined therapy with methotrexate and cyclosporin caused remission of the process. Although immunohistochemistry revealed CD-30 positive cells, suggesting the diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis, the histopathology was most compatible with pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta. A partial loss of CD2 and CD5 in the predominant CD3 T-cell lymphocytes suggested a clonal proliferation. Elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels reflected marked T-cell activation, and the downward trend of the levels during treatment coincided with clinical regression of this inflammatory dermatosis.
TI  - Molecular and imaging techniques for bacterial biofilms in joint arthroplasty infections.
AB  - Biofilm formation on surfaces is an ancient and integral strategy for bacterial survival. Billions of years of adaptation provide microbes with the ability to colonize any surface, including those used in orthopaedic surgery. Although remarkable progress has been made in the treatment of orthopaedic diseases with implanted prostheses, infection rates remain between 1% and 2%, and are higher for revision surgeries. The chronic nature of implant infections, their nonresponsiveness to antibiotics, and their frequent culture negativity can be explained by the biofilm paradigm of infectious disease. However, the role of biofilms in orthopaedic implant infections and aseptic loosening is controversial. To address these issues, we developed molecular diagnostic and confocal imaging techniques to identify and characterize biofilms associated with infected implants. We designed PCR and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-based assays that can be used to detect bacterial infections associated with culture-negative joint effusions that distinguish between physiologically active Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we constructed a series of reporter strains expressing colored fluorescent proteins to observe biofilms growing on 316L stainless steel and titanium orthopaedic screws. Three-dimensional structures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococci biofilms growing on the screws were documented using confocal microscopy. The application of these tools for clinical diagnosis and biofilm research in animal and in vitro models is discussed.
TI  - [Identification of bacterial flora of conjunctival sac in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children].
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the species of the microorganisms and their susceptibility to antibiotics in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The pus secretion after lacrimal sac massage was obtained from 81 children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. The laboratory diagnostics was performed using typical microbiological procedures. The modification of these procedures was 24-hour pre-incubation in sugar boullion. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28%) and Staphylococcus aureus (22%). The isolated staphylococci (only coagulase-negative species MRSE) were resistant to methicillin in 2 cases. Streptococci were obtained in 20% isolations: Streptococcus pneumoniae (14%), Streptococcus viridans (6%). Gram-negative bacilli Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Moraxella spp. and Candida albicans were isolated in a few cases. Negative results of the cultures were obtained in 25% cases. CONCLUSIONS: The microorganisms typically constituting physiological flora of conjunctival sac may become the pathogens in the complications of congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-023 (RO4908463), a novel parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - CS-023 (RO4908463, formerly R-115685) is a novel 1beta-methylcarbapenem with 5-substituted pyrrolidin-3-ylthio groups, including an amidine moiety at the C-2 position. Its antibacterial activity was tested against 1,214 clinical isolates of 32 species and was compared with those of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin, amikacin, and levofloxacin. CS-023 exhibited a broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive and -negative aerobes and anaerobes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CS-023 showed the most potent activity among the compounds tested against P. aeruginosa and MRSA, with MICs at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited of 4 microg/ml and 8 microg/ml, respectively. CS-023 was stable against hydrolysis by the beta-lactamases from Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris. CS-023 also showed potent activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. The in vivo efficacy of CS-023 was evaluated with a murine systemic infection model induced by 13 strains of gram-positive and -negative pathogens and a lung infection model induced by 2 strains of PRSP (serotypes 6 and 19). Against the systemic infections with PRSP, MRSA, and P. aeruginosa and the lung infections, the efficacy of CS-023 was comparable to those of imipenem/cilastatin and vancomycin (tested against lung infections only) and superior to those of meropenem, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime (tested against P. aeruginosa infections only). These results suggest that CS-023 has potential for the treatment of nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including MRSA and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Human cathelicidin (LL-37), a multifunctional peptide, is expressed by ocular surface epithelia and has potent antibacterial and antiviral activity.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study determined whether LL-37 (cathelicidin) is expressed by conjunctival and corneal epithelia as part of ocular host defense. The antimicrobial activity of LL-37 was also assessed in vitro against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), and adenovirus (Ad). METHODS: Expression of LL-37/hCAP 18 mRNA and LL-37 protein was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting, respectively, in scraped human corneal epithelium and primary cultured human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. The EC50 values for three strains of PA and one each of SA and SE were determined for LL-37. LL-37 antiviral inhibition of HSV-1 and adenovirus was assessed by direct inactivation assays. Toxicity of LL-37 to A549 cells was evaluated by a MTT assay. RESULTS: LL-37/hCAP18 mRNA and LL-37 peptide were expressed by human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. Antibacterial activity for LL-37 was demonstrated (EC50 values for the three PA strains were 2.8 +/- 1.3, 1.9 +/- 0.3, and 3.6 +/- 2.1; for SA: 1.6 +/- 1.5; for SE: 1.3 +/- 1.9 microg/ml). LL-37 produced a significant reduction (p < 0.001 ANOVA) in HSV-1 and Ad19 viral titers with distinctly different time-kill curves (p < 0.001). LL-37 (up to 111 microM) produced no toxicity in A549 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal and conjunctival epithelia express LL-37 as part of mucosal innate immunity to protect against bacterial and viral ocular infections.
TI  - Tetrasodium EDTA as a novel central venous catheter lock solution against biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central venous catheter (CVC)-related bloodstream infections (BSIs) are known to increase rates of morbidity and mortality in both inpatients and outpatients, including hematology-oncology patients and those undergoing hemodialysis or home infusion therapy. Biofilm-associated organisms on the lumens of these catheters have reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial chemotherapy. This study tested the efficacy of tetrasodium EDTA as a catheter lock solution on biofilms of several clinically relevant microorganisms. METHODS: Biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans were grown to levels of approximately 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units (CFU)/cm(-1) on CVC segments in a model system, then subjected to the tetrasodium EDTA lock treatment. RESULTS: Comparisons of biofilms before and after exposure to the 40-mg/mL(-1) tetrasodium EDTA lock for 21 hours showed that the biofilm viable cell counts of all organisms tested were significantly reduced (P < .05) after exposure to the treatment. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial lock treatment using 40 mg/mL(-1) of tetrasodium EDTA for at least 21 hours could significantly reduce or potentially eradicate CVC-associated biofilms of clinically relevant microorganisms.
TI  - The fixed combination of fortified vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solution--VA solution: in vitro study of the potency and stability.
AB  - PURPOSE: We compared the in vitro potency and stability of a fixed combination of vancomycin and amikacin solution (VA solution) with amikacin or vancomycin solution. METHODS: Solutions of 2% amikacin (20 mg/mL) and of 5% vancomycin (50 mg/mL) and VA solution (each 1 mL contained 20 mg of amikacin and 50 mg of vancomycin) were prepared from parenteral antibiotics by reconstituting them with sterile injection water and refrigerated (4 degrees C) in the dark. Triplicate 5-mL portions of each solution were tested before storage and 7 and 14 days after preparation for potency of antimicrobial activity by the disk diffusion method and for stability. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the diameter of zones of inhibition of VA solution compared with amikacin or vancomycin solution within a 2-week period. Visual inspection revealed that all solutions remained clear, colorless, and particle-free at 4 degrees C throughout the study period. For osmolarity, the VA solution was much higher than that of either amikacin or vancomycin solution at all tested times and more near the well-tolerated range of human eyes. There were no significant differences at days 0, 7, or 14 for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution. For pH, the VA solution was higher than that of vancomycin solution (nearly equal to that of amikacin solution) at each time and more near the level of normal tear film. The pH did not differ significantly for either vancomycin, amikacin, or VA solution at all tested times. CONCLUSIONS: The vancomycin and amikacin ophthalmic solutions can be mixed together with the same potency and stable physical properties. It may be useful in the treatment of bacterial keratitis pending clinical trials to determine its effectiveness and safety.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate, Portland cement and EndoRez.
AB  - AIM: To determine in vitro the antimicrobial activity of Fill Canal, Sealapex, Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA), Portland cement and EndoRez on various species of microorganisms. METHODOLOGY: The diffusion method on Muller-Hinton agar (MH) was employed. A base layer was made using MH agar and five wells were made by removing agar at equidistant points. Sealers were placed into the wells immediately after manipulation. The microorganisms Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were seeded by pour plate. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Aliquots of 10 mL of 0.05% triphenyltetrazolium chloride gel were added for optimization and the zones of inhibition were measured. RESULTS: Sealapex and Fill Canal demonstrated antimicrobial activity for all strains. For MTA and Portland cement, only E. coli was not inhibited. No antimicrobial activity was detected for EndoRez. CONCLUSIONS: In this laboratory study, Fill Canal, Sealapex, MTA and Portland cement presented antimicrobial activity whilst EndoRez did not.
TI  - [Endophthalmitis after phacoemucification surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infective endophthalmitis after phacoemulsification and to discuss the methods for prevention and treatment of this complication. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on phacoemulsification with implantation of artificial lens underwent in 10 MaiGe Ophthalmological Centers during past 10 years (from 1993 to 2003). RESULTS: Among 63,372 cases (84,497 eyes) underwent the phacoemulsification, 14 cases suffered infective endophthalmitis with the incidence of 0.02%. In these 14 cases, 11 cases occurred before 1999 (78.6%). There were 5 cases of ruptured posterior lens capsule in these 14 cases (35.7%). Microbiological examination was performed in 11 cases (aqueous or vitreous sample), 7 cases showed positive results (63.6%), including 3 cases of staphylococcus epidermidis (42.8%), 1 case of pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%), 1 case of bacilli (16.7%) and 2 cases (33.4%) of fungus (yeast and candida albicans). After the treatment, the vision of 5 patients was recovered to 2.0 or more, 4 cases recovered to hand movement and light perception, enucleation was performed in 3 cases and atrophy of eyeballs occurred in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The attack rate of endophthalmitis after phacoemucification surgery is 0.02%. The main pathogen is staphylococcus epidermidis. Rupture of posterior lens capsule is one of the main risk factors of endophthalmitis. Observing the operative routine strictly pre-, during and post-operatively can reduce the occurrence of infective endophthalmitis.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis to silicone-hydrogel contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to compare the adhesion capabilities of the most important etiologic agents of microbial ocular infection to the recently available silicone-hydrogel lenses with those to a conventional hydrogel lens. METHODS: In vitro static adhesion assays of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10,145, Staphylococcus epidermidis 9142 (biofilm-positive), and 12,228 (biofilm-negative) to two extended-wear silicone-hydrogel lenses (balafilcon A and lotrafilcon A), a daily wear silicone-hydrogel lens (galyfilcon A) and a conventional hydrogel (etafilcon A) were performed. To interpret the adhesion results, lens surface relative hydrophobicity was assessed by water contact angle measurements. RESULTS: P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis 9142 exhibited greater adhesion capabilities to the extended wear silicone-hydrogel lenses than to the daily wear silicone- and conventional hydrogel lenses (p < 0.05). No statistical differences were found between the adhesion extent of these strains to galyfilcon A and etafilcon A. The biofilm negative strain of S. epidermidis adhered in larger extents to the silicone-hydrogel lenses than to the conventional hydrogel (p < 0.05), but in much lower amounts than the biofilm-positive strain. The water contact angle measurements revealed that the extended wear silicone-hydrogel lenses are hydrophobic, whereas the daily wear silicone- and conventional hydrogel lenses are hydrophilic. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of their hydrophobicity, the extended wear silicone-hydrogel lenses (lotrafilcon A and balafilcon A) may carry higher risk of microbial contamination than both the hydrophilic daily wear silicone-hydrogel lens, galyfilcon A and the conventional hydrogel lens, etafilcon A.
TI  - [An investigation of bacterial ecology and analysis of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in a burn ward in Nanning district].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the bacterial ecology and to analyze the bacterial resistance to antibiotics in a burn ward in Nanning district during the past 15 years, so as to provide reference to the clinical management of burn infection under subtropical climate. METHODS: Five thousand eight hundred and fifty-five strains of bacteria were isolated from the wounds and blood of 2269 burn patients admitted to our hospital from April of 1989 to March of 2004. Kiry-Bauer method was employed for the detection of antibiotic sensitivity test. The bacterial examination and bacterial resistance were analyzed in spans of every five years. RESULTS: Burn patients in our district were mainly infected by the gram negative bacilli (3559 strains, accounting for 60.79%), among which Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Nitrate negative bacilli were major ones in every period. Gram positive cocci accounted for 33.99% (1990 strains), which ranked the second, among which Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Coagulase negative staphylococci (MRCNS) were the most predominant ones. The bacterial resistance to multiple antibiotics, such as Gentamicin, third generation of Cephalosporin, and Norfloxacin showed a tendency of increase or maintained at high level while the incidence of resistance to Imipenem and Vancomycin was very low. CONCLUSION: The climate and the way of using antibiotics exerted direct effects on the status of the bacterial ecology and change in bacterial resistance to various antibiotics.
TI  - Bloodstream infection after umbilical cord blood transplantation using reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation for adult patients.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant problem after cord blood transplantation (CBT). However, little information has been reported on BSI after reduced-intensity CBT (RI-CBT). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 102 patients. The median age of the patients was 55 years (range, 17-79 years). Preparative regimens comprised fludarabine 125 to 150 mg/m 2 , melphalan 80 to 140 mg/m 2 , or busulfan 8 mg/kg and total body irradiation 2 to 8 Gy. Prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease comprised cyclosporin or tacrolimus. BSI developed within 100 days of RI-CBT in 32 patients. The cumulative incidence of BSI was 25% at day 30 and 32% at day 100. The median onset was day 15 (range, 1-98 days). Causative organisms included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 12), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 11), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6), Enterococcus faecium (n = 4), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 4), and others (n = 7). Of the 32 patients with BSI, 25 (84%) died within 100 days after RI-CBT. BSI was the direct cause of death in 8 patients (25%). Univariate analysis failed to identify any significant risk factors. BSI clearly represents a significant and fatal complication after RI-CBT. Further studies are warranted to determine clinical characteristics, identify patients at high risk of BSI, and establish therapeutic strategies.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of four different Anatolian propolis samples.
AB  - Propolis means a gum that is gathered by bees from various plants. It is known for its biological properties, having antibacterial, antifungal and healing properties. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of four different Anatolian propolis samples on different groups of microorganisms including some oral pathogens and comparison between their chemical compositions. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from four different Anatolian propolis samples and examined whether EEP inhibit the growth of the test microorganisms or not. For the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by using macrodilution method. The MIC values of the most effective propolis (TB) were 2 microg/ml for Streptococcus sobrinus and Enterococcus faecalis, 4 microg/ml for Micrococcus luteus, Candida albicans and C. krusei, 8 microg/ml for Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter aerogenes, 16 microg/ml for Escherichia coli and C. tropicalis and 32 microg/ml for Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chemical compositions of EEP's were determined by high-temperature high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The main compounds of four Anatolian propolis samples were flavonoids such as pinocembrin, pinostropin, isalpinin, pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine and chrysin. Although propolis samples were collected from different regions of Anatolia all showed significant antimicrobial activity against the Gram positive bacteria and yeasts. Propolis can prevent dental caries since it demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms such as Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus and C. albicans, which involves in oral diseases.
TI  - Stimulation of fracture healing by continuous delivery of demineralized bone matrix proteins and tobramycin.
AB  - Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is an allogenous, bioabsorbable material that has long been used for its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. A significant complication experienced by physicians who perform bone defect filling surgery is the risk of subsequent bacterial infections and the inefficiency of oral antibiotics to provide adequate prophylaxis against microorganisms, especially Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In order to deliver both DBM and an efficient antiobiotic at high local concentrations without deleterious systemic effects, a ceramic sustained delivery system was implanted and monitored over the course of 30 days for bone regeneration, infection, and systemic effects. Twenty-five adult Sprague Dawley albino male rats were used in the experiment. They were randomly divided into five equal groups. Animals in group 1 were used as control, group 2 animals had a created 5mm defect, in group 3 defect induced and implanted with devices loaded with antibiotic (tobramycin) alone, group 4 had a created defect plus DBM, and group 5 had a created defect, plus tobramycin (which is effective against the aforementioned organisms) and DBM. At 30 days post-implantation, the experimental animals showed no significant difference in weight when compared to the control and sham animals. X-rays taken at this time showed the experimental femurs to be totally healed and virtually indistinguishable from control. Initial dissections revealed that the implants were accepted by the hosts as shown by the fibrous, vascularized sheath that surrounded the femurs and capsules. The implants were found to be in close contact with the cancellous bone and none of the sheaths showed signs of infection. Macroscopically, no defect could be detected in the experimental animals, while little regeneration was observed in the femurs of the sham animals.
TI  - A new heptasubstituted (E)-aurone glucoside and other aromatic compounds of Gomphrena agrestis with biological activity.
AB  - A new aurone 1 and two known substances, aurantiamide acetate (2) and tiliroside  (3), were isolated from the ethanolic extract of Gomphrena agrestis. The structural determination of 1 was based on spectroscopic and spectrometric data. The substance was defined as (E)-3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4,5,6,4'-tetrahydroxy-7,2'-dimethoxyaurone. Biological activity of the ethanolic crude extract and isolated compounds against bacteria, fungi and Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes was evaluated. This appears to be the first report documenting aurone and aurantiamide compounds in the Amaranthaceae family. In the evaluation of biological activity the ethanolic extract of G. agrestis and compounds 1, 2, and 3 were shown to be active mainly against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Effects of quorum sensing molecules of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on organism growth, elastase B production, and primary adhesion to hydrogel contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: Extracellular proteinase production and biofilm structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are affected by acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) termed quorum sensing (QS) factors. C12- and C4-AHLs of P. aeruginosa and a synthetic furanone signaling antagonist were evaluated for effects on growth, primary adhesion to hydrogel contact lenses, and elastase B production of P. aeruginosa strains, including QS mutants, and isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. METHODS: Acylated homoserine lactones and furanone were added to cultures of bacteria at various growth stages. Primary adhesion of P. aeruginosa to lenses soaked in AHLs and furanone was examined by adenosine triphosphate analysis. Elastase B activity of cultures exposed to AHLs and furanone was determined by an elastin congo red assay. RESULTS: Acylated homoserine lactones had no significant effects on maximal cell densities or primary adhesion. Adhesion of a lasI-rhlI- QS mutant to lenses was significantly lower than its wild-type (WT) strain, regardless of added AHL or furanone. Exogenous AHLs had negligible effects on elastase production of WT P. aeruginosa but restored elastase production in QS-deficient mutants. The furanone was biocidal for staphylococci but enhanced growth of the lasI-rhlI- QS mutant. The furanone decreased elastase production of WT strains but increased QS mutant elastase production. CONCLUSIONS: Exogenous AHLs and the furanone were of minor importance in initial adhesion of P. aeruginosa to lenses. The furanone decreased staphylococci growth and elastase production of WT P. aeruginosa but increased growth and elastase production of QS mutants. The data further indicate strain diversity in P. aeruginosa and complexity of AHL systems.
TI  - Analysis of etiology and drug resistance of biliary infections.
AB  - The bile was collected from fro patients with biliary infections, with the bacterium isolated to study the sensitivity of each kind of the bacterium to several antibiotics in common use. Except G- bacterium, we also found some kinds of G+ bacterium in infection bile. G- bacterium were not sensitive to Clindamycin, G+ bacterium were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. Escherichia coli, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to Ampicillin. G+ bacterium were not sensitive to Azactam. Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobacter cloacae were not sensitive to Ceftazidime. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not sensitive to Ceftriaxone Sodium. We didn't found any bacterium resistance Imipenem. The possibility of the existence of G+ bacterium as well as drug resistance should be considered n patients with biliary infections. The value of susceptibility test should be respected to avoid drug abuse of antibiotics.
TI  - Accuracy of blood culture for early diagnosis of mediastinitis in febrile patients after cardiac surgery.
AB  - Postsurgical mediastinitis (PSM) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures. Although prompt diagnosis is crucial in these patients, neither clinical data nor imaging techniques have shown enough sensitivity or specificity for early diagnosis of PSM. The aim of the present study was to assess the validity of blood cultures as a diagnostic test for the early detection of PSM in patients who become febrile after cardiac surgery procedures. During a 4-year period (1999-2002), patients who developed fever (>37.8 degrees C) in the first 60 days after a cardiac surgery procedure were evaluated. Blood cultures were drawn from these patients. PSM was defined as deep infection involving retrosternal tissue and/or the sternal bone directly observed by the surgeon and confirmed microbiologically. Three criteria for positivity of blood cultures were applied: bacteremia, staphylococcal bacteremia, or Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. For purposes of the analysis, a positive blood culture in patients with PSM was considered a true-positive test and a negative blood culture a false-negative test. Otherwise, in febrile patients without PSM in the postsurgery period, a positive blood culture was considered a false-positive test and a negative blood culture a true-negative test. Blood cultures were drawn from 266 febrile patients in the postsurgery period. PSM occurred in 38 patients (26 cases due to S. aureus, 8 to Staphylococcus epidermidis, 3 to gram-negative enteric bacteria, and one to Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Within the 60-day postsurgical period, blood culture as a diagnostic test was most accurate in patients with S. aureus bacteremia, providing 68% sensitivity, 98% specificity, a positive predictive value of 87%, and a negative predictive value of 95%. If the analysis was limited to the period during which patients are at maximum risk for PSM (day 7-20), the values in patients with S. aureus bacteremia were as follows: 73% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 90% positive predictive value, and 93% negative predictive value. Blood culture is an accurate test for the early diagnosis of PSM in febrile patients after cardiac surgery, particularly in institutions where S. aureus is prevalent in this context. A negative blood culture practically excludes PSM and, during the period of maximum risk for PSM, the presence of S. aureus bacteremia should compel early surgical management.
TI  - Chlorine covers on living bacteria: the initial step in antimicrobial action of active chlorine compounds.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although active chlorine compounds are well-known antimicrobial agents in human medicine, their initial steps of action have not been completely clarified. Using N-chlorotaurine (NCT), an endogenous mild representative, we observed persisting oxidation capacity affixed to bacteria. It was the aim of this study to investigate this 'chlorine cover'. METHODS: Pathogens were incubated in NCT, which was subsequently washed off. The oxidation capacity on the bacterial surface was measured photometrically. RESULTS: Superficial chlorination in the form of covalent N-Cl bonds to Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans could be attached before killing took place. For S. aureus, 3 min incubation with NCT produced a cover of 3.3 x 10(-16) mol Cl(+)/cfu, while the cfu count was reduced by only 26%. The kind of microorganism, coating time, pH, buffer system and, basically, the chlorine compound, influenced the cover strength. The relative cover strength on S. aureus by NCT, chloramine T, sodium dichloro-isocyanurate or N,N-dichlorotaurine was 1:15.7:38.7:0.24. Chlorine covers were surprisingly stable and could be detected for 3 h at 20 degrees C (>8 h at 1 degrees C), even without a reduction of cfu. However, addition of 5% ammonium chloride caused a rapid loss of viability, explained by formation of highly bactericidal NH(2)Cl, an effect that resembles the ignition of a time-bomb. CONCLUSIONS: The chlorine cover can be regarded as the first sign of interaction between chlorinating agent and microorganism, and may explain the non-lethal features of postantibiotic effect and attenuation of bacterial virulence. Furthermore, it may be a decisive step in bacterial inactivation by the myeloperoxidase-hypochlorite system in innate immunity.
TI  - Identification of microbial mixtures by capillary electrophoresis/selective tandem mass spectrometry.
AB  - In this paper, we propose a new strategy for identifying specific bacteria in bacterial mixtures by using CE-selective MS/MS of peptide marker ions associated with the bacteria of interest. We searched the CE-MS/MS spectra acquired from the proteolytic digests of pure bacterial cell extracts against protein databases. The identified peptides that match the protein associated with the corresponding species were selected as marker ions for bacterial identification. Specific peptide marker ions were obtained for each of the following three pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginasa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. To identify a bacterial species in a sample, we performed CE-MS/MS analysis of the selected marker ions in the proteolytic digest of the cell extract and then performed protein database searches. The selected peptides that we identified correctly from Xcorr values ranking at the top of the search results allowed us to identify the corresponding bacterial species present in the sample. We have applied this method successfully to the identification of various mixtures of the three pathogens. Even minor bacterial species present at a concentration of 1% can be identified with great confidence. This method for CE-MS/MS analysis of bacteria-specific marker peptides provides excellent selectivity and high accuracy when identifying bacterial species in complex systems. In addition, we have used this approach to identify P. aeruginasa in a saliva sample spiked with E.coli and P. aeruginasa.
TI  - Survey of the susceptibility of urinary isolates to antibacterial agents in 2003.
AB  - In 2003, 826 uropathogenic strains were obtained from the urine of our patients.  We assessed their activities to antibacterial agents based on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Standards (NCCLS). Methicillin-resistant strains accounted for about 70% of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The most common gram-positive species was Enterococcus faecalis (15.6%). Enterococcus faecium was the most resistant of the enterococcal species, and the rate of susceptibility to beta-lactams (BLs), fluoroquinolones (FQs), and tetracyclines (TCs) was 0%, 6%, and less than 18%, respectively. Escherichia coli accounted for over 50% of the gram-negative bacilli. The proportion of FQ-resistant or intermediate strains was over 20%, and four of these strains (1.1%) were suspected of producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). All the ESBL-producing strains (ESBLs) possess resistance to FQs. Over 95% of Klebsiella pneumoniae was susceptible to all agents. The distribution of antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa indicated a decrease in the number of multidrug-resistant strains and an increase in strains susceptible to all agents. Some differences existed in the resistance to antibacterial agents among Proteus species. No ESBL-producing or multidrug-resistant strain was isolated from Serratia marcescens. This survey suggests that serious clinical problems will result from the increasing number of enterococcal species with multidrug resistance in gram-positive cocci, and isolates of ESBL-producing or FQs-resistant strains in gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Otomycoses of candidal origin in eastern Slovakia.
AB  - Mycological analysis of swabs and scraping samples from the external ear canals of 40 patients with clinically diagnosed otomycosis (10 neonates, 30 adults) revealed the presence of fungi as etiological agents. They were investigated microscopically using 20 % potassium hydroxide, and by cultivation on Sabouraud's glucose agar. The Candida species were identified using the germ-tube test, micromorphology observations of colonies on rice agar, and particularly by the commercial kit AUXAcolor. The following Candida species were identified in the aural material examined: C. albicans (n = 21; 52.5 %), C. parapsilosis (11; 27.5), C. tropicalis (3; 7.5), C. krusei (3; 7.5), C. guilliermondii (2; 5.0). The above yeasts were present in samples together with Staphylococcus epidermidis (31), S. aureus (16), alpha-hemolytic streptococci (14), Neisseria spp. (14), Proteus mirabilis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Escherichia coli (1) and Haemophilus influenzae (1). The most frequent predisposing factors for otomycosis were swimming in public pools and/or bath, spa and diabetes mellitus.
TI  - The effect of an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing on specific bacterial isolates at tracheostomy sites.
AB  - Patients with tracheostomies frequently experience complications, including bacteremia, sepsis, pneumonia, and multi antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. A prospective, descriptive, randomized, controlled, clinical case series involving seven men and three women was conducted on patients in the neuroscience unit of a long-term rehabilitation hospital during a period of 25 days to compare the use of an nonwoven drain sponge dressing containing an antimicrobial (polyhexamethylene biguanide) to a non-impregnated, nonwoven drain sponge dressing on tracheostomy sites. Specifically, the purpose of the study was to compare the presence of four bacterial pathogens (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) and resident normal skin flora (alpha-hemolytic Streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) at the tracheostomy sites. Culture results for total days of growth showed an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for 11 study days in patients randomized to the antimicrobial dressing group and an absence of pathogens and presence of normal skin flora for six study days in patients randomized to the control group. The results of this descriptive case series suggest that an antimicrobial drain sponge dressing could be an important adjunct in the control of infections in patients with tracheostomies without compromising normal skin flora.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Value of surveillance blood culture for early diagnosis of occult bacteremia in patients on corticosteroid therapy following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). Corticosteroids mask inflammatory responses, delaying the initiation of antibiotics. We reviewed medical records of 69 allo-SCT patients who had been on >0.5 mg/kg prednisolone to investigate the efficacy of weekly surveillance blood cultures. A total of 36 patients (52%) had positive cultures, 25 definitive BSI and 11 probable BSI. Pathogens in definitive BSI were Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=7), S. aureus (n=4), Entrococcus faecalis (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5), Acenitobacter lwoffii (n=4), and others (n=10). The median interval from the initiation of corticosteroids to the first positive cultures was 24 days (range, 1-70). At the first positive cultures, 15 patients with definitive BSI were afebrile. Four of them remained afebrile throughout the period of positive surveillance cultures. Patients with afebrile BSI tended to be older (P=0.063), and had in-dwelling central venous catheters less frequently than febrile patients (P<0.0001). Bloodstream pathogens were directly responsible for death in two patients with afebrile BSI. This study demonstrates that cortisosteroid frequently masks inflammatory reactions in allo-SCT recipients given conrticosteroids, and that surveillance blood culture is only diagnostic clue for 'occult' BSI.
TI  - [A 7-year survey of strains identified in blood cultures in a clinical hematology unit].
AB  - GOAL: This study had for aim to analyze the epidemiology of strains identified in blood cultures (hopital d'instruction des armees Percy, Clamart, France, hematology unit) to compare the rate of identified micro-organisms with literature data, and to search for a possible correlation between antibiotherapy management and evolution of resistance profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All the micro-organisms (N = 690) collected over seven years (January 1996 to December 2002), from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in conventional and sterile sector were studied. RESULTS: Gram positive cocci rate (GPC) was 62.6% and Gram negative bacilli (GNB) 31.3%. Evolution in time showed a decrease of GPC and an increase of GNB, notably the non fermenting Gram negative bacilli, leading to an equal rate by 2001-2002. The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.4%), Escherichia coli (8.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.8%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4.9%). The rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococci was 63.6%. Fifty-five percent of E. coli strains had a penicillinase phenotype. Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance was 8.5, 8.5, 6.4 and 8.5%, respectively for ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, and amikacin. CONCLUSION: This study showed a tendency to inversion of former bacteremia epidemiology with increasing negative Gram bacilli. It justifies the antibiotherapy protocols adopted in the hematology unit.
TI  - Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on Helicobacter pylori (Hp) growth. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 Hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. The inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and Hp strains, and were method dependent. The cagA status of Hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. The success and progress of Hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating Hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of Hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. Hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. These results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.
TI  - Use of the vastus lateralis muscle flap with a grooving procedure in the surgical treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the femur.
AB  - Severe femoral fractures may be associated with devascularization of cortical bone, soft-tissue loss, and significant morbidity. After surgical treatment of these femoral fractures, chronic infection may ensue and requires additional reconstructive procedures. Local muscle flap coverage is used to treat chronic osteomyelitis. A new procedure-the vastus lateralis muscle flap with grooving of the femoral shaft-was used for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the femoral shaft. The authors present 6 patients with chronic osteomyelitis of the femur who were treated with a vastus lateralis muscle flap. Five of the patients were male and the other was female. The average age of the patients was 33.8 years (range, 17-54 years). All patients experienced infection during the early postoperative period. Drainage of abscess, debridement, sequestrectomy repair of fistula, and mini fenestration were performed at least 3 times, and antibiotics were administered several times. During the operations, tissue samples were evaluated for bacterial cultivation. Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 4 patients, S. epidermidis in 1 patient, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the remaining patient. A vastus lateralis muscle flap with grooving of the infected femoral shaft is presented. The authors have not encountered a recurrence of infection during a minimum 3.9 years of follow-up. They think this technique is an alternative to the current techniques for the surgical treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the femur.
TI  - Non-steroidal anti inflammatory agents decrease bacterial colonisation of contact lenses and prevent adhesion to human corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), salicylic acid, sodium diclofenac and ketorolac for inhibition of bacterial colonization of contact lenses (CL) and human corneal epithelial cells (HCE). METHODS: CLs pre-colonised with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were exposed overnight to NSAIDs and the number of viable bacteria on the CLs were calculated. Cytotoxicity of NSAIDs to HCE cells was evaluated with the MTT assay. Viable counts were used to measure the adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE cells in the presence of the least cytotoxic NSAID. RESULTS: All NSAIDs significantly decreased bacterial colonization of CLs in a dose-dependent manner. Salicylic acid (100 mM) completely inhibited colonisation of all species tested and was the least cytotoxic. Salicylic acid also prevented adhesion of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to HCE (60% and 58% inhibition at 60 mM at 2 hours). CONCLUSIONS: Salicylic acid demonstrated potential as a compound for incorporation into anti-bacterial strategies to prevent bacterial contamination of contact lenses. This study highlighted the potential for NSAIDs as anti-bacterial agents and indicates that this class of compound should be investigated for other suitable candidates.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to poly(ethylene oxide) brushes: influence of polymer chain length and temperature.
AB  - Glass surfaces were modified by end-grafting poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) chains having molecular weights of 526, 2000, or 9800 Da. Characterization using water contact angles, ellipsometry, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the PEO brushes on the surface with estimated lengths in water of 2.8-, 7.5-, and 23.7-nm, respectively. Adhesion of two bacterial (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis) strains to these brushes was studied and compared to their adhesion to bare glass. For the bacterium P. aeruginosa and the yeast C. tropicalis, adhesion to the 2.8-nm brush was comparable to their adhesion on bare glass, whereas adhesion to the 7.5- and 23.7-nm brushes was greatly reduced. For S. epidermidis, adhesion was only slightly higher to the 2.8-nm brush than that to the longer brushes. Adhesion of the yeast C. albicans to the PEO brushes was lower than that to glass, but no differences in adhesion were found between the three brush lengths. After passage of an air bubble, nearly all microorganisms adhering to a brush were removed, irrespective of brush length, whereas retention of the adhering organisms on glass was much higher. No significant differences were found in adhesion nor retention between experiments conducted at 20 and those conducted at 37 degrees C.
TI  - In vitro exposure of bacteria to antimicrobial impregnated-central venous catheters does not directly lead to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Use of central venous catheters (CVCs) impregnated with minocycline and rifampin reduces the density of bacterial growth on catheters and decreases the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Questions have been raised over the possibility that the use of these catheters will lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. In this study, we sought to determine if in vitro exposure of four test organisms to catheter segments impregnated with minocycline and rifampin would lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Catheter segments (1.0 cm) were placed on the surface of agar plates previously inoculated with bacterial suspensions, such that a subconfluent lawn of colony growth would be apparent after 24 h incubation at 35 degrees C in air. Test organisms included American Type Culture Collection strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Zones of inhibition of colony growth surrounding catheters were measured at 24-h intervals up to 7 days (two catheter segments per test). Colonies on agar surfaces located at varying distances from catheter segments were examined for minocycline and rifampin resistance following various periods of exposure (six catheter segments per test). In addition, selected colonies were subsequently exposed to minocycline and rifampin in broth and examined for selection of minocycline and rifampin resistance (> 28 colonies per selection test). RESULTS: Inhibitory zones of 14 to 47 mm were observed with S aureus, S epidermidis, E faecalis, and E coli. Growth of P aeruginosa was not inhibited by CVC segments. Testing of colonies of the first four organisms at various distances from CVC segments after varying periods of exposure revealed only a single instance of the emergence of resistance (eg, S aureus vs rifampin). Recovery of resistant clones was enhanced with minocycline and rifampin broth selection; however, a direct link between CVC exposure and the emergence of resistance was not established. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data suggest that the exposure of Gram-positive cocci to either rifampin or minocycline can lead to the development of resistance. However, exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics in combination does not directly lead to resistance. Clinical investigations will be required to determine the true risk and implications of the development of resistance.
TI  - Endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy: Incidence, causative organisms, and  visual acuity outcomes.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence, causative organisms, and visual acuity outcomes associated with endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective, noncomparative, consecutive case series. METHODS: The medical records were reviewed of all patients who developed acute-onset postoperative endophthalmitis (within 6 weeks of surgery) after pars plana vitrectomy at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 2003. RESULTS: During the 20-year study interval, the overall incidence rate of postvitrectomy endophthalmitis was 0.039% (6/15,326). Cultured organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Proteus mirabilus (n = 1), and Staphylococcus epidermidis/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1); one case was culture-negative. Visual acuity after treatment for endophthalmitis ranged from 2/200 to no light perception, with a final vision of light perception or no light perception in four of six (67%) eyes. CONCLUSION: The incidence of endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy is low but the visual acuity outcomes after treatment are generally poor.
TI  - Traditional medicine in Sakarya province (Turkey) and antimicrobial activities of selected species.
AB  - Traditional medicine in North-West of Turkey (Sakarya province) were studied during a 2 months field study by interviewing local informants from several villages. Plant species used to treat infections were tested for antimicrobial activity. Information was collected for 46 plant species from 30 families and for 5 animal species. Twenty four of the plant species were cultivated. Most used families were Asteraceae, Cucurbitaceae, Lamiaceae and Rosaceae and the most used plants were Artemisia absinthium, Equisetum telmateia, Lavandula stoechas, Melissa officinalis, Tussilago farfara and Urtica dioica. A total of 139 medicinal uses were obtained. Plants are used mainly for infectious diseases (18%), for neurological and psychological disorders (13.7%), cardiovascular disorders (13%), skin disorders (12.2%) and respiratory disorders (10.1%). Extracts were tested in vitro for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 65538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231, using microbroth dilution technique according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). This research showed that Arum maculatum, Datura stramonium, Geranium asphodeloides and Equisetum telmateia petroleum ether extracts had MIC values of 39.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml, 78.1 microg/ml and 39.1 microg/ml, respectively against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Datura stramonium petroleum ether extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli and Trachystemon orientalis ethanol extract had a MIC value of 39.1 microg/ml against Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial activity of Arum maculatum, Equisetum telmateia, Geranium asphodeloides, Plantago intermedia, Senecio vulgaris and Trachystemon orientalis has been reported here for the first time.
TI  - In vitro testing of antimicrobial activity of bone cement.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish a reliable and cost-effective microplate proliferation assay for in vitro antimicrobial testing of bone cement samples. Cement samples devoid of antimicrobial agents, loaded with 2% gentamicin or with different concentrations of high-porosity silver, were incubated in a 96-well microplate with several staphylococcal, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecium isolates exhibiting different susceptibilities to gentamicin. After being rinsed, the samples were brought into a soy medium in which adherent cells on the cement surface either were killed by the antimicrobial surface or started to release clonal counterparts. The medium was monitored in real time by recording a time proliferation curve for each well. Microplate testing revealed no antibacterial effect of plain bone cement. The antibacterial activity of gentamicin-loaded bone cement was shown by the microplate test to depend on the gentamicin susceptibilities of the strains. The effect of high-porosity silver was dose dependent. Bactericidal activity against all tested strains was found for bone cement loaded with 1% high-porosity silver. The accuracy of this new proliferation assay was shown by the high correlation between the types of proliferation curves and antibiotic susceptibility. In contrast to routine agar diffusion testing, it assesses the dynamic response of microorganisms to antimicrobial agents in biomaterials and allows high-throughput screening and detection of antimicrobial properties of poorly water-soluble compounds like silver.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial properties of aqueous garlic extract against multidrug-resistant bacteria and Candida species from Nigeria.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of aqueous garlic extract (AGE) against 133 multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., and Proteus spp., and against 10 Candida spp. were studied. Antibacterial activity of AGE by well-diffusion and macrobroth dilution method was characterized by inhibition zones of 20.2-22.7 mm for gram-positives and 19.8-24.5 mm for gram-negatives and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranges of 15.6-48.3 mg/mL and 22.9-37.2 mg/mL, respectively. With the exception of P. aeruginosa, the observed disparity in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours was not significant (P >.05) in these isolates. The anticandidal effect of AGE resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 27.4 +/- 3.7 mm with no significant difference (P >.05) in MIC values at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Minimum fungicidal concentrations were found to be 14.9 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively, at these incubation periods. Further analysis revealed the antimicrobial efficacy of AGE to be dose and time dependent, producing five distinct time-kill profiles among the isolates tested. The results of this study support the use of garlic in health products and herbal remedies in Nigeria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2002). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 491 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 13 institutions in Japan were supplied between August 2002 and July 2003. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 578 strains were estimated as causative bacteria and used for the investigation. The number of them was 578 strains consisting of 177 gram-positive bacterial strains (30.6%) and 401 gram-negative bacterial strains (69.4%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 1 microg/mL. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus epidermidis to cephems including cefotiam (CTM) was relatively good. Against Enterococcus faecalis, ampicillin (ABPC), imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed the strongest antibacterial activity (MIC90: 2-4 microg/mL). In addition, the low sensitive strains (MIC: > or = 256 microg/mL) to clarithromycin (CAM) were detected at 48.3% but none to cefozopran (CZOP). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the highest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 13.5%, which was higher than that in the last year. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Citrobacter freundii was generally low but CZOP and CPR had a strong acitivity (MIC90: 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The antibacterial activity of cephems to Klebsiella pneumoniae was good and especially cefmenoxime (CMX), cefixime (CFIX), flomoxef (FMOX), CPR, and CZOP showed stronger activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Against Serratia marcescens, meropenem (MEPM) had the highest antibacterial activity followed by CPR and CZOP. Against Proteus mirabilis, CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, MEPM, carumonam (CRMN), and levofloxacin (LVFX) showed the strongest activity (MC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Among other cephems, CZOP and CFIX were also strong (MIC90: 0.25 microg/mL). The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs were ranged from 64 to > or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 8 microg/mL).
TI  - Newer carbapenems for urinary tract infections.
AB  - Four carbapenems have been available clinically in Japan. These are imipenem/cilastatin (IMIP/CS) and panipenem/ betamipron (PANI/BP) of the older compounds and newer carbapenems such as biapem (BIAP) and meropenem (MERO). The latter compounds are relatively stable to dehydropeptidase-1 (DHP-1) and have been reported to have higher antimicrobial activities compared to the earlier carbapenems. The antimicrobial activity of these four carbapenems against fresh urinary isolates showed high activities against Enterobacteriacae such as Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Escherichia coli containing the class C-beta-lactamase- and extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains compared to piperacillin (PIPC) and ceftazidime (CTAZ). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the carbapenems, with the exception of panipenem showed strong antimicrobial activities compared to PIPC and CTAZ. High activities were also seen against Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but methicillin-resistant strains were not affected. The first generation carbapenems showed better activity against E. faecalis than newer carbapenems. All four carbapenems were similar in clinical effectiveness in double blind trials for complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). However, PANI/BP is less effective in UTIs caused by P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. MERO showed better eradication rate of P. aeruginosa than IMIP/CS. Retrospective analysis of treated cases using carbapenems showed a rapid defervescence in the treatment of febrile complicated UTIs, which were mainly caused by mixed infection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, especially those involving P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis.
TI  - Bacteriostatic properties of biomatrices against common orthopaedic pathogens.
AB  - Tissue-engineered grafts for tissue regeneration include either mature or progenitor cells seeded onto biomatrices that provide shape and support for developing tissue. Popular biomaterials used in orthopaedic surgery include collagen type I, hyaluronic acid, hydroxyapatite, and polylactic polyglycolic acid (PLGA). Biomatrices with bacteriostatic properties may be beneficial in promoting tissue-engineered graft survival in patients susceptible to infection. We evaluated the bacteriostatic effects of these biomaterials on the growth of the four most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hyaluronic acid demonstrated the largest bacteriostatic effect on these pathogens by inhibiting bacterial growth by an average of 76.8% (p = 0.0005). Hydroxyapatite and collagen inhibited growth on average by 49.7% (p = 0.011) and 37.5% (p = 0.102), respectively. PLGA exhibited the least bacteriostasis with an average inhibition of 9.8% (NS) and actually accelerated the growth of beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro assessment of chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated polyurethane foam antimicrobial dressing using zone of inhibition assays.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an antimicrobial dressing consisting of hydrophilic polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate for activity against several antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates as well as American Type Culture Collection reference strains using zone of inhibition assays. METHODS: Sterile foam samples with chlorhexidine gluconate and untreated controls were transferred onto inoculated agar plates. Plates were incubated at 35 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 24 hours and examined for zones of inhibition around the foam samples. RESULTS: Polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate showed antimicrobial activity in vitro against all of the challenge organisms including antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: The data from this in vitro study support the hypothesis that polyurethane foam with chlorhexidine gluconate has an antimicrobial effect against antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species, as well as Candida species.
TI  - Conservative medical therapy of prosthetic joint infections: retrospective analysis of an 8-year experience.
AB  - Successful treatment of prosthetic joint infections often requires multiple surgical interventions and prolonged antimicrobial therapy. However, in certain situations, a surgical approach may not be in the best interest of the patient. A conservative approach was used to treat 34 patients with prosthetic joint infection between 1995 and 2003. Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical-microbiological evidence, confirmed by (99)Tc-labelled leukocyte scintigraphy, and involved 12 Staphylococcus aureus infections, nine Staphylococcus epidermidis infections, two Enterococcus faecalis infections, two mixed infections (S. aureus plus Pseudomonas aeruginosa; S. epidermidis plus E. faecalis), with the infecting pathogen being unidentified for nine patients. Most infections were treated initially with intravenous or intramuscular teicoplanin +/- ciprofloxacin or rifampicin, followed by oral ciprofloxacin or minocycline plus rifampicin. The mean duration of antimicrobial therapy was 41.2 weeks. Overall, only three patients did not respond to therapy, and infection was controlled in the remaining 31 patients. Among these, no relapse was observed in 17 patients during follow-up for 9-57 months; improvement with early (within 6 months of antibiotic discontinuation) or late relapse was observed in seven and three patients, respectively; two patients improved clinically, but continued to receive antibiotic therapy; and two patients whose condition improved initially were lost after a 6-month follow-up following discontinuation of antibiotics. No patient complained of side effects requiring discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. The study confirmed that suppression of infection, with salvage of the infected device in an acceptably functional state, can be achieved in selected cases.
TI  - Nitric oxide-releasing sol-gels as antibacterial coatings for orthopedic implants.
AB  - To assess the benefits of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing sol-gels as potential antibacterial coatings for orthopedic devices, medical-grade stainless steel is coated with a sol-gel film of 40% N-aminohexyl-N-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and 60% isobutyltrimethoxysilane. Upon converting the diamine groups in these films to diazeniumdiolate NO donors, the NO release from the sol-gel-coated stainless steel is evaluated at both ambient and physiological temperature. Sol-gel films incubated at 25 degrees C have a lower NO flux over the first 24 h compared to those at 37 degrees C, but release more than five times longer. The bacterial adhesion resistance of NO-releasing coatings is evaluated in vitro by exposing bare steel, sol-gel, and NO-releasing sol-gel-coated steel to cell suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 25 degrees C and 37 degrees C. Cell adhesion to bare and sol-gel-coated steel is similar, while NO-releasing surfaces have significantly less bacterial adhesion for all species and temperatures investigated.
TI  - The influence of substratum topography on bacterial adhesion to polymethyl methacrylate.
AB  - The effect of substratum roughness on the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and  Staphylococcus epidermidis was investigated using PMMA. A small increase in Ra values (0.04-1.24 microm) resulted in a significant increase (P<0.05) in bacterial attachment. Subsequent increases in surface roughness (Ra=1.86-7.89 microm) resulted in a decrease in adhesion, although adhesion was still higher than to the smooth surface. When the PMMA surfaces were coated with protein (bovine serum albumin), no difference (P<0.05) could be determined in the amount of protein adsorbed, irrespective of surface topography. However, the influence of the underlying topography on adhesion was still evident. Substratum topography is an important parameter affecting bacterial adhesion to surfaces.
TI  - Infection following orthopaedic implants and bone surgery.
AB  - Forty-seven patients were investigated for early or late postoperative infections of orthopaedic implants and/or bone. A total of 88 isolates were recovered (64 aerobes and 24 anaerobes). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the most common causative agents. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 16 (34%) patients; 50% of patients with late-onset infection and 10.5% with early-onset infection. In 6 (12.8%) patients, infection was with anaerobic organisms alone. All these patients had retained an extramedullary internal fixation device. Anaerobic microorganisms appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of late-onset postoperative infection, especially where there is an extramedullary internal fixation device.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Studies on cultured and uncultured microbiota of wild culex quinquefasciatus mosquito midgut based on 16s ribosomal RNA gene analysis.
AB  - To describe the midgut microbial diversity and the candidate bacteria for the genetic manipulation for the generation of transgenic mosquitoes refractory to transmission of diseases, the microbiota of wild Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito midgut was studied using a conventional culture technique and analysis of a 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence library. The culturable microbiota was identified as Acinetobacter junii, Ac. calcoaceticus, Aeromonas culicicola, Bacillus thuringiensis, Microbacterium oxydans, Pantoea agglomerans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomonas maltophila and an unidentified bacterium from the host Drosophila paulistorium. The 16S rRNA gene library was composed of 46% unidentified and uncultured bacteria, 41% Acinetobacter spp., and 13% Lactococcus spp. The coverage calculated for the 150 clones was 83.3%. Thus, the probability of the next cloned sequence falling in a novel operational taxonomic unit (not yet observed) was 16.7%. The majority of the cultured isolates and the 16S rRNA gene library clones belonged to the gamma-proteobacteria class. Most of the bacteria have been previously reported to inhabit the midgut of different mosquito species. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that different mosquito species harbor common representatives of the microbiota that may be the potential candidates for genetic manipulation to control the disease transmission capabilities of the host.
TI  - Prosthesis culture 6 months after implantation and the effect of haematogenous seeding in a rat model.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of haematogenous seeding in late prosthesis infection. In all, 45 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three equal groups. A small piece of silicone prosthesis was implanted into the scrotum of all rats under sterile condition and antibiotic prophylaxis. In the first group, all silicones were removed after 6 months without any complication and were cultured for bacterial growth. In the second group, a disc, which was saturated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, was inoculated subcutaneously in the legs of the rats in the 6th month, revealing a nodule formation 4-5 days after the inoculation and treated with an appropriate antibiotic after the nodule formation. In the third group, the same disc was inoculated, but all rats were treated immediately from the inoculation time onwards. The silicones of the second and third group were also removed at the end of the 6th month and were cultured to observe the bacterial growth. There was no evidence of prosthesis infection in any of the three groups. In the first group, three cultures were positive and revealed approximately 10 000 colonies of S. epidermidis in two and Proteus mirabilis in the remaining. Three and four cultures were positive in the second and third group, respectively. Low colonies of four different organisms (Escherichia coli, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were identified in these cultures. There was no statistical significance of positive cultures in the three groups. Based on our results, there does not appear to be a true significance of haematogenous seeding on late prosthesis infection.
TI  - In vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts.
AB  - The serious medical consequences and costly management of infections associated with vascular grafts have prompted an expanding interest in examining the preventive efficacy of antimicrobial-coated vascular grafts. The purpose of antimicrobial coating of vascular grafts is to reduce bacterial colonization of the device and, hopefully, the occurrence of clinical infection. In this study we demonstrated that expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, as reflected by zones of inhibition, against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We also showed in a rabbit model that subcutaneously placed minocycline/rifampin-coated vascular grafts have lower rates of staphylococcal device colonization (1/24 = 4% vs. 8/30 = 27%, p = 0.033) and device-related infection (0/24 = 0% vs. 6/30 = 20%, p = 0.028) than uncoated grafts. These promising results encourage the clinical evaluation of vascular grafts coated with minocycline and rifampin.
TI  - Sterility of glaucoma medications among chronic users in the community.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the sterility of topical glaucoma medications among chronic  glaucoma medication users in the community. SETTING: Glaucoma service, Sanz Medical Center, Laniado Hospital, Netanya. Research mode: Cross-sectional laboratory and clinical study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chronic glaucoma patients were asked to submit their topical glaucoma preparations to the microbiology laboratory at Laniado hospital. Samples taken from the interior of the bottle and the tip were cultured using MacConkey agar, blood agar, and chocolate agar plates. RESULTS: Sixty-two bottles of topical glaucoma medications used by 27 patients were tested. Bacterial growth was detected in eight (12.9%) preparations, three of which revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Streptococcus viridans, and one Klebsiella. During the study, acute conjunctivitis was found in one patient, possibly due to the use of infected drops. In another case, two identical medications, which had been used simultaneously for more than 6 weeks by the same patient, were found to be infected. CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma topical preparations are generally found safe in terms of sterility, though bacterial growth may be found in a small percentage. In most cases, the cause of the loss of sterility could not be determined. However, in two preparations, contamination was related to the noncompliance of the patient who continued using the same preparation longer than instructed. It is imperative to increase the awareness of glaucoma patients to the fact that improper use can lead to eye-drop contamination.
TI  - [Nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2002].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem (MEPM) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 899 strains of Gram-positive bacteria, 1500 strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and 158 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 28 medical institutions during 2002 was measured. The results were as follows; 1. MEPM was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against Gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC90 of MEPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the lowest of the drugs tested. MEPM showed low cross-resistant rate against both imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa. MEPM was active against most of the species tested in Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). 2. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in Escherichia coli and 1.9% (2 strains) in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenems including MEPM were active against these ESBL strains. In conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that MEPM retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful carbapenem; at present, 7 years after available for commercial use.
TI  - Kidney transplants from infected donors: our experience.
AB  - Organ procurement from infected donors may transmit a disease to the recipient that could cause a graft loss and/or recipient morbidity. Retrospectively, all kidney transplants from infected donors at our center in the last 4 years were reviewed. A donor was considered infected in the presence of at least one positive culture before procurement. From January 1999 to 2003, 23 of 160 donors (14.5%) were infected: in 10 donors a positive blood culture; in 3, a urine culture; and in 13, a bronchial culture. In a further 12 (7%) donors, only the preservation solution was contaminated. Organisms isolated were: Staphylococcus coagulase.neg. (n = 7); Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 3); Staphylococcus aureus (n = 6); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4); Acinetobacter (n = 1); Candida albicans (n = 13); Aspergillus (n = 1); and Escherichia coli (n = 1). All except 2 kidneys were transplanted with positivity in all cultures. All recipients received general, nonspecific, antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis until the antibiotic and antifungal spectrum was ready. Patient and graft survival rates at 6 months were 94% and 93%, respectively. Two deaths occurred due to bacterial arteritis (P aeruginosa), and 2 acute graft losses due to fungal arteritis. Kidneys from infected donors seem suitable for transplants. Only grafts infected by vasculotropic agents (S aureus, P aeruginosa, and C albicans) should be discarded.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Peritoneal fluid titer test for peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.
AB  - Standard microbiological tests (i.e., MIC) do not account for the unique factors  of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis which can significantly influence treatment response. Our goals were to develop a peritoneal fluid titer (PFT) test and to conduct a pilot study of its association with clinical outcome. The methodology was developed by using spent dialysate collected from patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis prior to the initiation of antibiotics. Dialysate was processed and spiked with antibiotic to simulate two standard intraperitoneal regimens: cefazolin plus tobramycin and cefazolin alone. Thirty-six clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were tested. In the pilot study, dialysate was collected from 14 patients with bacterial PD-related peritonitis. Titers were determined by using each patient's dialysate and infecting pathogen. Titers were highly reproducible, with discrepancies in only 1% of cases. Overall, PFTs were notably higher against gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.0001). The addition of tobramycin increased titers significantly from zero to values of 1/16 to 1/64 against E. cloacae and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.0001). In the pilot study, peritoneal fluid inhibitory titers were significantly associated with clinical outcome, with a median value of 1/96 for patients who were cured compared to 1/32 for those who failed treatment (P = 0.036). In conclusion, this study provides preliminary support for the PFT as a pharmacodynamic index specific to the treatment of PD-related peritonitis. With further characterization and validation in patients, the PFT test may advance the study of antibiotic therapies for PD-related peritonitis.
TI  - Interactions of Candida albicans with other Candida spp. and bacteria in the biofilms.
AB  - AIMS: To study the interactions between Candida albicans and 12 other species of  Candida and bacteria in biofilms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The number of cells within growing biofilms in a polystyrene tube model was measured after adding C. albicans to preformed biofilms of other micro-organisms and vice versa. It was also measured after simultaneous biofilm formation of C. albicans and other micro-organisms. The number of cells of C. albicans within the growing biofilms decreased significantly (P < 0.05) when the fungus was added to preformed biofilms of Candida spp. and bacteria except, with C. parapsilosis, Torulopsis glabrata and the glycocalyx producer Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When C. parapsilosis, Staphylococcus epidermidis (nonglycocalyx producer) or Serratia marcescens was added to preformed biofilms of C. albicans, the number of cells of these micro-organisms increased in the growing biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: Biofilms of C. albicans are capable of holding other micro-organisms and more likely to be heterogeneous with other bacteria and fungi in the environment and on medical devices. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Recognition of the heterogeneity of biofilm-associated organisms can influence treatment decisions, particularly in patients who do not respond to initial appropriate therapy.
TI  - Nosocomial ocular infection--a prospective study.
AB  - Nosocomial infection of the eye is an uncommon complication, acquired during the  course of hospital management. It may prolong the disease process or even destroy the eye. The overall incidence varies considerably by hospital services. To ascertain the various types of ocular infections and its responsible pathogens, a laboratory-based, nosocomial ocular infection control study was performed in a large referral hospital during a period of January 1997 to June 1999. The study revealed 29 cases (0.08%) of culture proven ocular infections, out of 35,758 total admission during the period of one calendar year. Fifty-one eyes of 29 cases (22 bilateral) had nosocomial infection. Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), were the most frequent bacteria. Laboratory investigations helped in initiation and modification of specific antimicrobial therapy and also prognosis. Proper surveillance with the help of laboratory investigations has effective role in the management of nosocomial ocular infection.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Synthesis of some new 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide derivatives and their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - In this study, 14 new compounds having 6-methyl-N2-(alkylidene/cycloalkylidene)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carbohydrazide (3a-g), 3-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-4-thiazolidinone (4a-d) and 4-[[(6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-yl)carbonyl]amino]-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]no nan/[4.5]decan-3-one (4e-g) structures were synthesized. The structures of the compounds were elucidated by UV, IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 1H-13C-COSY, mass spectra and elemental analysis. All compounds synthesized were tested for antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Only 4d and 4f demonstrated antimicrobial activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 19.5 microg/ml and 39 microg/ml, respectively).
TI  - [Increasing trend of antimicrobial drug-resistance in organisms causing bacteremia at a tertiary-care hospital: 1995 to 2000].
AB  - We described the trends of drug-resistant organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a teaching hospital from 1995 to 2000. We found an increase in the number of clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Enterococcus spp, resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat infections caused by these organisms. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones increased during the period of study, and in 2000 more than 20% of the isolates were resistant. In contrast, the frequency of resistance to aminoglycosides and carbapenems was less than 20%. The frequency of resistant staphylococci increased exuberantly fifty fold to quinolones and five fold to oxacillin during the study period, therefore in 2000, 26.1% of S. aureus isolates and 61% of S. epidermidis were resistant to oxacillin. The frequency of resistant enterococci also increased, and in 2000, 50% were resistant to ampicillin, and 37.5% to gentamicin. The increase of drug resistant organisms isolated in blood had a direct impact in the empirical treatment of severely infected patients in our hospital. It is important to continuously supervise antibiotic use, and to adopt more strict control measures to decrease the frequency of infections caused by drug resistant organisms.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - Poly(ethylene glycol)-polyacrylate copolymers modified to control adherent monocyte-macrophage physiology: interactions with attaching Staphylococcus epidermidis or Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria.
AB  - The ability of various surface modifications of poly(ethylene glycol)-graft-polyacrylate (PEG-g-PA) copolymers (tethered adhesion peptides and fragments of monoclonal antibodies) to modulate monocyte-macrophage cell interactions with surface colonizing bacteria is reported. The PEG-g-PA copolymers were made to inhibit nonspecific protein and cellular adhesion. The copolymers were then covalently modified with either cell adhesion peptides (YRGDS, YEILDV, or YRGES) or fragments of antibodies to monocyte-macrophage integrin receptors (anti-VLA4, anti-beta(1), anti-beta(2), and anti-CD64), which are known to enhance macrophage adhesion and perhaps modulate their activation. Cytokine expression and phagocytosis response by surface adherent monocyte-macrophages to Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria were quantified. The cytokine expression (interleukins 6 and 1 beta) of adherent macrophages in response to the modified polymers only and to bacterial challenges were quantified by dynamic ELISA assays. The adherent macrophage phagocytic response (oxidative burst) to various materials is compared to oxidative responses to both opsonized and nonopsonized S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa bacteria. The efficiency of adherent macrophages to ingest and kill both species was determined using radiolabeled and fluorescent labeled bacterial cell ingestion studies as a function of the PEG-g-PA surface modification. Materials modified with adhesion peptides marginally enhanced (2x) macrophage attachment versus controls but, upon bacterial challenges, these materials predisposed adherent macrophages to overexpress proinflammatory cytokines and to exhibit a significant phagocytic response. Conversely, PEG-g-PA materials modified by fragments of monoclonal antibodies significantly enhanced (7x) macrophage adhesion but, upon bacterial challenge, "per cell" cytokine expression levels were reduced compared to peptide modified materials. Macrophages adhering to antibody fragment modified surfaces also exhibited sustained enhanced phagocytic response and higher bacterial killing efficiencies when compared with peptide modified materials.
TI  - Different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  - We examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods. Compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of EGCg against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, and S. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher MICs (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against Gram-negative rods, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. And difference was observed between the binding abilities of EGCg with viable S. aureus and with E. coli. The bactericidal activity of EGCg for S. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide or dextran. It was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of EGCg. These results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different affinities of EGCg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the different susceptibilities of Staphylococcus and Gram-negative rods to EGCg.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Surgical site infections in breast surgery: case-control study.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to estimate the frequency of surgical site infections (SSIs) and identify associated risk factors for each type of breast surgery at a cancer hospital. We used a nested case-control design. Between February 1, 2000 and July 31, 2000, all breast surgeries performed were recorded on a daily basis. After hospital discharge, we evaluated patients simultaneously with surgeons three times a week for 30 days or longer. The odds ratio (OR) was estimated using logistic regression analysis. The study followed 280 patients (298 wounds). Altogether, 77 SSIs were detected, for an overall SSI rate of 25.8% (77/298). For excisions, conservative surgery, and radical mastectomies the SSI rates were 1.4%, 18.0%, and 38.3%, respectively. Excisions were excluded ( n = 68) for risk factor analysis. After multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with SSIs were obesity [OR 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.3], concomitant chemotherapy and radiation (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.3), radical surgery (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.6), insertion of a second drain during the late postoperative period (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.8-7.8), and drainage duration > or = 19 days (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5-5.6). The bacteria most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n = 18 ), Serratia sp. ( n = 18), Staphylococcus aureus ( n = 10), and Staphylococcus epidermidis ( n = 10). Poor compliance with infection control practices and wound management was detected throughout the study period. The overall frequency of SSIs for mastectomies was higher than the reported rates, which was principally related to the more radical surgery required for advanced-stage disease, preoperative irradiation, and inadequate wound and drain care.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of multiple-dose vials: a prevalence study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Two patients died of a meningitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a hospital in Germany in July 2001, their infections having been caused by a contaminated contrast media (iomeprol [Imeron]) used as a multiple-dose vial (MDV) over 8 days. Therefore, a prevalence study was performed to investigate the use and contamination of multiple-use vials in a tertiary hospital. METHODS: In a 1300-bed hospital on a specific day in November 2001, all used MDVs were collected by the infection control nurses. Information was recorded about the medication, labeling of vials, storing temperature, wards, and dates of opening. Each vial was also tested for sterility. RESULTS: Opened vials were to be found in all wards. Of the 227 vials available, 1 vial and 1 spike were contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis (contamination rate 0.9%; 95% CI, 0.3-2.1). The opening dates were marked on only 114 (50%) MDVs, 15 (13%) of which had already expired. Only 44 (19%) MDVs had been stored in the refrigerator, whereas 109 MDVs contained medications without any preserving agent. CONCLUSION: Results revealed somewhat risky handling of MDVs. In light of a possible high risk in this hospital of about 1 contaminated MDV per day, and in view of many reported outbreaks induced by contaminated MDVs, the following infection control measures were encouraged: alcohol hand hygiene, the disinfection of gums, observance of the manufacturer's recommendations, appropriate storing temperatures, marking the opening time, and avoiding the multiple use of medications not containing preserving agents.
TI  - Protein and bacterial fouling characteristics of peptide and antibody decorated surfaces of PEG-poly(acrylic acid) co-polymers.
AB  - The potential for base poly(ethylene glycol) graft poly(acrylic acid) PEG-g-PA copolymers and surface-modified PEG-g-PA materials to inhibit random protein fouling and bacterial adhesion are investigated. PEG-g-PA co-polymers were synthesized that inhibited non-specific protein and cellular adhesion. PEG-g-PA co-polymers were then covalently modified with either cell adhesion peptides (YRGDS, YEILDV) or fragments of antibodies to monocyte/macrophage integrin receptors (Anti-VLA4, Anti-beta1, Anti-beta2, and Anti-CD64) known to enhance macrophage adhesion and, perhaps, modulate their activation. Materials produced in this work were characterized using: hydrophobicity by contact angle; angle-resolved X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to confirm the presence of PEG in the bulk material and the surface; degree of hydration; differential scanning calorimetry; and thermal gravimetric analysis. To evaluate the non-fouling efficacy of the various modified surfaces, three proteins, human serum albumin, human fibronectin (Fraction I) and human immunoglobulin were 125I labeled. Samples of base PEG-g-PA and PEG-g-PA, modified with various peptides, were exposed to solutions containing either 2 or 200 microg/ml of one of the labeled proteins at 37 degrees C for 24 h. PEG-g-PA substrata modified with directly bound peptides exhibited protein adsorption that varied depending upon the surface bounded peptide. PEG-g-PA modified with peptides linked by linear PEG tethers reduced protein adsorption at 24 h by approximately 45% in comparison to PEG-g-PA. Peptides linked by way of StarPEO and StarlikePEO tethers further decreased protein adsorption in comparison to PEG-g-PA. The ability of peptide:PEOtethers to inhibit protein adsorption appeared to be a function of type and surface coverage of the PEO tether and not influenced by the amount or molecular structure the tethered peptide. Peptides directly coupled to the PEG-g-PA increased the amount of protein fouling relative to controls and there appeared to be some dependency of the amount of protein adsorption on which peptide was tethered. Two 14C-labeled pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were used to quantify the degree of bacterial adhesion using two types of laminar flow cell chambers; one that provided invasive sampling of the target substrata and one that provided non-invasive microscopic surveillance of adhering bacterial cells. Attachment of both species to PEG-g-PA and peptide-modified PEG-g-PA was reduced compared to the basic poly(acrylic acid). Presence of peptides on the surface, whether directly bound or bound by the PEO tether did not influence adhesion of P. aeruginosa relative to controls. S. epidermidis adhesion rates increased slightly for those materials where peptides were directly bound to the surface but were reduced relative to base PEG-g-PA when peptides were bound by PEO tethers. All PEG-g-PA surfaces modified with fragments of monoclonal antibodies dramatically enhanced bacterial initial adhesion rates and maximum extent of attachment.
TI  - Treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis with topical trovafloxacin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the therapeutic role of trovafloxacin mesylate, a newer-generation fluoroquinolone with an expanded spectrum of activity, in the treatment of experimental bacterial keratitis. METHODS: Susceptibility studies were performed on various strains of ocular isolates to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, using the E-test method. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed by a single topical administration of trovafloxacin to rabbit eyes with either an intact or denuded corneal epithelium. Aqueous humor, vitreous, and corneal concentrations of trovafloxacin were determined at different time points. Experimental bacterial keratitis studies were performed in rabbit eyes. Three identical studies were conducted using Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therapy groups included 0.5% trovafloxacin, 0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. After 12 hours of drops administration, corneas were excised, homogenized, and serially plated. The main outcome measure was quantitative bacteriologic analysis for residual colony-forming units. RESULTS: In vitro susceptibility study findings indicated that the MIC of trovafloxacin was significantly lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, lower than the MIC of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and intermediate between ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin for P. aeruginosa. Pharmacokinetic studies showed a significant concentration of trovafloxacin in the treated corneas, especially in eyes with a denuded epithelium. All serum samples had undetectable trovafloxacin concentrations. Experimental keratitis studies showed a statistically significant decrease of colony-forming units in trovafloxacin-treated eyes in the S. aureus model and a similar decrease in the S pneumoniae and P aeruginosa models. CONCLUSIONS: Topical 0.5% trovafloxacin proved to be an effective ocular medication for the therapy of gram-positive and gram-negative keratitis. Clinical Relevance Trovafloxacin may provide an excellent therapeutic alternative in bacterial keratitis.
TI  - [Impact of secondary pancreatic infection on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis: an analysis of 60 cases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of secondary pancreatic infection (SPI) on the prognosis of patients with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: Clinical data of 60 patients with SAP (January 1, 1980-December 31, 1999), especially the data at the onset of SPI, were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty patients were divided into two groups: SPI group (29 cases) and non-SPI group (31 cases). There was no significant difference in gender, average age, scores of Ranson and of high risk factors of China Medical Association between two groups, but the average stay days in hospital, payment, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, days of fever, prehospital days, days of high white blood cell (WBC) count, the duration of constipation after the onset of SAP and average times of operation were significantly higher in SPI group than that of non-SPI group. Fatality rate of SPI group (7/29, 24.14 percent) was higher than that of non-SPI (1/31, 3.23 percent). There were 14 cases of infection with single microorganism (48.3 percent) and 15 cases of mixed infection (51.7 percent) in SPI group. Twenty-seven patients were infected with bacteria of Enterobacteriaecae (Escherichia 25, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Proteus morgani 1, 8 with bacteria of Pseudomonas (P. aeruginosa 7, P. stanieri 1), 2 with fungus, 5 with other bacteria (Bacillus subtilis 2, Tetracoccus 1, Acetobacteraceae 1, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) in SPI group. Only in 2 patients with infective pancreatic necrosis the blood culture was positive (Escherichia coli). CONCLUSION: These results showed that the major source of SPI is entergenous, and SPI would affect the prognosis of SAP patients. With the present therapeutic regimes it was hard to prevent entergenous infections. It is necessary to find a new strategy.
TI  - Microbiological infections in HIV positive Bahraini patients with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count.
AB  - The correlation of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and the distribution of pathogenic or  opportunistic microbial infection most commonly found in HIV positive individuals differ from one area to the other. The present study reports such findings in 67 HIV positive Bahraini patients in the period May 1997 to Nov. 1998. CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was measured using flow cytometry. Bacterial and fungal cultures were performed. Serological diagnosis was performed when indicated. Viral study was done serologically. The distribution of CD4+ T-lymphocyte count in the studied group was: 21 patients (31.3%) less than 100 cells/microl, 5 patients (7.5%) 100-200 cells/microl, 25 patients (37.3%) 201-500 cells/microl and 16 patients (23.9%) with count more than 500 cells/microl. Among patients with low CD4 count (less than 100 cells/microl) (n=21), microbial infections varied from fungal infections 66%, bacterial infections 57% and viral infections 4.8%. Bacterial infections included Salmonellosis (14.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.5%), H. influenzae (9.5%), Legionellosis (4.8%) and E. coli (4.8%). Fungal infection included Candida albicans (52.4%), Pneumocystis carinii (9.5%), Cryptococcus neoformans (4.8%). Viral infection included H. simplex to (4.8%). Fungal infections were the highest common infection in thus study. The most common microbial infection was Candida albicans. P. carinii and Cryptococcus neoformans were less common than found in other studies world wide.
TI  - Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension is superior to ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of children with acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic suspension compared with ofloxacin otic solution in the treatment of acute otitis media with otorrhea through tympanostomy tubes (AOMT) in pediatric patients. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, randomized, observer-masked, parallel-group study was conducted at 39 sites in 599 children aged >or=6 months to 12 years with an AOMT episode of <or=3 weeks' duration. The mean age of patients was 2.5 years (standard deviation: 2.37 years). Patients received either ciprofloxacin 0.3%/dexamethasone 0.1% otic suspension 4 drops twice daily for 7 days or ofloxacin 0.3% otic solution 5 drops twice daily for 10 days. Clinical signs and symptoms of AOMT were evaluated at clinic visits on days 1 (baseline), 3 (on therapy), 11 (end of therapy), and 18 (test of cure). A patient diary was used to measure time to cessation of otorrhea. Principal pretherapy pathogens included Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (12.4%), S epidermidis (10.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (4.1%). RESULTS: Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone is superior to ofloxacin for clinical cure (90% vs 78%) and microbiologic success (92% vs 81.8%) at the test-of-cure visit, produces fewer treatment failures (4.4% vs 14.1%), and results in a shorter median time to cessation of otorrhea (4 days vs 6 days). Ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is also superior to improvement in clinical response by visit, absence of otorrhea by visit, and reduction of otorrhea volume by visit. Both topical otic preparations are safe and well tolerated in pediatric patients. No change in speech recognition threshold or decrease in hearing from baseline, based on audiometric testing, was noted with either regimen. CONCLUSION: Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone treatment is superior to topical ofloxacin in the treatment of AOMT.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2001). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of September and December 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to a variety of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 496 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.6% and Gram-negative bacteria as 70.4%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed a strong activity, and this drug also had a strong activity against MRSA in preventing growth of all strains at 1 microgram/mL. In addition, arbekacin (ABK) showed strong activity with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains at 4 micrograms/mL. ABK also showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis in preventing growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. Ampicillin (ABPC) and cefozopran (CZOP) showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 8 micrograms/mL). ABPC, imipenem (IPM), and VCM showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase of low-susceptible strains in E. faecalis was observed against these antimicrobial agents. Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed the highest activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL; IPM prevented growth of all strains at 0.5 microgram/mL. CZOP and cefotiam (CTM) also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/mL; MIC90 of CTM was within 0.5 microgram/mL. Quinolone-resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 9.3%, which was lower than that in the last year, and was higher level than those in up to 1999. MEPM showed the strongest activity against Citrobacter freundii in preventing growth of all strains at 0.125 microgram/mL. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/mL. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of gentamicin (GM) was the lowest value being 2 micrograms/mL, and those of IPM and carumonam were 8 and 16 micrograms/mL, respectively. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost all drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of GM was 8 micrograms/mL, those of IPM and amikacin were 16 micrograms/mL, and those of all other drugs were over than 32 micrograms/mL.
TI  - The biocompatibility of crosslinkable copolymer coatings containing sulfobetaines and phosphobetaines.
AB  - The comparison of copolymers containing sulfobetaine or phosphobetaine moieties for use as potential biocompatible coatings has been investigated. Two statistical copolymers were produced by a free radical polymerisation technique, one based on a sulfobetaine and the other on a phosphobetaine, both with a silyl group component to allow thermal crosslinking after coating. PMMA and glass discs were dip-coated with the polymers and their properties were compared to the uncoated controls. Bacterial adhesion to these coated materials was assessed using Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Human macrophages and granulocytes were used to assess the adhesion and activation of inflammatory cells whilst mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells were used to assess the propensity for the materials to support fibroblast cell adhesion. In all cases the polymer coatings reduced cell adhesion with respect to the base materials. The phosphobetaine-based copolymer coatings were shown to be markedly superior to the sulfobetaine-based copolymer coatings.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of vegetables and juices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the antibacterial activities of various fruit and vegetable extracts on common potential pathogens including antibiotic-resistant strains. METHODS: Standardized bacterial inocula were added to serial dilutions of sterile vegetable and fruit extracts in broth, with final bacterial concentrations of 10(4-5) cells/mL. After overnight incubation at 35 degrees C, antibacterial activity was measured by minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal dilutions (for raw juices) or concentrations (for tea). RESULTS: Among the vegetable and fruit extracts tested, all green vegetables showed no antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All purple and red vegetable and fruit juices had antibacterial activities in dilutions ranging from 1:2 to 1:16. Garlic juice had significant activity, with bactericidal action in dilutions ranging up to 1:128 of the original juice. Tea also had significant activity, with bactericidal action in concentrations ranging up to 1.6 mg/mL, against a spectrum of pathogens including resistant strains such as methicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: Tea and garlic have the potential for exploration of broader applications as antibacterial agents.
TI  - Validation of the 'Marburg bone bank system' for thermodisinfection of allogenic  femoral head transplants using selected bacteria, fungi, and spores.
AB  - The Marburg Bone Bank System 'Lobator sd-2' is widely used to process human femoral heads removed during aseptic surgery by thermal disinfection. The inactivating capacity of the thermodisinfection system was validated in compliance with current standards using a newly developed femoral head model. The following micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi, taken from the American Type Culture Collection were investigated: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphyloccus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis including spores, Clostridium sporogenes, Mycobacterium terrae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger spores. Highly enriched suspensions of these micro-organisms were applied to the centre of the femoral heads. The reduction in the number of micro-organisms was determined by counting the colony-forming units (cfu) before and after processing the spiked test device in the 'Lobator sd-2' system. Vegetative bacteria, fungi and fungal spores were completely inactivated (reduction factor >/=6 log(10)). The numbers of B. subtilis and C. sporogenes spores, both known to be heat-resistant, were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude. These bacteria serve as a model for spore forming pathogens which are not relevant in femoral heads from living donors. By processing human femoral heads from living donors by thermal disinfection using the Marburg Bone Banking system, a high level of safety is achieved regarding clinically relevant pathogens. To further increase the safety of the thermally treated femoral heads, we recommend that the medical history and present state of the donor, as well as the necessary serological tests should be taken into account.
TI  - Management with closed irrigation for post-sternotomy mediastinitis: experience with the use of electrolyzed strong acid aqueous solution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the adequacy of our treatment strategy for patients with post-sternotomy mediastinitis. METHODS: Between May 1997 and December 2000, 1,045 consecutive adult cardiac operations were performed at our center. Mediastinitis occurred in 8 patients (0.77%) and as treatment, they underwent (1) aggressive debridement, (2) closed irrigation and drainage, and (3) transvenous administration of antibiotics. We irrigated the mediastinum with 0.1-1.0% povidone-iodine solution, alternating with electrolyzed strong acid aqueous solution. We subsequently reviewed the outcome after the closed irrigation treatment for patients with post-sternotomy mediastinitis. RESULTS: In four of the 8 patients, the culture specimen grew Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In the others, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-negative rods were cultured. The mean period between primary surgery and the diagnosis of mediastinitis was 16.3 (8 -57) days. The mean period between diagnosis of mediastinitis and the start of the irrigation treatment was 0.8 (0-3) days. The mean irrigation period was 30.0 (14-47) days. The irrigation complications were mild hepatic dysfunction in 2 patients, hyponatremia in 2 and protracted wound infection in 1. The hospital mortality was 1/8 (12.5%). Seven survivors are free from recurrent mediastinitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of closed irrigation and drainage suggests that it can yield satisfactory results after post-sternotomy mediastinitis, comparable to other reported results with or without muscle flaps.
TI  - Inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  - Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of PEO-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. In this paper, a PEO-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. Subsequently, the presence of a PEO-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. For five bacterial (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus salivarius, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis), adhesion to PEO-brushes was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. The initial deposition rates of Sta. epidermidis, Sta. aureus and Str. salivarius to glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while E. coli and P. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. The initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for C. albicans GB 1/2 and C. tropicalis GB 9/9, respectively. Coating of the glass surface with a PEO-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic P. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. For both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic C. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic C. albicans. The PEO-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. Assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the Lifshitz-Van der Waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. Decreased Lifshitz-van der Waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of multi-drug resistant microorganisms presents a critical problem for patients undergoing surgery. Acidic pH, which is produced by oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC), is a broad-spectrum physiological detriment to survival of microorganisms known to cause surgical infections. The purpose of this study was to examine the antimicrobial effect of ORC against antibiotic-resistant organisms. METHODS: ORC products were challenged with ATCC reference strains and clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and non-resistant ATCC strains of S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Samples of three ORC products (SURGICEL absorbable hemostat, SURGICEL Fibrillar absorbable hemostat, and SURGICEL NU-KNIT absorbable hemostat and identified, respectively, as ORC-R, ORC-F, and ORC-N for this study) were inoculated with challenge organisms in nutrient broth to produce a weight to volume ratio of 15 mg ORC/mL. Plate counts were performed at 0, 1, 6, and 24 h. RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity was seen with all three ORC products against the challenge organisms. Data indicate that antibiotic-resistant microorganisms remain susceptible to the antimicrobial activity of ORC. In testing with nine of 10 bacteria, including four antibiotic-resistant clinical isolates (VRE, MRSA, and PRSP) three-log or greater reductions were seen at 24-h exposure. One ATCC strain of VRE demonstrated some level of resistance to the acidic pH effect. ORC-N showed a three-log reduction with this organism, whereas the reductions with ORC-R and ORC-F were less than one log. CONCLUSION: Since low pH affects a relatively broad-spectrum of bacteria and does not act in a mechanism-specific manner, as do antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria are unlikely to resist the ORC pH effect. Results of this in vitro assessment support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial activity of ORC is effective against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Temporomandibular joint involvement in malignant external otitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to present 6 patients with malignant external otitis (MEO) that resulted in temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement and to discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, and treatment modalities. STUDY DESIGN: All patients diagnosed with MEO between 1994 and 2002 were reviewed for cases in which the TMJ was invaded by the infectious process. Only patients in whom TMJ involvement was documented radiographically and in whom the clinical course was well documented were included in this study. RESULTS: MEO was diagnosed in 42 patients over an 8-year period; TMJ involvement was recorded in 6 patients (14%). The medical history revealed controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus in 4 of the 6 patients. All patients reported early ear symptoms, mainly otalgia and otorrhea. Local signs included an ear canal filled with granulation material, edematous overlying skin, and sensitivity to palpation. Cultures taken from the external ear were positive for either Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, or Proteus mirabilis. TMJ symptoms developed between 1 and 5 months after admission and included painful periauricular swelling and trismus. In 3 patients, healing was uneventful; 3 also died of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: TMJ involvement in MEO is associated with a resistant disease process, often with several recurrences. Prolonged administration of antibiotics is the treatment of choice. Surgical debridement of the TMJ is necessary for the positive identification of the pathogenic organism, in cases of abscess formation, or when osteomyelitic bone destruction of the condyle and glenoid fossa develop.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some 2- and 3-pyridinyl-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, ZnII, and AgI complexes.
AB  - 2-(2-Pyridinyl)- (LI), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)- (LII), 2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-(LIII), 2-(3-pyridinyl)- (LIV), 2-(3-pyridinyl)-5-methyl-1H-benzimidazoles (LV) and their complexes with Fe(NO3)3, Cu(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and AgNO3 were synthesized and antibacterial activity of the compounds was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans. The methyl groups of LIII increase the antimicrobial activity. The AgI complexes have considerable activity toward the microorganisms. Some ZnII complexes show an antimicrobial effect against S. aureus and S. flexneri, although the ligands themselves have no effect. CuII complexes have a considerable antibacterial effect to S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - [Prostate histopathology of NIH category IV prostatitis detected by sextant prostate needle biopsy from the patients with high prostatic specific antigen].
AB  - Asymptomatic prostatitis is classified as category IV in NIH classification of prostatitis syndrome (1999). No report concerning this category has been present. We investigated this category histopathologically and clinically, in order to clarify the histopathological distribution and its correlation to the clinical features, in this study. Among 785 patients who were suspected prostate cancer because of their high prostatic specific antigen (PSA) values and to have a sextant prostate needle biopsy was performed between January, 1996 and December, 2000, 88 patients (11.2%) were diagnosed as NIH category IV prostatitis (asymptomatic prostatitis). We observed all pathological specimens stained with Hematoxylin-Eosine, and classified them into subtypes according to the classification criteria for prostatitis defined by True et al. (1999). We also investigated the relationship between histopathological distribution and clinical features such as PSA values, PSA density, the incidence of pyuria or bacteriuria. In the histopathological study, grade distributions were 12.5% (11/88) in mild, 71.6% (63/88) in moderate, and 15.9% (14/88) in severe. Location distributions were 2.3% (2/88) in glandular, 68.2% (60/88) in periglandular, and 29.5% (26/88) in stromal. No relationship between these subtypes and clinical features was recognized statistically. However, 7 patients (7.95%) were diagnosed as prostate cancers, later. Pyuria was found in 29.1% (23/79). Bacteriuria was present in 14.3% (11/77). Isolated bacteria were 4 strains of Enterococcus faccalis, 2 strains of each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, and one strain of each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Gram positive rod, and Candida sp. No relationship between these subtypes and bacterial species was recognized. These results indicated that the incidence of NIII category IV prostatits was not low without correlation to any clinical features. However, we should pay attention to the presence of prostate cancer, because a small number of the patients were diagnosed as prostate cancer, later.
TI  - Essential oil analysis and antimicrobial activity of eight Stachys species from Greece.
AB  - The volatile composition of eight Stachys species has been studied. The investigated taxa were St. alopecuros (L.) Bentham., St. scardica (Griseb.) Hayek, St. cretica L. ssp. cretica, St. germanica L. ssp. heldreichii (Boiss.) Hayek, St. recta L., St. spinulosa L., St. euboica Rech. and St. menthifolia Vis., growing wild in Greece. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger-type apparatus, and their analyses were performed by GC and GC-MS. Identification of the substances was made by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices with literature records. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were shown to be the main group of constituents of all taxa. Furthermore, the obtained essential oils were tested against the following six bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35210), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 10907), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 2228), as well as against the following five fungi: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Penicillium ochrochloron (ATCC 9112), Epidermophyton floccosum (clinical isolates), Candida albicans (clinical isolates) and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (clinical isolates). The tested essential oils showed better activity against bacterial species than against fungi. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most resistant strain, as none of the essential oils was active against this strain. The essential oil of St. scardica has been proven most active against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Long-term (6-year) effect of selective digestive decontamination on antimicrobial resistance in intensive care, multiple-trauma patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether selective digestive decontamination (SDD) had some negative impact on the bacterial resistance observed in strains isolated from samples from patients receiving nonabsorbable antibiotics and cefazolin. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a university tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: Over a 6-yr period, 360 multiple trauma patients (case patients) submitted to SDD were compared with 360 patients not receiving SDD (controls). INTERVENTIONS: SDD consisted of polymyxin E, gentamicin, and amphotericin B and was applied on the buccal mucosa and provided in the nares and the stomach. For the first 3 days, systemic cefazolin (1 g three times a day) was provided. Resistance analysis was performed in case patients and controls on samples collected at predetermined intervals. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: SDD was used in a small subset of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (360 of 5987 over the 6-yr study period). A relative overgrowth of gram-positive cocci was observed. Methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis was increased (SDD 76%, controls 63%, p <.05) but not that of Staphylococcus aureus (SDD 20%, controls 18%). Resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter to beta-lactamines and aminoglycosides was the same in SDD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: When used in a small subset of patients who have been shown to derive benefit from it (patients who have experienced multiple trauma), SDD has a moderate impact on microbial ecology. However, surveillance cultures are indispensable because the absence of resistance to SDD antibiotics determines the long-term safety of the SDD prophylaxis.
TI  - Risk factors for the development of bacterial infections in multiple myeloma treated with two different vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone schedules.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We evaluated bacterial infections (BIs) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with two different schedules of vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone (VAD). DESIGN AND METHODS: Ninety-seven patients were studied during 340 VAD cycles. VAD was given by either continuous intravenous infusion (CII) to hospitalized patients or rapid intravenous infusion (RII) to outpatients. The characteristics of patients and VAD schedules were retrospectively analyzed to detect correlations with the incidence of BI. RESULTS: By analyzing each VAD cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.06) and post-treatment neutropenia (p=0.08) were associated with a trend for a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with BI risk at both univariate (p<0.02) and multivariate (p<0.002) analyses. Evaluating only the first 4 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of BI than the later period (p<0.0001), previously untreated disease was significantly correlated with BI risk (p<0.04), while male sex (p=0.06), CII schedule (p=0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p=0.1) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection; however, at multivariate analysis the latter two parameters independently predicted BI probability (p<0.015 and p<0.03, respectively) as did previously untreated disease (p<0.025). The high probability of CII-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive VAD as first line treatment are at a major risk of BI up to the completion of the fourth month of therapy. In this setting hospitalization should be avoided and, if patients require admission, antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins could be appropriate and effective.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from invasive species of the Azores, Hedychium gardnerianum and Pittosporum undulatum.
AB  - The compositions of the essential oils from the leaves and flowers of Hedychium gardnerianum and from the leaves of Pittosporum undulatum growing on San Miguel Island (Azores) were investigated, and the compounds were identified by GC-MS analyses. The oils in the leaves and flowers of H. gardnerianum were rich in alpha-pinene, beta-pinene and alpha-cadinol, whereas that from P. undulatum was found to contain monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and alkanes, of which the sesquiterpenes, calamenene (41.4%), farnesol (10.9%), spathulenol (5.6%) and beta-selinene (5.2%) and the diterpene (8beta,13beta)-kaur-16-ene (10.7%) were the major components. Their potential antimicrobial activities were tested against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those with the highest activities against S. aureus and S. epidermis were from H. gardnerianum; none had activity against P. aeruginosa. Additionally, the essential oils from Pittosporum undulatum had good antithrombin activity whereas that from H. gardnerianum did not.
TI  - Effects on adhesiveness and hydrophobicity of sub-inhibitory concentrations of netilmicin.
AB  - The effect of sub-inhibitory concentrations (SICs) of netilmicin on bacterial hydrophobicity and adhesiveness to conjunctival cells was investigated. One strain each of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis was investigated for its susceptibility to netilmicin, its adherence to conjunctival cells and to the effect of hydrocarbon hexadecane before and after treatment with SIC of netilmicin. All of the bacteria tested were susceptible to netilmicin except for Pseudomonas spp. which showed intermediate resistance. Netilmicin-treated Pseudomonas strains exhibited a lower level of hydrophobicity towards n-hexadecane compared with non-treated strains, while netilmicin-treated S. epidermidis and S. aureus showed a slight increase of hydrophobicity. Adherence of the two Pseudomonas strains to conjunctival cells was significantly reduced after growth in the presence of netilmicin, while the adherence of the two staphylococci was only slightly reduced.
TI  - A comparison of the bacteria found on the hands of 'homemakers' and neonatal intensive care unit nurses.
AB  - This prevalence study was conducted to compare the counts, types and antimicrobial resistance profiles of bacterial flora on the hands of individuals in the community to that of nurses at a nearby university teaching hospital, with an intense hand hygiene regimen. Hand cultures were obtained from 204 individuals during a home visit and 119 nurses in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The mean total log counts of organisms were 5.73 and 5.24 for the homemakers [defined as the person (usually the mother) who is the primary person responsible for arranging childcare, cooking, cleaning etc] and nurse hands, respectively (P<0.0001). Significantly more homemakers had Acinetobacter lwoffii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens/putida, and Staphylococcus aureus on their hands compared with the nurses (all P<0.05). However, significantly more nurses had Enterococcus faecalis, S. epidermidis, and S. warneri on their hands (P<0.05). Of note, the hands of nurses harboured significantly more S. epidermidis strains resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and oxacillin and S. warneri resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, clindamycin, and oxacillin (P<0.05). Surprisingly, significantly more trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant S. epidermidis and ciprofloxacin-resistant S. warneri was recovered from the hands of homemakers (P<0.05). This study demonstrates differences in prevalence, bacterial composition and antimicrobial resistance of hand flora of hospital personnel compared with homemakers. Moreover, the hands of homemakers may serve as community reservoirs for antimicrobial resistant strains of clinical importance.
TI  - Comparison of microbial adherence to antiseptic and antibiotic central venous catheters using a novel agar subcutaneous infection model.
AB  - An agar subcutaneous infection model (agar model), which simulates the rat subcutaneous infection model (rat model), was developed to assess the ability of antimicrobial catheters to resist microbial colonization. The catheters were implanted in the agar and rat models and the insertion sites were infected immediately or on day 7, 14 or 21 post-implantation. The catheters implanted in the agar model were transferred to fresh media one day before infection on day 7, 14 or 21. The efficacy of chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine impregnated (CS) catheters, CS catheters with higher levels of chlorhexidine (CS+ catheters), minocycline-rifampicin (MR) catheters and silver catheters against Staphylococcus aureus and rifampicin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis RIF-r2 was compared in the agar and rat models. No significant difference in the adherence or the drug release was found between the in vitro and in vivo models. In both models, CS+ and MR catheters were effective against S. aureus even when infected on day 14, whereas CS catheters were colonized when challenged on day 7. CS+ catheters were effective against S. epidermidis RIF-r2, whereas MR catheters showed adherence when infected on day 7. CS+ catheters prevented colonization of all the organisms including, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans in the agar model, whereas MR catheters were effective only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis strains. Silver catheters were ineffective against all the organisms. The agar model may be used to predict the in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters against various pathogens.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy of urinary catheters impregnated with antiseptics in an in vitro urinary tract model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of urinary Foley catheters (latex  and silicone) impregnated with (1) chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CXS) and (2) chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan (CXST) in inhibiting extra-luminal bacterial adherence and to compare their efficacy with that of silver hydrogel latex (SH) and nitrofurazone-treated silicone (NF) catheters. DESIGN: The antimicrobial spectrum of these catheters was evaluated using a zone of inhibition assay. A novel in vitro urinary tract model was developed to study the potential in vivo efficacy of antimicrobial catheters in preventing extraluminal bacterial colonization. The "meatus" was inoculated daily with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aerginosa, and Candida albicans. The "bladder" portion of the model was cultured daily to determine bacterial growth. RESULTS: Both CXS and CXST catheters had a broader antimicrobial spectrum than SH and NF catheters. In the in vitro model, CXST latex and silicone catheters exhibited significantly better efficacy (3 to 25days) against uropathogens, compared with CXS (1 to 14 days) and control (0 to 5 days) catheters (P = .01). CXST latex catheters exhibited significantly longer protection against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared with SH catheters (P = .01). CXST silicone catheters resisted colonization with Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis for a significantly longer period (23 to 24 days) than did NF catheters (9 to 11 days) (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Catheters impregnated with synergistic combinations of chlorhexidine, silver sulfadiazine, and triclosan exhibited broad-spectrum, long-term resistance against microbial colonization on their outer surfaces.
TI  - Has cerumen a protective role in recurrent external otitis?
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the bactericidal activity of the cerumen in patients with recurrent otitis externa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerumen samples were collected from 2 groups. Group A (n = 20) consisted of patients with recurrent otitis externa (2 or more acute otitis externa attack in the current year) and group B (n = 30) consisted of cerumen from a healthy population. We examined the bactericidal activity against the common microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus) that encounter the recurrent otitis externa. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the count of S epidermidis was observed in group A (P <.05) and B (P <.01) was observed. A comparison of decreases and increases in the percentages of microorganisms between the groups A and B showed that there was a significant difference only in the count of E coli (P <or=.05). The count of E coli decreased in cerumen suspension in group A, but it increased in the normal population. CONCLUSION: We did not confirm that cerumen from patients with recurrent otitis externa had less bactericidal activity than from a healthy population.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and interference of tobramycin and chloramphenicol on bacterial adhesion to intraocular lenses.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of tobramycin and chloramphenicol were evaluated by  determining minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, group A, group B and group G streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and ciprofloxacin-resistant and -susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by evaluating interference on adhesion of slime producer strains of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to intraocular lens from tobramycin and chloramphenicol pharmaceutical products by scanning electron microscopy. Chloramphenicol was more active against Gram-positive bacteria than was tobramycin, which instead showed higher activity against ciprofloxacin-susceptible P. aeruginosa. Treatment of lenses with the antimicrobial products eradicated the bacterial biofilm, which was already notably reduced after 5 min. This activity was more pronounced for chloramphenicol against S. aureus and for tobramycin against P. aeruginosa. Bacterial adhesion was also significantly reduced when lenses colonized by P. aeruginosa were treated with chloramphenicol, even if they were resistant to this drug. In conclusion, the tested drugs showed marked antibacterial activity, particularly by interfering with bacterial biofilms. The data obtained in this study suggest a specific use of chloramphenicol in topical prophylaxis aimed at avoiding bacterial contaminations. However, further specific in vivo studies are needed to confirm these data.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Ultrasound increases the rate of bacterial cell growth.
AB  - Ultrasound was employed to increase the growth rate of bacterial cells attached to surfaces. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli cells adhered to and grew on a polyethylene surface in the presence of ultrasound. It was found that low-frequency ultrasound (70 kHz) of low acoustic intensity (<2 W/cm(2)) increased the growth rate of the cells compared to growth without ultrasound. However, at high intensity levels, cells were partially removed from the surface. Ultrasound also enhanced planktonic growth of S. epidermidis and other planktonic bacteria. It is hypothesized that ultrasound increases the rate of transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells and increases the rate of transport of waste products away from the cells, thus enhancing their growth.
TI  - A microtiter-plate screening method for biofilm disinfection and removal.
AB  - A quantitative spectrophotometric method was developed to measure the removal and killing efficacy of antibiofilm agents. Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis were grown in 96-well plates, treated with an agent, then stained with either the biomass indicator crystal violet or the respiratory indicator 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride. This rapid screening method is sensitive enough to elucidate concentration-response relationships as well as differences between species responses to treatments. Using these assays, agents can be ranked by their ability to remove or kill biofilm.
TI  - Interactions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis in adhesion to a hydrogel.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial strains with known capability to bind to hydrogel lenses were  examined for their relative capacities to attach irreversibly to a hydrogel contact lens in pure and mixed cultures. METHODS AND RESULTS: Time course studies of adhesion through adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or radiolabel analyses indicated that primary adhesion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to a 37% water-content hydrogel lens was more dense and rapid than that of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Primary adhesion of P. aeruginosa was similar after 5 min and 2 hr, whereas S. epidermidis showed an incremental increase in adhesion over the first 30 min. Sequential challenge of lenses with P. aeruginosa followed by S. epidermidis gave levels of primary adhesion for each species similar to those obtained with single pure cultures. When lenses were challenged with S. epidermidis first, primary adhesion of P. aeruginosa was significantly diminished. Exposures of multiple sets of lenses (n = 4) to a standard inoculum of P. aeruginosa resulted in levels of primary adhesion per lens after 1 hr equivalent to that found for a single lens in 5 min or in 2 hr. CONCLUSION: These data further support that normal biota may be protective for the eye. The data also suggest that under conditions of the primary adhesion-screening test, a limited number of cells of GSU no. 3 (selected phenotype) are involved in adhesion to the hydrogel.
TI  - Molecular comparison of bacterial isolates from blood with strains colonizing pharynx and intestine in immunocompromised patients with sepsis.
AB  - Most causative organisms of sepsis in immunocompromised patients are the same species as those that colonize their own nasopharynx or intestinal tract. To determine whether the strains recovered from blood originate mainly from patients' own flora, isolates from blood and throat and/or stool were investigated by genomic analyses. Surveillance cultures of throat and stool were taken prospectively from cancer patients being treated with intensive chemotherapy followed by haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. In those cases of sepsis in which the isolate from blood was the same species as that from the throat and/or stool, the genomic profiles of the isolates were compared by PFGE. Ten cases of blood culture-positive sepsis were documented in six of 14 subjects during a 2 year period; isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., viridans streptococci and Fusobacterium sp. were recovered from blood. In five of seven cases in which the blood isolate was the same species as that from the throat or stool, the genotypes of the isolates from both sites were identical. In the majority of immunocompromised patients, the causative organisms of bloodstream infections originated mainly from their own flora.
TI  - Wound infections in two health institutions in Ile-Ife, Nigeria: results of a cohort study.
AB  - The control of wound infections is increasingly complicated, yet treatment is not always guided by microbiological diagnosis. To describe the distribution of wound infections and causative agents, a prospective, 6-month cohort study involving 102 outpatients was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital and the Health Center in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Location and type of infected wounds were recorded and bacterial isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques. Almost half (40%) of all infected wounds were attributed to trauma and, in most cases, located on the extremities. Of the 162 bacterial isolates obtained from wound cultures, 39 were monomicrobial and 55 were polymicrobial; no bacterial isolate was obtained in eight cases. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant micro-organism (25%), followed by Escherichia coli (12%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9%). The diversity of micro-organisms and the high incidence of polymicrobic flora in this study give credence to the value of identifying one or more bacterial pathogens from wound cultures. The recognition of causative agents of wound infections can assist wound care practitioners in taking appropriate measures. Continuous dialogue between the microbiology department and wound care practitioners is strongly advised in order to improve treatment outcomes and slow the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Comparative studies on the activity of basil--an essential oil from Ocimum basilicum L.--against multidrug resistant clinical isolates of the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas by using different test methods.
AB  - The essential oil basil is obtained from the aerial parts of Ocimum basilicum L.  After gas chromatographic separation, the following components were identified: linalol (54.95%), methylchavikol (11.98%), methylcinnamat (7.24%) and linolen (0.14%). The activity of basil against multidrug resistant clinical isolates from the genera Staphylococcus, Enterococcus and Pseudomonas has been studied. For this purpose, standard and modified broth macrodilution methods were used and time kill kinetic of basil was studied. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were reported between 0.0030% and 0.0007% (v/v). These concentrations were compared with the inhibitory concentrations (ICs) and the logs of the bacterial counts reduction both obtained by basil diluted in 1% Tween (Tw) 80, saline test solution (STS) and spiritus vini (Sv) 95 degrees instead in a broth. The data, obtained after application of different methods of investigation and validated with membrane filtration, showed a strong inhibitory effect of basil on the test bacteria. The chosen bacteria are widespread and pose serious therapeutic difficulties because of their high level of resistance. For this reason, the results obtained were considered encouraging.
TI  - Comparative in vitro potency of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and four oral agents  against recent North American clinical isolates from a global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was compared with four comparator oral antimicrobial agents; ampicillin, azithromycin, cefuroxime and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole against 4536 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the US and Canada between 1997 and 1999. Based upon Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid was the most active agent against many Gram-positive species and phenotypes including methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin intermediate and macrolide resistant strains and was as active as ampicillin against Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae and viridans streptococci. Against Enterobacteriaceae amoxycillin-clavulanic acid in general, displayed weak activity with only Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris displaying levels of susceptibility above the 90th percentile. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid had significant activity against many species of Gram-negative non-Enterobacteriaceae including Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but negligible activity against Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Amoxycillin-clavulanic acid continues to retain excellent activity against the majority of targeted pathogens despite 20 years of clinical use.
TI  - Epidural catheter colonization is not associated with infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidural anesthesia is one of the most common types of regional anesthesia. Although retrospective reviews suggest that the incidence of infection from short-term epidural catheter use is exceedingly low in patients undergoing surgery, the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection has not been well defined. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial colonization of epidural catheters in adult patients undergoing surgery under epidural anesthesia, as well as the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection. METHODS: A prospective nonrandomized study was conducted over a period of 28 months. The incidence of bacterial contamination after epidural catheterization and the correlation between epidural catheter cultures and infection was investigated for 245 adult ASA I, II patients undergoing surgery under lumbar epidural anesthesia. Catheters were removed when epidural analgesia was no longer required, or if clinical signs of infection or catheter malfunction were present. All epidural catheters were cultured upon withdrawal. RESULTS: Epidural catheters were kept in place for 2.3 +/- 0.2 days (range 0.1-12 days). Bacteriological analysis of the 245 epidural catheters yielded 28% positive cultures. The most prevalent microorganism was Staphylococcus epidermidis (58%). In obstetric operations a frequency of 32% positive cultures was observed. Neither central nervous system nor systemic infections occurred during the study. No correlations were found among the type of surgery, the type of antibiotic administration, the sex or age of the patients, the duration of catheter placement, the maximum body temperature, and the frequency of positive epidural catheter cultures. There was no correlation between epidural catheter colonization and infection. CONCLUSION: The contamination of epidural catheters was found to be independent of the administered antimicrobial agents prior to surgery, the duration of catheter placement, and the presence of fever. Except for perioperative prophylaxis, therapeutic use of antibiotics for short-term epidural catheters is not recommended.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of [2-[2-(N, N-disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)-acylamino] thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters.
AB  - [2-[2-(N, N-Disubstituted thiocarbamoyl-sulfanyl)acylamino ]thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters (3a-x) were synthesized by the reaction of potassium salts of N, N-disubstituted dithiocarbamoic acids with [2-(2-chloroalkanoyl)amino-thiazol-4-yl]acetic acid ethyl esters. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, UV, IR, (1)H-NMR, and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of all the compounds were investigated by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AT CC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153 and Candida albicans ATCC10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds 3a, d, e, f, h, k, w activity against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC: 156 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 78 mg/L, 62.5 mg/L, 312 mg/L, 250 mg/L, respectively), compound 3d had some activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 156 mg/L) and C. albicans ATCC 10231(MIC: 156 mg/L). Compounds 3l, 3x also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. The preliminary results indicated that all of the tested compounds were inactive against the test organism.
TI  - Intraventricular and Intravenous Tobramycin with Ceftazidime for Ventriculitis Secondary to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The preferred method for shunting cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles is via a  ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial shunt. Unfortunately, infection is a major complication of shunt surgery, which places the patient at risk of intellectual impairment and death. Although the most common causative pathogens are Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, gram-negative bacterial infections have increased over the last three decades. Treatment of Pseudomonas ventriculitis is highly variable, because there are few guidelines for drug selection, administration, and monitoring. We report a case of post-shunt revision Pseudomonas meningitis/ ventriculitis that was successfully treated by the intraventricular adminstration tobramycin in conjunction with intravenous tobramycin and ceftazidime.
TI  - Combined effect of clarithromycin and imipenem/cilastatin against urinary biofilm infection after pyeloplasty.
AB  - The present report concerns a 38-year-old man, who had been treated with pyeloplasty and lithotomy for the improvement of urinary excretion and resolution of a kidney stone. The patient developed a biofilm infection involving Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and had been suffering from recurrent acute pyelonephritis for one year. Combination therapy with clarithromycin (CAM) and imipenem/cilastatin (IMP/CS) consisted of administration of CAM at a dose of 400 mg/day for 1 week, followed by 500 mg/day of IMP by intravenous infusion combined with CAM (400 mg/day) for 5 days. This therapy produced an immediate antimicrobial effect and no further signs of pyuria have been seen during one year of follow-up in this patient.
TI  - Antibacterial bromophenols from the marine red alga Rhodomela confervoides.
AB  - Two bromophenols, together with three known compounds, were isolated from the methanolic extract of the marine alga, Rhodomela confervoides. By means of MS and NMR spectroscopic analyses, they were identified as 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5-(hydroxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (1) and 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5- (ethoxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (2). Three known compounds were also isolated, namely 3-bromo-4-[2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxyphenyl] methyl-5-(methoxymethyl) 1,2-benzenediol (3), 4,4'- methylenebis [5,6-dibromo-1,2-benzenediol] (4) and bis (2,3-dibromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzyl) ether (5). Compound 5 was the most active against five strains of bacteria with the MIC less than 70 microg/ml, while compounds 2, 3 and 4 exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of S-3578, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of S-3578, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against clinical isolates was evaluated. The MICs of the drug at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited were 4 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 2 micro g/ml for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, which were fourfold higher than and equal to those of vancomycin, respectively. The anti-MRSA activity of S-3578 was considered to be due to its high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 2a (50% inhibitory concentration, 4.5 micro g/ml). In time-kill studies with 10 strains each of MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, S-3578 caused more than a 4-log(10) decrease of viable cells on the average at twice the MIC after 24 h of exposure, indicating that it had potent bactericidal activity. Furthermore, in population analysis of MRSA strains with heterogeneous or homogeneous resistance to imipenem, no colonies emerged from about 10(9) cells on agar plates containing twice the MIC of S-3578, suggesting the low frequency of emergence of S-3578-resistant strains from MRSA. S-3578 was also highly active against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), with a MIC(90) of 1 micro g/ml, which was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. S-3578 also had antibacterial activity against a variety of gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though its activity was not superior to that of cefepime. In conclusion, S-3578 exhibited a broad antibacterial spectrum and, particularly, had excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci and PRSP. Thus, S-3578 was considered to be worthy of further evaluation.
TI  - [Pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
AB  - We contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. The results were that the Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was 43.8% and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was 56.2% in Group A (1985-1990); GPC was 24.6% and GNB was 75.4% in Group B (1995-2000). The predominant bacteria were in the following order: Preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in Group A; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in Group B. The results suggest that GNB is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
TI  - [Study of bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials in vitro].
AB  - This article reports a study of the bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials in vitro. The method for assessing the degree of bacterial adhesion to prosthetic valve materials was established primarily. The capacities of staphylococcus aureus(SA), staphylococcus epidermidis(SE), Escherichia Coli(EC) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PA) for adhesion to Dacron, Pyrolytic carbon and polytetrofluoroethylene (PTFE) were quantitatively determined by the plate counting and Gamma-ray counting of 125I radiolabeled bacteria in vitro. The results showed that the capacities of four types of bacteria for adhesion to Dacron, Pyrolytic carbon and PTFE coincided with the bacterial-growth curve. The capacities of four bacteria for adhering to Dacron were stronger. The adhesion of SE to Pyrolytic carbon was the strongest. The adhesion of PA Kept up a high level. The capacities of EC and PA for adhering to PTFE were the strongest. The results indicate that the capacities of different types of bacteria for adhesion to the same prosthetic valve material are different, and the capacities of one type of bacteria for adhesion to different materials are also different.
TI  - The use of antimicrobial peptides in ophthalmology: an experimental study in corneal preservation and the management of bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial keratitis is an ocular infection with the potential to cause significant visual impairment. Increasing patterns of antibiotic resistance have necessitated the development of new antimicrobial agents for use in bacterial keratitis and other serious ocular infections. With a view to exploring the use of novel antimicrobial peptides in the management of ocular infection, we performed a series of experiments using synthetic antimicrobial peptides designed for the eradication of common and serious ophthalmic pathogens. METHODS: Experiments were performed with three clinical ocular isolates--Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis--in three experimental settings: (1) in vitro in a controlled system of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, (2) in vitro in modified chondroitin sulfate-based corneal preservation media (Optisol), and (3) in an in vivo animal model (rabbit) simulating bacterial keratitis. In all cases, outcomes were measured by quantitative microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The candidate peptides (CCI A, B, and C and COL-1) produced a total reduction of the test pathogens in phosphate buffered saline. In modified Optisol, the peptides were effective against S epidermidis at all temperatures, demonstrated augmented activity at 23 degrees C against the gram-positive organisms, but were ineffective against P aeruginosa. The addition of EDTA to the medium augmented the killing of P aeruginosa but made no difference in the reduction of gram-positive organisms. In an in vivo rabbit model of Pseudomonas keratitis, COL-1 demonstrated neither clinical nor microbicidal efficacy and appeared to have a very narrow dosage range, outside of which it appeared to be toxic to the ocular surface. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the antimicrobial peptides we tested were effective in vitro but not in vivo. In an age of increasing antibiotic resistance, antimicrobial peptides, developed over millions of years as innate defense mechanisms by plants and animals, may have significant potential for development as topical agents for the management of severe bacterial keratitis. However, modifications of the peptides, the drug delivery systems, or both, will be necessary for effective clinical application.
TI  - Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in vitro activities against 4,003 clinical bacterial isolates collected in 24 Italian laboratories.
AB  - Levofloxacin showed comparable in vitro susceptibility to ciprofloxacin among Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus, while greater susceptibility was observed in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus epidermidis, mainly when oxacillin resistant. The susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to levofloxacin reached 99%.
TI  - A comparative study of carboxyfluorescein diacetate and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester as indicators of bacterial activity.
AB  - Staining bacteria with esterified fluorogenic substrates followed by flow cytometric analysis offers a means for rapid detection of metabolically active bacteria. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to assess carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA/SE) as indicators of bacterial activity for cultured bacteria, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and bacteria from environmental waters. In theory, CFDA/SE should be a better indicator of metabolic bacterial activity compared to CFDA due to greater intracellular retention of the fluorescent product. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of exponential phase cultures, mixtures of active and inactive cells and bacteria from environmental waters revealed CFDA was successful in detecting active bacteria, whereas CFDA/SE was not. CFDA/SE labelled inactive cells with intensities equal to that of the active population and could not even discriminate between bacteria in exponential phase growth and a fixed cell preparation. We propose that the specific mode of action of the succinimidyl ester (SE) group in combination with the nonenzymatic aqueous hydrolysis of the CFDA moiety results in the nonspecific labelling of all cells, irrespective of their metabolic state. This study shows that CFDA/SE is a poor marker of bacterial activity.
TI  - Prevalence and drug susceptibility of pathogens causing bloodstream infections in northern Italy: a two-year study in 16 hospitals.
AB  - The epidemiology of bacterial pathogens causing bloodstream infection was studied in 16 hospitals in Lombardy (northern Italy) over a 2-year period (1999 and 2000). Overall, 2924 microorganisms causing significant bacteremia were collected. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli ( n=663; 22.7%), Staphylococcus aureus ( n=534; 18.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis ( n=242; 8.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( n=176; 6.0%). Unlike Escherichia coli, which was usually acquired from the community, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were usually acquired in hospitals. Rates of resistance to oxacillin and its associated traits were significantly higher among hospital-acquired staphylococci as compared to those of isolates from the community. Escherichia coli was highly susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with a very low percentage of strains producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). On the contrary, production of ESBL appeared to be an important mechanism of resistance among nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was widespread in several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, with rates often exceeding 10%. Moreover, with regard to ciprofloxacin, there were no significant differences between rates of resistance among Enterobacteriaceae causing hospital-acquired infections versus those causing community-acquired infections. Multidrug resistance was commonly observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the need for new antimicrobial agents that are more active against nonfermentative gram-negative bacteria. In conclusion, epidemiological studies of the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of blood isolates in northern Italy appear to provide useful information for both empirical treatment of suspected infections and better management of patients.
TI  - Keratinocyte expression of human beta defensin 2 following bacterial infection: role in cutaneous host defense.
AB  - Human beta defensin 2 (hbetaD-2) is thought to play an important role in cutaneous immune defense. We hypothesized that (i) keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2, measured by reverse transcription-PCR, would be upregulated in response to challenge with pathogenic bacteria, particularly highly adherent strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and (ii) hbetaD-2 would have potent antimicrobial activity against pathogenic but not commensal organisms. Expression of hbetaD-2 was induced consistently by S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas strains of S. pyogenes were poor and variable inducers of hbetaD-2. No correlation was found between levels of bacterial adherence and keratinocyte expression of hbetaD-2. S. pyogenes was significantly more sensitive to killing by hbetaD-2 than S. epidermidis. We conclude that the ability to induce hbetaD-2 expression in combination with sensitivity to its antimicrobial effects may contribute to the rarity of skin infections with the gram-negative bacterial organisms, whereas lack of stimulation of hbetaD-2 expression by S. pyogenes may be important in its ability to evade innate defenses and cause skin disease. Induction of expression of hbetaD-2 but relative tolerance to it may enable S. epidermidis to survive on the skin surface and modulate hbetaD-2 expression when the stratum corneum barrier is disrupted.
TI  - Subdural Empyema.
AB  - Subdural empyema represents loculated infection between the outermost layer of the meninges, the dura, and the arachnoid. The empyema may develop intracranially or in the spinal canal. Intracranial subdural empyema is most frequently a complication of sinusitis or, less frequently, otitis or neurosurgical procedures. Spinal subdural empyema is rare and may result from hematogenous infection or spread of infection from osteomyelitis. The most common organisms in intracranial subdural empyema are anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci, in particular those of the Streptococcus milleri group (S. milleri and Streptococcus anginosus). Staphylococcus aureus is present in a minority of cases, and multiple additional organisms, including Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, and anaerobic organisms, such as Bacteroides, may be present. Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis may be present in cases related to neurosurgical procedures, and Salmonella species have been detected in patients with advanced AIDS; multiple organisms may be present simultaneously. Spinal subdural empyemas are almost invariably caused by streptococci or by S. aureus. Subdural empyema--whether it occurs in the skull or the spinal canal--may cause rapid compression of the brain or spinal cord, and represents an extreme medical and neurosurgical emergency. The diagnostic procedure of choice for intracranial and spinal subdural empyema is MRI with gadolinium enhancement. Computed tomography scan may miss intracranial subdural empyemas detectable by MRI. Conversely, occasion spinal subdural empyemas may be detected by CT myelography where MRI is negative. Treatment in virtually all cases of intracranial or spinal subdural empyema requires prompt surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. Pus from the empyema should always be sent for anaerobic, as well as aerobic, culture. Because intracranial subdural empyemas may contain multiple organisms, provisional antibiotic therapy of intracranial subdural empyema, where the organism is unknown, should be directed against S. aureus, microaerophilic and anaerobic streptococci, and Gram-negative organisms. Antibiotics should include 1) nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin; plus 2) a third generation cephalosporin; plus 3) metronidazole. Provisional antibiotic therapy of spinal subdural empyemas should be directed against S. aureus and streptococci, and should include nafcillin, oxacillin, or vancomycin. Morbidity and mortality in intracranial and spinal subdural empyema relate directly to the delay in institution of therapy. Both conditions should, thus, be treated with great urgency.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria and analysis of their sensibility to antibiotics in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was explore the distribution of the bacteria and their sensibility to antibiotics in hospital-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-six bacterium species were collected in patients with the hospital-acquired pneumonia to make sputum culture. The sensibility of the bacteria to antibiotics were examined by KB paper method and the minimal-inhibitory-concentration by gel double multiple dilute method. RESULTS: Most of the G- bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%) and klebsiella bacillus (22%). Most of the G+ bacteria were staphylococcus epidermidis (14%) and staphylococcus aureus (12%). G- bacteria were sensitive to impienem(98%), cefoperazone(90%), ceftriaxone(90%), leftazidime(92%), ciprofloxacin(90%), and amikacin(89%). The sensibility of vancomycin to G+ bacteria was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella bacillus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus aureus are the most important bacteria in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Imipenem, cefoperazone, ceftriazone, leftazidime, ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and vancomycin are effective antibiotics for treating hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on methanol extract of benincasa hispida cogn., fruit.
AB  - The methanol extract of wax gourd, the fruits of Benincasa hispida cogn.(Cucurbitaceae) was found to show no inhibition against three gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus subtilis and three gram negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia by cup-plate method whereas antifungal studies showed significant inhibition against Candida albicans in the concentration of 30 mg/ml and there was no inhibition against Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII complexes of 2-(2-hydroxy-5-bromo/nitro-phenyl)-1H- and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-methyl/chloro/nitro-1H-benzimidazoles.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-R5-1H-benzimidazoles, 2-(2-hydroxy-5-R5'-phenyl)-1H-benzimidazoles and their FeIII, CuII, AgI, ZnII and HgII nitrate complexes was tested toward Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus mirabilis. Antifungal activity was tested against Candida albicans. Benzimidazole benzene ring substituents increase the antimicrobial activity, phenol ring substituents decrease it. The ligands show an antibacterial effect against only S. aureus whereas AgI and HgII complexes of the ligands have a higher activity with respect to the other complexes to all the bacteria. On the other hand, FeIII complexes show a considerable activity against S. aureus and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Physicochemical characterization and antimicrobial properties of rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2 NCBIM 40044.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa 47T2, grown in submerged culture with waste frying oil as  a carbon source, produced a mixture of rhamnolipids with surface activity. Up to 11 rhamnolipid homologs (Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(8)/Rha-C(8)-C(10);Rha-Rha-C(8)-C(12:1); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12:1); Rha-C(10)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-Rha-C(12)-C(10); Rha-C(10)-C(12:1)/Rha-C(12:1)-C(10); Rha-Rha-C(12:1)-C(12); Rha-Rha-C(10)-C(14:1); Rha-C(10)-C(12)/Rha-C(12)-C(10)) were isolated from cultures of P. aeruginosa 47T2 from waste frying oil and identified by HPLC-MS analysis. This article deals with the production, isolation, and chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid mixture RL(47T2). The physicochemical and biological properties of RL(47T2) as a new product were also studied. Its surface tension decreased to 32.8 mN/m; and the interfacial tension against kerosene to 1 mN/m. The critical micellar concentration for RL(47T2) was 108.8 mg/mL. The product showed excellent antimicrobial properties. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated according to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits development of visible microbial growth. Low MIC values were found for bacteria Serratia marcescens (4 microg/mL), Enterobacter aerogenes (8 microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.5 microg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (32 microg/mL), Bacillus subtilis (16 microg/mL), and phytopathogenic fungal species: Chaetonium globosum (64 microg/mL), Penicillium funiculosum (16 microg/mL), Gliocadium virens (32 microg/mL) and Fusarium solani (75 microg/mL).
TI  - Superior antimicrobial activity of trisodium citrate over heparin for catheter locking.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis catheters used for vascular access are frequently complicated by infection and catheter-related thrombosis. Improvement of interdialytic locking solutions could reduce these problems. Trisodium citrate (TSC) has been advocated in recent years because it might have antimicrobial qualities. METHODS: Antimicrobial efficacy of four concentrations of TSC (2.2, 7.5, 15 and 30%) was compared with three equi-osmolal sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations, unfractionated heparin 5000 IU/ml and a solution of gentamicin 1 mg/ml in TSC 7.5%. We analysed antimicrobial properties by two classical in vitro susceptibility tests. All tests were performed in triplicate by incubation of test fluids with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. RESULTS: Increasing TSC concentrations effectively killed the staphylococcal strains in both assays. For E.coli and P.aeruginosa complete killing was achieved only with TSC 30%. TSC 30% was also the only solution that significantly inhibited growth of C.albicans. Heparin manifested no antimicrobial effect of any significance. Adding gentamicin to TSC provided superior bacterial growth inhibition but had no effect on yeast growth. TSC solutions manifested superior antimicrobial activity compared with iso-osmolal NaCl solutions in both assays. CONCLUSION: This in vitro study demonstrates superior antimicrobial activity of TSC, especially in higher concentrations, in contrast to heparin. The mechanism seems to differ from hyperosmolality. Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) chelating effects are probably more important. Adding gentamicin provided the most potent antimicrobial solution. However, for reasons concerning development of bacterial resistance and sensitization of the patient, continuous exposition to aminoglycosides seems not advisable.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of prophylactic treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). About 80% of patients experience fever during aplasia and early engraftment despite oral antibacterial chemoprophylaxis. METHODS: In a pilot study, 50 patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT received a prophylactic antibacterial treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam beginning on day of stem cell or bone marrow transfusion. They were analyzed retrospectively for frequencies of fever of unknown origin (FUO), documented infection, bacteremia and death because of infection. Furthermore, data from microbiological monitoring and tolerability were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 28 autologous transplanted patients, 10 (36%) developed fever more than 38.5 degrees C; 9/10 FUO, 1/28 pulmonary infiltrates. Eighteen patients (64%) remained without any symptom of infection. In the allogeneic group (n = 22), there were eight patients (36%) with FUO, and five patients (23%) with documented infections (pneumonia 2, enteritis 1, pyelonephritis 1, Escherichia coli bacteremia 1). In nine patients (41%), escalation of antimicrobial treatment was not necessary. The majority of detected microbes in cultures of throat and nose secretions, blood, urine and stool were gram-positive bacteria (77.8%), among them Staphylococcus epidermidis (23.5%), streptococci (group A, B, C; 21.0%) and enterococci (10.6%). Incidence of gram-negative bacteria and fungi was similar with 11.8% and 10.4%, respectively. The most frequent gram-negative strains were Escherichia coli (6.5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.7%). There was no severe toxicity or hypersensitivity. CONCLUSION: Compared to oral decontamination and chemoprophylaxis, an intravenous prophylactic regimen as described above could be an effective and well-tolerated approach in prevention of bacterial infections and related complications, with a higher acceptance in recipients of bone marrow or stems cell grafts. Further evaluation in comparison with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis regarding efficacy, development of resistances as well as cost-benefit analyses is warranted.
TI  - [Survey on drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in common pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain primary knowledge of drug resistance to ciprofloxacin in the common pathogenic bacteria in this hospital thereby to bring the situation under control. METHODS: A total of 3 800 strains of pathogenic bacteria were isolated from in-patients from 1997 to 2000, and drug resistance of these strains to ciprofloxacin was examined. RESULTS: During the past 4 years, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were found to be highly resistant to ciprofloxacin with the rates still on the rise from 50%, 25.6% and 40.3% in 1997 to 62.2%, 53.4% and 63.6% respectively in 2000. Over 40% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter were resistant to ciprofloxacin and the percentages for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter reached 31.1% to 34.0% in 2000. Among the 189 strains of the pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with sustained infection in our hospital in 2000, over 70% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis were identified as having resistance to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The percentages of common pathogenic bacteria that are resistant to ciprofloxacin have been considerably high and tend to increase further. Ciprofloxacin abuse needs to be given appropriate attention.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2000). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 institutions in Japan were supplied between the period of August 2000 and July 2001. Then, the susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. The number of them were 511 strains. The breakdown of these strains was Gram-positive bacteria as 29.0% and Gram-negative bacteria as 71.0%. Susceptibilities of these bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as follows; vancomycin (VCM), ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis. No increase in low-susceptible strains of E. faecalis observed against these antimicrobial agents. VCM showed a strong activity against MRSA preventing growth of all strains with 1 microgram/ml. In addition, the activity of arbekacin (ABK) was strong with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml against MRSA and prevented growth of all strains with 4 micrograms/ml. ABK showed a strong activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis preventing growth of all strains with 0.5 microgram/ml. ABPC, cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) also showed a relatively strong activity against S. epidermidis (MIC90: 4 to 8 micrograms/ml). Against Escherichia coli, carbapenems showed high activities: meropenem (MEPM) prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml; IPM prevented growth of all strains with 0.25 microgram/ml. CZOP and CTM also showed strong activities against E. coli: MIC90 of CZOP was within 0.125 microgram/ml; MIC80 and MIC90 of CTM were 0.25 and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively. Quinolone resistant E. coli was detected at frequency of 14.0%, which was significantly higher than that in the last year. Almost all drugs showed strong activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and MEPM prevented growth of all strains within 0.125 microgram/ml. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, almost drugs were not so active. The MIC90 of carbapenems and gentamicin (GM) were 16 micrograms/ml and those of all other drugs were more than 32 micrograms/ml. Against Serratia marcescens, the MIC90 of IPM and GM were the lowest value being 2 micrograms/ml, and that of MEPM was 4 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Biofilm formation on tracheostomy tubes.
AB  - An increased awareness of biofilms and their mechanisms has led to a better understanding of bacterial infections that occur following the placement of tracheostomy tubes and other implanted devices and prostheses. One aspect of biofilm formation that is still subject to debate is whether the specific material that is used to manufacture a tube has any bearing in the incidence of infection. We conducted a test of four different tube materials--polyvinyl chloride, silicone, stainless steel, and sterling silver--to ascertain how bacterial biofilms form on tracheostomy tubes and to determine if there is a material-dependent difference in biofilm formation. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis both formed bacterial biofilms on tracheostomy tubes in vitro. We also found that there was no difference in susceptibility to biofilm formation among the four tube materials tested.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of meropenem and ciprofloxacin in the presence of 5-fluorouracil.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of meropenem and ciprofloxacin was studied in the presence of the antineoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether the PAEs of the combinations differed from the PAEs of the antibiotics alone. METHODS: The PAEs of the combinations of 5-FU plus meropenem or ciprofloxacin were determined with viable counts against four reference strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and two clinical isolates of S. epidermidis. The results were compared with the PAEs of the antibiotics drugs and 5-FU alone. The gram-positive strains were tested for slime production, both alone and in the presence of 5-FU. RESULTS: Against two of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis, the combination of ciprofloxacin and 5-FU gave a synergistic prolongation of the PAE in comparison with the PAEs induced by the drugs alone. The combinations showed indifference against the other bacteria. The combination of meropenem and 5-FU had a synergistic PAE against one of the three tested strains of S. epidermidis and an additive effect against E. coli but showed indifference against the rest of the strains. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of 5-FU did not influence the PAEs of the antibiotics against most of the tested strains, but caused a synergistic prolongation of the PAEs induced by ciprofloxacin and meropenem against some of the tested strains of S. epidermidis. 5-FU inhibited slime production in the same S. epidermidis strains, which might have contributed to the longer PAE.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Bacteria that attach to a surface and grow as a biofilm are protected from killing by antibiotics. Reduced antibiotic susceptibility contributes to the persistence of biofilm infections such as those associated with implanted devices. The protective mechanisms at work in biofilms appear to be distinct from those that are responsible for conventional antibiotic resistance. In biofilms, poor antibiotic penetration, nutrient limitation and slow growth, adaptive stress responses, and formation of persister cells are hypothesized to constitute a multi-layered defense. The genetic and biochemical details of these biofilm defenses are only now beginning to emerge. Each gene and gene product contributing to this resistance may be a target for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. Disabling biofilm resistance may enhance the ability of existing antibiotics to clear infections involving biofilms that are refractory to current treatments.
TI  - The use of surgical facemasks during cataract surgery: is it necessary?
AB  - AIM: To assess whether facemask utilisation by the surgeon during cataract surgery has any effect on the bacterial load falling onto the operative site. METHOD: Prospective randomised masked study. Consent was obtained from 221 patients. Cases were randomised to wearing a new mask or not wearing any mask throughout the procedure. Blood agar settle plates were placed adjacent to the patient's head in the operative field. Duration of procedure was noted. Plates were incubated and read at 48 hours. Colony forming bacteria were counted and identified. RESULTS: There were significantly fewer organisms cultured when the surgeon used a facemask (p=0.0006). The majority of organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus spp, and Diphtheroid spp; however Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured on several occasions. There were no cases of infective complication. CONCLUSIONS: The main purpose of an operating mask is to prevent bacteria falling on to the operative site from the surgeon's oropharynx or nasopharynx with the concomitant theoretical risk of infective complication. Operating masks were shown to have a significant effect on the volume of bacterial organisms falling to the operative site; however, whether this is clinically significant is unknown.
TI  - Microbiology of acute otitis externa.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from acute otitis externa (AOE) and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective core series. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals of subjects with clinically diagnosed acute otitis externa. Species-level identification for each bacterial isolate recovered was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End point mean inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) recommended methods. RESULTS: In Alcon-sponsored clinical studies conducted in 1998 to 2000, microbiology specimens were collected from 2039 subjects (2240 diseased ears) by 101 investigators throughout the United States. A total of 2838 bacteria, 32 yeast, and 17 molds were recovered from 2048 ears clinically diagnosed as acute otitis externa. Of the 202 bacterial species recovered, the species most frequently isolated was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (38%). The next 10 species most frequently isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 9.1%; Staphylococcus aureus, 7.8%; Microbacterium otitidis, 6.6%; Microbacterium alconae, 2.9%; Staphylococcus caprae, 2.6%; Staphylococcus auricularis, 2.0%; Enterococcus faecalis, 1.9%; Enterobacter cloacae, 1.6%; Staphylococcus capitis subsp. Ureolyticus,1.4%; and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 1.3%. Susceptibility profiles of S. epidermidis isolates revealed the greatest frequency of high-level resistance to selected antibiotics (>/=8 microg/mL): 23%, neomycin-resistant; 11%, oxacillin-resistant; and 12%, ofloxacin-resistant. Susceptibility profiles of S. aureus isolates revealed a lower frequency of high-level resistance: 6.3%, neomycin-resistant; 2.7%, oxacillin-resistant; and 4.5%, ofloxacin-resistant. P. aeruginosa with high-level resistance to quinolones (>/=128 mcg/mL for ofloxacin) was recovered from only 1 subject. Likewise, resistance of P. aeruginosa to aminoglycosides was rare. Twenty isolates had neomycin MICs >/=64 mcg/mL and 10 isolates had gentamicin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL. The coryneform isolates identified as Microbacterium otitidis had an intrinsic lack of susceptibility to quinolones (ofloxacin MICs >/=16 mcg/mL) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin MICs >/=32 mcg/mL and gentamicin MICs >/=8 mcg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections of the external ear canal are most often caused by P. aeruginosa. However, there are a great number of other gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial species that are recovered from patients with acute otitis externa. Because of this diverse etiology, the best topical therapeutic choice for topical therapy is for the most potent, broad-spectrum (especially anti-P. aeruginosa) antibiotic available.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against isolates from complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem was measured using 4725 strains isolated from  patients with complicated urinary tract infections (CUTIs) between 1988 and 2000. Imipenem was inactive against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium and some non-fermenting Gram-negative rods. Resistant strains (MIC>16 mg/l) were observed in Staphylococcus haemolyticus (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterococcus avium (8%), Serratia marcescens (5%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Although the prevalence of imipenem-resistant strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa was sporadically high in some years, no steady increase was seen over the period. Resistant strains were rare in other major uropathogenic species. These results suggest that imipenem is still one of the most reliable antimicrobial drugs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the marine alkaloids haminol and pulo'upone and related compounds.
AB  - The marine alkaloids haminol A, haminol B and pulo'upone as well as 17 related compounds (twelve 2-substituted pyridine derivatives, four 3-substituted ones and one analogue of the bicyclic terminus of pulo'upone) were tested for antimicrobial activity against a panel of six microbes (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the paper disc agar diffusion method. Six compounds were tested also against the mold Aspergillus niger. Some of the compounds displayed noteworthy antimicrobial activity, only one congener being completely devoid of activity. Nearly all compounds had activity against B. cereus and S. epidermidis. The growth of E. coli, C albicans and S. cerevisiae was also distinctly inhibited by many compounds. In contrast, most compounds were inactive or had minimal activity against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, most of the compounds tested against the opportunistic pathogen A. niger were active, one of them having noteworthy inhibitory potency.
TI  - Cancer prevention and therapy with kiwifruit in Chinese folklore medicine: a study of kiwifruit extracts.
AB  - Kiwi gold fruits were extracted successively with hexane, acetone, methanol and 70% methanol, and further fractionated by silica gel and ODS column chromatographies for the assays of various biological activities. Five fractions H1, H2 (hexane extract), Al, A2 (acetone extract) and M2 (methanol extract) showed selective cytotoxic activity against human oral tumor cell lines, which was more sensitive than human gingival fibroblasts. More hydrophilic fractions [70M3, 70M4, 70M5] of 70% methanol extract displayed higher anti-HIV activity, radical generation and O2- scavenging activity. The antibacterial activity of 70% methanol extracts [70M0, 70M1, 70M2, 70M3, 70M4] was generally lower than that of more lipophilic fractions (hexane, acetone, methanol extracts), although each fraction did not show any specific antimicrobial action. All fractions were inactive against Helicobacter pylori. These results demonstrate that gold kiwifruit extracts contain valuable, various bioactive materials, which can be separated with each other.
TI  - Remarkable substituent effects on antimicrobial activities of 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium salts.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of a series of 25 diazolidinium  salts, 1,3-diorganylimidazolidinium (1), together with 1,3-dialkylpyrimidinium (2), were evaluated against standard strains: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and Candida albicans (ATCC 10239). Selective and effective antibacterial activity against one gram-negative (P. aeruginosa) and two gram-positive (E. faecalis and S. aureus) bacteria were found in salts 1a, 1i and 1j, in contrast to modest to poor activity observed in the rest of the salts. The enhanced antibacterial activity is clearly linked to the introduction of two bulky mesityl or mesitylbenzyl substituents on the nitrogen atoms of the imidazoline skeleton, while the side chain of the backbone of the molecule has no influence.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological activities of 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 2-substituted-4-methyl-7-amino/4,7-dimethyl-1,8-naphthyridines were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR and elemental analysis. The compounds were investigated for anticonvulsant (125, 250 mg/kg), cardiac and antimicrobial activities. The compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against gram (+) bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcusfaecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and gram (-) bacteria (Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). All the compounds except 2-(3'-phenylaminopropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activity of 2-(3-morpholino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diethanolamino-propyloxy)-4,7-dimethy-1,8-naphthyridine at the dose of 250 mg/kg were found to be equivalent to diazepam (5 mg/kg). Sympathetic blocking activity was observed with 2-(3'-phenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine, 2-(3'-diethanolamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine and 2-(3'-diphenylamino-2'-hydroxypropyloxy)-4-methyl-7-amino-1,8-naphthyridine only. All the compounds were devoid of antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria.
TI  - The effect of apo-transferrin on bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
AB  - Apo-transferrin (apo-Tf), the iron deficient form of Tf, has been identified previously as a potent inhibitor of Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion to polyurethane surfaces. In this study, the ability of apo-Tf to suppress the adhesion of two other strains of bacteria, namely a Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and a Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa to several biomaterials, including polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, and silicone, is documented. The presence of apo-Tf in the medium at 20 microg/ml lowered bacterial adhesion to all tested biomaterials more than fourfold. Moreover, apo-Tf exerted its inhibitory activity even when protein coated surfaces were used as substrates for bacterial adhesion. To emphasize the importance of apo-Tf in the prevention of bacterial adhesion, human serum was depleted of Tf, employing affinity chromatography, and was shown to lose its inhibitory activity toward bacterial adhesion. Upon addition of apo-Tf to Tf-depleted serum, the activity was reestablished, resulting in a marked reduction in the number of bacteria adhered to the surfaces. Following the enzymatic deglycosylation, apo-Tf retained its ability to prevent bacterial adhesion. These results indicate that the carbohydrate moiety does not seem to play a role in this activity. The presented data provide the evidence that the inhibitory activity of apo-Tf is not bacterial strain specific and that the presence of apo-Tf in the medium results in a significant reduction of bacterial adhesion to a variety of neat and/or protein coated surfaces.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to titanium-oxy-nitride (TiNOX) coatings with different resistivities: a novel approach for the development of biomaterials.
AB  - In this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different TiNOX coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. Quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an air-liquid interface. S. epidermidis and S. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. P. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. These results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for TiNOX coatings with a specific resistivity. TiNOX coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of S. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. However, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated TiNOX remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. This indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the TiNOX coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.
TI  - [Evaluation of trends in ue of antibiotics and resistance in selected bacterial pathogens].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of antibiotic consumption and the surveillance of bacterial pathogens resistance appears to be an indispensable part of antibiotic policy. The aim of this study was to evaluate dynamics of antibiotics consumption and resistance development in selected bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aueruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) in the environment of Faculty Hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS: The analysis was focused on the development of antibiotic consumption and monitoring of the development of bacterial resistance. Samples were taken in internal and surgical departments of General Faculty Hospital in Prague in 1992, 1995, and 1999. The evaluation of antibiotic consumption was based on Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical classification system and the Defined Daily Doses (DDD). The consumption in the follow up period almost doubled in surgical department while in internal medicine department was decreased by almost one third. In both department, namely in the surgical one significant increase of bacterial resistance of tested antibiotics was noted. CONCLUSION: The important part of the local antibiotic policy is the monitoring of development of bacterial resistance and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of leakage of bacteria and endotoxins in teeth treated endodontically  by two different techniques.
AB  - Root canal recontamination occurs after contact between oral-bacterial flora and  the coronal extremity of the root canal. The aim of this study was to evaluate the time required for endotoxins and bacteria to penetrate through root-canal obturations performed with vertical and lateral gutta-percha condensation techniques. Specimens prepared by the two alternative methods were exposed to contaminated saliva, and leakage into the root was evaluated over time. None of the obturated roots was infiltrated by endotoxins after 31 days. On the contrary, between day 13 and day 37 bacteria had infiltrated all specimens.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution in patients with respiratory tract infection.
AB  - This study evaluated the potential for bacterial contamination of saline nasal spray/drop solution after 3 days of clinical use in patients. Twenty patients with upper respiratory infection used the saline as a spray, and 20 patients used the solution as drops. Bacterial growth was present in 18 (907%) solution containers of the spray group and in 3 (157%) solution containers of the drops group (P <.005). Twenty isolates were recovered from the spray group and 3 from the drops group. The predominate isolates included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha Streptococcus species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus spp. This study demonstrates the contamination of nasal saline-dispensing solution used as a spray with micro-organisms that are part of the normal skin and nasal flora and gram-negative organisms of potential enteric origin. These data support the use of nasal saline-dispensing solution as drops, rather than as spray. They also illustrate the risk for crossinfection if a nasal solution is used by more than 1 patient.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel catheter lock solution.
AB  - Intravascular catheter-associated bloodstream infections significantly increase rates of morbidity and hospital costs. Microbial colonization and development of biofilms, which are known to be recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy, often lead to the loss of otherwise patent vascular access systems. We evaluated a new taurolidine- and citrate-based catheter lock solution (Neutrolin; Biolink Corporation, Norwell, Mass.) for its activity against planktonic microbes, antimicrobial activity in a catheter model, and biofilm eradication activity. In studies of planktonic microbes, after 24 h of contact, 675 mg of taurolidine-citrate solution per liter caused > 99% reductions in the initial counts of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Entercoccus faecalis. A solution of 13,500 mg/liter was cidal for Candida albicans. Ports and attached catheters inoculated with 50 to 600 CFU of these bloodstream isolates per ml were locked with heparin or the taurolidine-citrate solution. After 72 h, there was no growth in the taurolidine-citrate-treated devices but the heparin-treated devices exhibited growth in the range of 6 x 10(2) to 5 x 10(6) CFU/ml. Biofilms were developed on silicone disks in modified Robbins devices with broth containing 6% serum (initial counts, 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/cm(2)). The axenic biofilms were treated for 24 h with taurolidine-citrate or heparin. Taurolidine-citrate exposure resulted in a median reduction of 4.8 logs, whereas heparin treatment resulted in a median reduction of 1.7 logs (P < 0.01). No significant differences in the effects of the two treatments against P. aeruginosa and C. albicans were observed. These findings suggest that taurolidine-citrate is a promising combination agent for the prevention and treatment of intravascular catheter-related infections.
TI  - Prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections in 14 Greek hospitals: planning  from the local to the national surveillance level.
AB  - A prevalence study of hospital-acquired infections (HAI) was carried out in 14 of 112 Greek hospitals (15.7%), scattered throughout Greece. Five of seven Greek university hospitals and nine regional hospitals participated in the one-day study, and 3925 hospitalized patients (10.5% of the total hospital beds in Greece) were recorded. The aim of this project was to organize a surveillance of HAI with the participation of the greatest possible number of Greek hospitals, transferring the experience from the local Cretan infection control network in an effort to create a nationwide network. Special attention was paid to recruit all Greek university hospitals in our attempt to expand the study base. Co-ordination of the participating centres, education of the infection control teams on surveillance methods, preparation of agreed definitions, and elaboration of the protocol for the collection of the data were the major objectives of this study. The difficulties, however, were limited resources and the lack of skilled personnel. The overall prevalence of HAI was found to be 9.3%. The most common HAI recorded involved lower respiratory tract infections (30.3%), followed by urinary tract infections (22.7%), bloodstream infections (15.8%), and surgical site infections (14.8%). The greatest prevalence rate was found in the adult ICU (48.4%), followed by the neonatal ICU (30.3%). The duration of hospitalization, the number of operations, the total number of used devices and invasive procedures were significantly correlated with HAI. Positive cultures were found in 51.5% of the cases. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.6%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7.6%). The administration of antibiotics was also recorded. The prevalence of antibiotic use was 51.4%.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis of nosocomial origin: an epidemiological study from the "Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo".
AB  - A prospective multicenter study was designed to assess the frequency, etiology, and mortality of nosocomial neonatal sepsis diagnosed between 1996 and 1997 in the neonatology services of 27 acute-care hospitals in Spain ("Grupo de Hospitales Castrillo"). Nosocomial sepsis is defined in the literature using chronological criteria (> 3-7 days of life at the onset of symptoms); accordingly, there is the possibility of including late-onset maternally acquired sepsis or of excluding early-onset nosocomial sepsis (< 3-7 days of life). For these reasons, in this study, cases of nosocomial sepsis that developed at < or = 3-7 days after birth (early onset) were also recorded and maternally acquired sepsis diagnosed beyond 3-7 days of life were excluded. Using these criteria in a total of 30,993 admissions to the neonatal units of the participating hospitals, the nosocomial sepsis rate was 2.1% with an incidence density of 0.89 per 1000 patient days. Sepsis rate was significantly more frequent among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (15.6%) than among those weighing > or = 1500 g (1.16%) (P < 0.001). Fifty-eight percent of all isolates were Gram-positive organisms, mainly Staphylococcus epidermidis (42%). Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 29.5% of cases (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were the most commonly isolated pathogens) and fungal infections in 12%, with absolute predominance of Candida spp. The overall mortality rate was 11.8% and the following subgroups had significantly higher (P < 0.001) mortality rates: sepsis caused by Gram-negative organisms (19% vs. 5.1% in Gram-positive pathogens) and sepsis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.3% vs. 9.4% for the total number of sepsis caused by the remaining causative pathogens). Sepsis caused by S. epidermidis showed a significantly lower mortality rate (5.5%) compared with overall sepsis for the remaining etiologies (14.2%) (P < 0.001). In VLBW infants, the mortality rate was significantly higher than in infants weighing > 1500 g (17.3% vs. 6.5%, P < 0.001).
TI  - Antibiotic tolerance of peritoneal bacterial isolates in dialysis fluids.
AB  - The objective was to test antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis  and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in fresh dianeal fluid and spent dialysate from patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. MICs and MBCs were measured and compared with those in standard broth. For S. epidermidis, there was some reduction in cefazolin and vancomycin activity in dialysis fluids. For P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin MICs increased significantly, and all isolates were tolerant to ceftazidime and piperacillin in dialysis fluids. Dialysis fluids can significantly impair antibiotic activity. The clinical implications warrant further study of antibiotic pharmacodynamics in the treatment of peritonitis.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [The variance of pathogenic organisms of purulent ulcerative keratitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the variance of pathogens of purulent keratitis and their  resistance patterns to antibiotics. METHODS: From January 1995 to October 2000, all patients with suspected infectious corneal ulcer were examined by bacterial, fungal and Acanthameoba culture. The results of microorganism-culture were compared with those in literature. RESULTS: Of the specimens in 1 430 cases, there were 790 cases (55.2%) with positive culture including bacterial isolates in 258 cases (18.0%), fungal isolates in 498 cases (34.8%) and parasites in 34 cases (2.4%). The Staphylococcus aureous and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that had markedly declined since 1980s represented 6.2% and 21.7% of bacterial isolates respectively. However, the opportunity organism such as Staphylococcus epidermidis represented 27.5%, a tendency of gradual increase. The most common fungal pathogen was fusarium spp that represented 64.5% of all positive fungal cultures, and Aspergillus spp (13.6%) occupied the second place. The resistance of the ocular bacteria to fluoroquinolones gradually increased. Although the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to gentamycin in 36.2%, it was almost no resistance to tobramycin (3.4%). The fusarium spp was shown to be resistant to a number of the anti-fungal agents, but it is sensitive to natamycin. CONCLUSION: The survey of pathogens in purulent ulcerative keratitis and their resistance patterns to antibiotics helps in clinical treatment.
TI  - Diterpenoids from Salvia ceratophylla.
AB  - Salvia ceratophylla L. has yielded four known and two new diterpenoids together with two triterpenic acids, a steroid and a flavone. The structures of the compounds were established by spectroscopic analyses. One of the known compounds candidissiol exhibited a high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion: seen any good biofilms lately?
AB  - The process of surface adhesion and biofilm development is a survival strategy employed by virtually all bacteria and refined over millions of years. This process is designed to anchor microorganisms in a nutritionally advantageous environment and to permit their escape to greener pastures when essential growth factors have been exhausted. Bacterial attachment to a surface can be divided into several distinct phases, including primary and reversible adhesion, secondary and irreversible adhesion, and biofilm formation. Each of these phases is ultimately controlled by the expression of one or more gene products. Ultrastructurally, the mature bacterial biofilm resembles an underwater coral reef containing pyramidal or mushroom-shaped microcolonies of organisms embedded within an extracellular glycocalyx, with channels and cavities to allow the exchange of nutrients and waste. The biofilm protects its inhabitants from predators, dehydration, biocides, and other environmental extremes while regulating population growth and diversity through primitive cell signals. From a physiological standpoint, surface-bound bacteria behave quite differently from their planktonic counterparts. Recognizing that bacteria naturally occur as surface-bound and often polymicrobic communities, the practice of performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests using pure cultures and in a planktonic growth mode should be questioned. That this model does not reflect conditions found in nature might help explain the difficulties encountered in the management and treatment of biomedical implant infections.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia in pediatric patients: practical problems and rational solutions.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a common hospital-acquired infection in children, and is  often fatal. Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia include admission to an intensive care unit, intubation, burns, surgery, and underlying chronic illness. Viruses, predominantly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are the most common cause of pediatric nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are the predominant bacterial pathogens, and are associated with a high mortality rate. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are the most common Gram-positive bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia; infections with these organisms have a better outcome than those with Gram-negative organisms. An increasing problem is the emergence of multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. Distinguishing nosocomial pneumonia from other pulmonary processes may be difficult; diagnosis is based on clinical signs, radiological findings, and microbiological results. Recommended empiric therapy should consider factors such as the time of onset of illness, severity of disease, and specific risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia, including use of mechanical ventilation, underlying disease, or recent use of antibacterials. The resident local hospital flora should be considered when selecting therapy for nosocomial pneumonia. Early initiation of appropriate empiric therapy reduces morbidity and mortality. For empiric treatment of bacterial nosocomial pneumonia, an intravenous antibacterial regimen that includes coverage of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive organisms should be used. A carbapenem or ureidopenicillin derivative (piperacillin) plus a beta-lactamase inhibitor should be used where extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are endemic. Therapy should be modified when a specific pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility are identified. Effective prevention of nosocomial pneumonia requires infection control measures that affect the environment, personnel, and patients. Of these, hand hygiene, appropriate infection control policies, and judicious use of antibacterials are essential.
TI  - Rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing of urinary tract isolates and samples  by flow cytometry.
AB  - A multiparametric flow cytometry antimicrobial susceptibility test was developed  and its performance was evaluated on clinical urine isolates and samples in comparison with standard methods. Alterations in cytoplasmic membrane integrity were monitored by propidium iodide, and the anionic probe bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)) was used to measure changes in membrane potential. Microbial size and cellular content were analysed by light scattering. Twelve antibiotics were tested on 6 ATCC control strains, 22 urine isolates and 19 clinical urine samples, variously containing Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. saprophyticus and S. epidermidis. Agreement between the flow cytometry results, broth microdilution and disk diffusion tests was 93.9% (n = 328 tests). Of the 20 discrepancies observed, 18 were for species other than E. coli. Perfect correlation was obtained with five antibiotics, whereas norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin and tetracycline were responsible for 13(65%) of the 20 discrepancies.
TI  - [In vitro antimicrobial activity of glutaraldehyde plus O-phenylphenol association (ratio 2:1)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The correct use of antiseptics, disinfectants and sterilization processes to inactivate or remove micro-organisms is an essential component of an effective infection control program. To reach this result the use of phenolic detergent-disinfectants which work well as a presoak has always been suggested in lieu of sterilization involving submerging instruments in a properly prepared glutaraldehyde solution for about 6 to 10 hrs. This study investigated the in vitro effectiveness of disinfectant solution containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 1% o-phenylphenol. METHODS: The organisms used were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228), and from our clinical collection (Proteus mirabilis CH 14, Klebsiella oxytoca CH 22, Serratia liquefaciens CH 90). MIC and MBC were evaluated as testing solution for antimicrobial activity. The contact time studied between disinfectant and bacteria were 30 sec, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min. RESULTS: The results showed that MIC values for most bacteria were 3.75 mg/ml. The MBC values were similar or higher than the MIC. The disinfectant solution killed E. coli and C. albicans already after 10 min, but for S. aureus 30 min was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that this solution attained the sterilization of surgical instruments in good timing and at low cost.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo activity of antimicrobial-coated prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is a relatively uncommon but very serious condition. As bacterial colonization of the prosthetic heart valve sewing cuff can be a prelude to the clinical occurrence of PVE, antimicrobial coating of the sewing cuff may be beneficial. The study aims were to examine the antimicrobial activity in vitro and anti-infective efficacy in vivo of prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin. METHODS: Zones of inhibition by antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs were assessed in vitro against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The ability of subcutaneously implanted devices coated with minocycline and rifampin to resist colonization and infection by P. aeruginosa was also examined in a rabbit model. RESULTS: Antimicrobial-coated sewing cuffs produced zones of inhibition against all tested organisms. Coated devices were significantly less likely than uncoated devices to become colonized (2/24; 8% versus 20/24; 83%; p <0.001) or to cause device-related infection (0/24; 0% versus 18/24; 75%; p <0.001) and device-related abscess (0/24; 0% versus 10/24; 42%; p <0.001) due to P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Prosthetic heart valve sewing cuffs coated with minocycline and rifampin provide broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro, and are anti-infective in vivo against P. aeruginosa. These results encourage the clinical evaluation of these sewing cuffs.
TI  - [In vitro adherence of bacteria to intraocular lenses of different materials].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the in vitro adherence of different bacteria onto the surface of various intraocular lenses (IOLs). METHOD: Electron microscopic and bacterial culture quantitative methods were used to study the adherence of Staphylococcus (S) epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa onto the surface of PMMA and other three foldable IOL materials (HEMA, ACRY, SI). RESULTS: S. Epidermidis: HEMA < ACRY < SI < PMMA; S. aureus: HEMA was the least and PMMA was the most, no significant difference between ACRY and SI IOLs; P. aeruginosa: HEMA was the least while no significant difference among PMMA, SI and ACRY IOLs (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The foldable IOLs have the potent ability to reduce the infectious endophthalmitis after surgery of extraction of cataract with IOL implantation.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of covalently coupled quaternary ammonium silane coatings on silicone rubber.
AB  - Biomaterial-centered infection is a dreaded complication associated with the use  of biomedical implants. In this paper, the antimicrobial activity of silicone rubber with a covalently coupled 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (QAS) coating was studied in vitro and in vivo. Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH, 102, and Gram-negative Esherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginos AK1 were seeded on silicone rubber with and without QAS-coating, in the absence or presence of adsorbed human plasma proteins. The viability of the adherent bacteria was determined using a live/dead fluorescent stain and a confocal laser scanning microscope. The coating reduced the viability of adherent staphylococci from 90% to 0%), and of Gram-negative bacteria from 90% to 25% while the presencc of adsorbed plasma proteins had little influence. The biomaterials were also subcutaneously implanted in rats for 3 or 7 days, while pre- or postoperatively seeded with S. aureus ATCC 12600. Preoperative seeding resulted in infection of 7 out of 8 silicone rubber implants against 1 out of 8 QAS-coated silicone rubber implants. Postoperative seeding resulted in similar infection incidences on both implant types, but the numbers of adhering bacteria were 70% lower on QAS-coated silicone rubber. In conclusion, QAS-coated silicone rubber shows antimicrobial properties against adhering bacteria, both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some 2-[[alpha-(4-substituted benzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - In this study, a new series of 1-[[alpha-(4-substitutedbenzoyloxy)-alpha-phenylacetyl or methylacetyl]amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were obtained by condensation of 2-[(alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl or alpha-bromopropionyl)amino]-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)1,3,4-oxadiazoles with sodium salts of 4-substituted benzoic acids. Structures of the compounds were assigned on the basis of spectral data (UV, IR, 1H NMR, El MS) and elemental analyses. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using disk diffusion method. Compounds 4a, 4d and 4g were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC, 78, 39 and 78 microg ml(-1), respectively) and compound 4e against S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 (MIC, 156 microg ml(-1)).
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some 1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid derivatives.
AB  - Ethyl 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetate (2), 5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazide (3) and a series of new N-alkylidene/arylidene-5-(2-furyl)-4-ethyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-mercaptoacetic acid hydrazides (4a-f) were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. Compound 4f showed antibacterial activity against some bacteria. The in vitro antimycobacterial activity of the new compounds against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was evaluated employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system. The highest inhibition observed was 61% at > 6.25 microg/ml.
TI  - Microbiology of normal external auditory canal.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To isolate and characterize bacteria and fungi from the healthy ear and to obtain susceptibility profiles on each bacterial isolate. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective. METHODS: Specimens were collected from the external canals and cerumen of healthy subjects. Species-level identification was obtained by combining phenotypic and genotypic data. End-point minimal inhibitory concentration testing was performed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards recommended methods. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four subjects were cultured. Seventeen canal and 16 cerumen specimens showed no growth. One hundred forty-eight cerumen specimens yielded 314 organisms, including 23 fungi. One hundred forty-seven canal specimens yielded 310 organisms, including 7 fungi. Of 291 bacteria isolated from cerumen, 99% were Gram-positive. Of 302 bacteria isolated from the canal, 96% were Gram-positive. Staphylococci were 63% of both the cerumen bacteria and the canal bacteria. Coryneforms represented 22% of the bacteria in cerumen and 19% in the canal. Turicellaotitidis was the primary coryneform isolated from both the canal and the cerumen. Streptococci-like bacteria were 10% from the cerumen, 7% from the canal. In both cerumen and canal, Alloiococcusotitis was more than 95% of the streptococci-like bacteria. Fifteen gram-negative organisms were isolated from the canal and cerumen, including four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The percentages of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates that had high-level resistance (> or =8 microg/mL) were as follows: to neomycin, 28% from cerumen and 11% from the canal; to oxacillin, 28% from cerumen and 25% from the canal; and to ofloxacin, 15% from cerumen and 19% from the canal. CONCLUSIONS: Turcellaotitidis and A. otitidis were present with a much higher frequency than previously described, lending evidence that they be considered normal otic flora. Corynebacterium auris, previously reported only in children, was isolated from normal adults.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo efficacy of catheters impregnated with antiseptics or antibiotics: evaluation of the risk of bacterial resistance to the antimicrobials in the catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a new antiseptic catheter containing silver sulfadiazine and chlorhexidine on the external surface and chlorhexidine in the lumens to an antibiotic catheter impregnated with minocycline and rifampin on its external and luminal surfaces. DESIGN: Experimental trial. METHODS: Antimicrobial spectrum of catheters was determined by zones of inhibition. Resistance to luminal colonization was tested in vitro by locking catheter lumens with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus culture after 7 days of perfusion. In vitro development of resistance to the antiseptic or antibiotic combination used in catheters was investigated. In vivo efficacy was tested (rat subcutaneous model) by challenge with sensitive or antibiotic-resistant bacteria. RESULTS: Antiseptic and antibiotic catheters exhibited broad-spectrum action. However, antibiotic catheters were not effective against Candida species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both catheters prevented luminal colonization. Compared to controls, both test catheters resisted colonization when challenged with S aureus 7 and 14 days' postimplant (P<.05). Repeated in vitro exposure of S epidermidis culture to the antibiotic and antiseptic combinations led to small increases in the minimum inhibitory concentration (15 times and 2 times, respectively). Unlike the antibiotic catheter, the in vitro and in vivo activity of the antiseptic catheter was unaffected by the resistance profile of the test organism. Antiseptic catheters were more effective than antibiotic catheters in preventing colonization by rifampin-resistant S epidermidis in vivo (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Antiseptic and antibiotic catheters exhibit similar efficacy; however, when challenged with a rifampin-resistant strain, the antibiotic catheter appeared to be more susceptible to colonization than the antiseptic device.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--Endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% NaOCl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast Candida albicans. Activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. The base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of Muller Hinton Medium or 10.0 ml of Brain Heart Infusion agar in a Petri dish. After solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of Muller Hinton Medium or Brain Heart Infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. Absorbent paper disks (6.0 mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. Plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. The candle jar system was used for the Brain Heart Infusion agar plates. All tests were performed in duplicate. After incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. Endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% NaOCl was effective only against S. aureus.
TI  - Effect of sulfur hexafluoride gas on antibacterial activity of antibiotics in vitro against agents causing endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We conducted a study to evaluate the effect of sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF(6)) on the antibacterial activity of antibiotics in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are common endophthalmitis-causing agents. METHODS: In this experimental study, antibiotic susceptibility tests were prepared according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards macrobroth dilution method. Muller-Hinton broth was the test medium. Standard P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), S. epidermidis (ATCC 12228) and S. aureus (ATCC 29213) strains were studied. For P. aeruginosa ceftazidime, ofloxacin and tobramycin dilutions, and for S. epidermidis and S. aureus, cefazolin, ofloxacin and tobramycin dilutions were prepared identically in two sets of tubes. One set of tubes, into which pure SF(6) was injected, was defined as the SF(6) group. The other set of tubes, into which no SF(6) was injected, was taken as the control group. To determine the minimal bactericidal concentrations of the antibiotics, subcultures were made onto Muller-Hinton agar, and the colonies were counted after 18 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotics in the SF(6) group were found to be identical with those of the control group. However, the minimal bactericidal concentrations of the antibiotics were found to be at least two dilutions lower in the SF(6) group than in the control group, except for the minimal bactericidal concentration of cefazolin for S. aureus, which was found to be one dilution lower in the SF(6) group. CONCLUSION: SF(6) was found to potentiate the in vitro antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and tobramycin against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa, and cefazolin against S. epidermidis. Experimental animal studies are required to determine the role of SF(6) in the management of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides isolated from skin secretions of the diploid frog, Xenopus tropicalis (Pipidae).
AB  - Seven peptides (XT-1-XT-7) with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the diploid clawed frog, Xenopus tropicalis. Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that amino acid sequence similarity to antimicrobial peptides previously isolated from Xenopus laevis was low, suggesting that the species are not closely related phylogenetically. Peptides XT-5 and XT-3 are probably the orthologs of X. laevis peptide glycine-leucine amide (PGL(a)) and the N-terminal spacer region of prolevitide, respectively. XT-1, XT-6 and XT-7 show limited structural similarity to the spacer region of X. laevis procaeruleins and the paralogs XT-2 and XT-4 are similar to corresponding regions of proxenopsin. Orthologs of the magainins were not identified. The C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide XT-7 (GLLGPLLKIAAKVGSNLL.NH2) showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations against reference microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus 5 microM, Escherichia coli 5 microM, and Candida albicans 40 microM) and was also active against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus group C, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae. The peptide was, however, hemolytic against human erythrocytes (50% lysis at 70 microM). Circular dichroism studies showed that XT-7 has a random structure in aqueous solution, pH 7.0 but adopts an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of 50% trifluoroethanol. Decreasing the cationicity of XT-7 either by replacement of the C-terminal CONH2 group by COOH or by deletion of the Lys(8) residue produced analogs with greatly (>10-fold) decreased antimicrobial potencies.
TI  - A comparison of the use of an ATP-based bioluminescent assay and image analysis for the assessment of bacterial adhesion to standard HEMA and biomimetic soft contact lenses.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro adhesion of clinically relevant bacteria to standard HEMA and novel biomimetic soft contact lenses (SCL) using bioluminescent ATP assay and image analysis. Unworn SCL were incubated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis or Serratia marcescens suspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The level of bacterial adhesion after 1, 2, 4, 6 and 18h, was assessed using both image analysis and a bioluminescent ATP assay. Species differences in the overall level of adhesion to the different types of lens were observed using both measurement techniques. Generally bacterial adhesion was shown to peak at 4-6 h, then decline to a much lower level by 18 h. After 4 h, adhesion of all species of bacteria to the biomimetic SCL (omafilcon A) was found to be significantly lower than to the standard HEMA SCL (polymacon) (p<0.05. Student's t-test, n = 4). Both these techniques demonstrated that novel biomimetic SCL materials exhibit significantly lower bacterial adhesion in vitro compared to standard HEMA SCL materials. SCL manufactured with these novel biomimetic materials may reduce the risk of infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - [Etiology and microbiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in newborns].
AB  - A comparative analysis of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) among premature infants in intensive care units and premature infant nurseries in 1994 (group I) and 1999 (group II) is presented. It was shown that the number of the cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the premature infants of group. I was 2,4 times higher than that in the group II (45.8 and 19.2 per cent respectively). A marked difference in the species pattern of the pathogens isolated from the endobronchial aspirate in 1994 and 1999 was observed. The species pattern of the isolates from the respiratory tract (Pseudomonas aeruginosa--40 per cent; Klebsiella pneumoniae--31 per cent; Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus--rare) showed that the pneumonia were nosocomial. The revealed similarity of the species patterns of the microflora in various parts of the respiratory tract and the throat posterior wall made it possible to consider the isolates of the throat posterior wall as a relative guide for confirming the etiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - [Experimental study of photodynamic effect on bacterial wound microflora].
AB  - The in vitro study of the influence of photodynamic action (with the use of photosensitizer "Photosens", laser and non-laser irradiation) on the strains of the main representatives purulent wound microflora was carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis cultures have been isolated from wound secretions and identified. The photosensitizer was shown to produce no bactericidal effect by itself. Irradiation with laser and non-laser light sources induced a sharp decrease in the number of viable cells in the cultures under study. The irradiation of the photosensitizer led to its activation, manifested in bactericidal action. The results thus obtained confirm good prospect of using photodynamic therapy for the treatment of purulent wounds.
TI  - Samioside, a new phenylethanoid glycoside with free-radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities from Phlomis samia.
AB  - A new phenylethanoid glycoside, samioside, was isolated from the aerial parts of  Phlomis samia and identified as 1-O-3,4-(dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->4)-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->3)-4-O-caffeoyl-beta-D- glucopyranoside (1). In addition, one known phenylethanoid glycoside and three known flavonoids were identified as acteoside (2), apigenin, chrysoeriol, and ermanin, respectively. The structure of 1 was elucidated on the basis of its spectroscopic data. Samioside (1) demonstrated scavenging properties toward the DPPH radical and antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Verbalactone, a new macrocyclic dimer lactone from the roots of Verbascum undulatum with antibacterial activity.
AB  - A novel macrocyclic dimer lactone, named verbalactone, was isolated from the roots of Verbascum undulatum and exhibited interesting antibacterial activity. It is the first time that 1,7-dioxacyclododecane is reported as the ring system of a natural product. The structure and the absolute stereochemistry of the new compound were determined by spectral methods and chemical correlation.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Method for studying development of colonization and infection of dialysis catheters.
AB  - Microbial colonization and infection of dialysis catheters is the major cause of  catheter failure. The present study aimed to develop a method to permit the study of microbial biofilm formation and antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy. Standard silicon rubber and silver-impregnated catheters were sectioned into 1 mm slices and placed into 1-cm x 2-cm culture slide chambers. Fresh clinical isolates were obtained from infected patients and suspended in concentrations of 10(3), 10(6), and 10(9) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter in a variety of liquid suspending culture media, which included serum protein constituents. Antibiotics could be added to the suspending fluid to determine prophylactic activity, or at any time thereafter to determine therapeutic activity. The catheter sections were incubated with the microbial challenge for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours and then washed in flowing distilled water to remove unattached biofilm. They were then stained with acridine orange, which fluoresces microbial DNA, and were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Biofilm formation, representing colonization and infection, were quantified by comparing the fluorescent pixel analysis of the uninoculated control with the challenged catheter. The method was reproducible and permitted quantitative analysis. Standard silicon rubber catheters demonstrated greater biofilm formation than silver-impregnated catheters. The method examines the factors involved in microbial colonization and infection, and in antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy.
TI  - Multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  - Multiple organ failure (MOF) is the main cause of death in ICUs, especially affecting septic patients. It is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. The prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. The objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital ICU related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of MOF, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. The mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. The main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. A retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the ICU in a 4 month period during 1999. Fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by ACCS/SCCM criteria. There were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency patients). APACHE II score was calculated on admission and MOF, measured for the first five days, was diagnosed using Marshall and Meakins criteria. The statistical method used was non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. The incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). Thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. Death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). None of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%), died. There were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. The most frequent bacteria found were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumanii (3), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Enterobacter aerogenes (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (2). The mean value +/- SD of APACHE II (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). We conclude that MOF due to sepsis in an ICU is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high APACHE II.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of leaf essential oils and their constituents from Cinnamomum osmophloeum.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of the essential oils from leaves of two Cinnamomum  osmophloeum clones (A and B) and their chemical constituents were investigated in this study. The nine strains of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and Vibrio parahemolyticus, were used in the antibacterial tests. Results from the antibacterial tests demonstrated that the indigenous cinnamon B leaf essential oils had an excellent inhibitory effect. The MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of the B leaf oil were 500 microg/ml against both K. pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. and 250 microg/ml against the other seven strains of bacteria. Cinnamaldehyde possessed the strongest antibacterial activity compared to the other constituents of the essential oils. The MICs of cinnamaldehyde against the E. coli, P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, MRSA, K. pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., and V. parahemolyticus were 500, 1000, 250, 250, 250, 250, 1000, 500, and 250 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that C. osmophloeum leaf essential oil and cinnamaldehyde are beneficial to human health, having the potential to be used for medical purposes and to be utilized as anti-bacterial additives in making paper products.
TI  - Discospondylitis associated with three unreported bacteria in the dog.
AB  - Three cases of discospondylitis in the dog, caused respectively by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, are reported. These bacteria have not previously been documented as being the cause of the condition in this species. The neurological involvement was severe in all three cases. Two dogs were paraplegic and one was tetraplegic, and one of the paraplegic dogs had no deep pain on the extremities of both pelvic limbs. All dogs were treated surgically with a satisfactory neurological recovery.
TI  - [Hospital infections and risk factors in the intensive care units of 16 Dutch hospitals, results of surveillance of quality assurance indicators].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gain insight into the incidence of nosocomial infections and associated risk factors in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). DESIGN: Prospective. METHOD: From July 1997 to December 1999, standardised surveillance of nosocomial infections was implemented in ICUs in 16 hospitals in the Netherlands. Surveillance was performed in patients with an ICU stay of > or = 48 hrs; data were collected from admission until discharge from ICU. Data-collection included demographic data and patient- and treatment-related risk factors. The data were aggregated in a national database. RESULTS: In the research period, hospitals sent good quality data for aggregation in the national database on 2795 patients (61% male) and 27,922 ICU patient days. The median length of stay was six days, the median 'Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation' (APACHE) II score was 17 and the median age was 67 years. A total number of 749 infected patients were found with 1,177 nosocomial infections (27% of patients, 42 infections/1000 patient days), consisting of 43% pneumonia, 20% sepsis, 21% urinary tract infections, 16% other types of infections. Out of all the patients, 62% was on mechanical ventilation, 64% had a central venous line and 89% had a urinary catheter in situ. Selective decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract was used for 12% of the patients, and systemic antibiotics for 68%. Micro-organisms most frequently isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis in catheter-related bloodstream infections and Escherichia coli in patients with urinary tract infections. Large differences in device use and incidence of infections were observed between the ICUs. CONCLUSION: The aggregated data gave insight into the incidence of nosocomial infections and associated risk factors in ICUs. The data are meant as references to support decision- and policy-making in local infection control programs.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Diagnosis and management of osteomyelitis.
AB  - Acute osteomyelitis is the clinical term for a new infection in bone. This infection occurs predominantly in children and is often seeded hematogenously. In adults, osteomyelitis is usually a subacute or chronic infection that develops secondary to an open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue. The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i.e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. For optimal results, antibiotic therapy must be started early, with antimicrobial agents administered parenterally for at least four to six weeks. Treatment generally involves evaluation, staging, determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.
TI  - Activity of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against urinary pathogens.
AB  - This study compares the antibacterial activities of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against recently isolated urinary tract pathogens, by evaluating their MICs and MBCs in accordance with NCCLS susceptibility tests, time-kill curves and interference with bacterial adhesion to uroepithelial cells. A total of 200 clinical isolates was tested, including the species Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin and only one was resistant to ciprofloxacin, and there were no differences between beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains. K. pneumoniae strains resistant to ciprofloxacin were also resistant to levofloxacin. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus seemed to be less susceptible than methicillin-susceptible strains to these quinolones. S. epidermidis strains were susceptible to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with the exception of two isolates. Incubation of S. aureus and E. coli with subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations reduced their capacity to adhere to uroepithelial cells; this was statistically significant at 0.25 x MIC with respect to controls (P < 0.05). Inhibition of adhesion ranged from 36 to 43% when bacteria were incubated in the presence of 0.25 x MIC of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and from 10 to 27% at 0.125 x MIC. These findings suggest that levofloxacin is an effective alternative to ciprofloxacin in the treatment of urinary tract infections and that sub-inhibitory concentrations may contribute to efficacy.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of positively charged surfaces on adhering Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The infection of biomaterials is determined by an interplay of adhesion and surface growth of the infecting organisms. In this study, the antimicrobial effects on adhering bacteria of a positively charged poly(methacrylate) surface (xi potential +12 mV) were compared with those of negatively charged poly(methyl methacrylate) (-12 mV) and a highly negatively charged poly(methacrylate) (-18 mV) surface. Initial adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH(2) 102, Escherichia coli O2K2 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 to these surfaces was measured in a parallel plate flow chamber in phosphate-buffered saline. Adhering bacteria were allowed to multiply by perfusing the flow chamber with growth medium. All bacteria adhered most rapidly to the positively charged surface, but there was no subsequent surface growth of the Gram-negative strains. On the negatively charged surfaces, despite a slower initial adhesion, surface growth of the adhering bacteria was exponential for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that positively charged biomaterial surfaces exert an antimicrobial effect on adhering Gram-negative bacteria, but not on Gram-positive ones.
TI  - Study on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria causing neonatal infections: a  12 year study (1987-1998).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The method of Manual of Clinical Microbiology was used to identify bacteria. We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of bacterial agents and their antimicrobial susceptibility as empirical treatment for neonatal infections. Disk diffusion tests were also done for antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: From January 1987 to December 1998, 2,244 bacterial strains were isolated in our neonatal ward. The first three predominant species were Staphylococcus epidermidis (23.9%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (19.9%) and Escherichia coli (12.6%) in group I (infections acquired outside of hospital). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 18%, 15.2% and 12.6% respectively in group II (nosocomial infections). The sensitivity rates of those antimicrobials that are seldom used for newborns were found to be higher, while the resistant rates of the commonly used antimicrobial drugs have increased significantly. The resistant rates of bacterial isolate from group II to antimicrobial agents including penicillin and ampicillin were significantly higher than those isolated from group I (p<0.05)The sensitivity rate was 82.2% (717/833) by using amikacin only, when combined with penicillin, rose to 89%(741/833). CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria were mainly responsible for nosocomial infections of neonates in our hospital. Infections acquired outside the hospital were mainly caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Nosocomial pathogens produced drug resistance easily. Combination of amikacin and penicillin can be recommended as the initial antibiotics for treatment of neonatal infections.
TI  - [Primary study of bacterial adhesion of prosthetic valve materials].
AB  - The adhesion of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans to Dacron and pyrolite carbon was measured in vitro with plate counting. The experimental result showed: the bacterials used in the experiment have adhesion to prosthetic valve materials; the bacterials have stronger adhesion to Dacron than to Pyrolite carbon; the bacterial adhesive capacity is significantly different and is affected by mechanical and chemical nature of biomaterials; Staphylococcur aureus has the strongest adhesion to Dacron, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the strongest adhesion to pyrolite carbon in all bacterials.
TI  - Chemical constituents of Pseudopterogorgia species of the Indian ocean.
AB  - A new ceramide, (2S,3R,4E)-1,3-dihydroxy-2-[(hexadecanoyl)amino]-nonadeca-4-ene (1), cholest-5-en-3beta,7beta,19-triol (2), identified as its, peracetyl derivative (3), and batyl alcohol (4) were isolated from Pseudopterogorgia species. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Designing surfaces that kill bacteria on contact.
AB  - Poly(4-vinyl-N-alkylpyridinium bromide) was covalently attached to glass slides to create a surface that kills airborne bacteria on contact. The antibacterial properties were assessed by spraying aqueous suspensions of bacterial cells on the surface, followed by air drying and counting the number of cells remaining viable (i.e., capable of growing colonies). Amino glass slides were acylated with acryloyl chloride, copolymerized with 4-vinylpyridine, and N-alkylated with different alkyl bromides (from propyl to hexadecyl). The resultant surfaces, depending on the alkyl group, were able to kill up to 94 +/- 4% of Staphylococcus aureus cells sprayed on them. A surface alternatively created by attaching poly(4-vinylpyridine) to a glass slide and alkylating it with hexyl bromide killed 94 +/- 3% of the deposited S. aureus cells. On surfaces modified with N-hexylated poly(4-vinylpyridine), the numbers of viable cells of another Gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, as well as of the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, dropped more than 100-fold compared with the original amino glass. In contrast, the number of viable bacterial cells did not decline significantly after spraying on such common materials as ceramics, plastics, metals, and wood.
TI  - Comparative radiolabel and ATP analyses of adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis to hydrogel lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: A comparative assessment of the relative primary adhesion of cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its lux transformant, and of slime and non-slime producing strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis to various hydrogel lenses was conducted. METHODS: Hydrogel lenses were placed in cell suspensions with bacteria with or without a tritiated leucine label. After 2 hours exposure, the lenses were rinsed vigorously and densities of cells on the lenses were determined via scintillation counting or ATP analyses. RESULTS: The radiolabel procedure indicated greater numbers than the ATP analyses of adhered cells per lens per common inoculum of all strains. All strains exhibited greater primary adhesion to the 38% water content contact lens, with the lux transformant of P. aeruginosa showing the greatest degree of adhesion. Primary adhesion by P. aeruginosa was typically at least ten-fold greater per lens than that observed with S. epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: Both a radiolabel-cell procedure and bioluminescent ATP analyses demonstrated similar patterns of primary adhesion of bacteria to hydrogel lenses. Generally the adhesion increased inversely to the water content of the lenses but the chemical composition of the lenses, particularly surface properties, altered this pattern for lenses of similar water content. The magnitude of primary adhesion varied with the species and strain of bacterium.
TI  - Low-power microwave disinfection of soft contact lenses.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness of low-power microwave irradiation on the  disinfection of contaminated contact lenses. METHODS: We infected 24 soft contact lenses with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each contact lens was placed into a vial containing 10 mL of contaminated, non-preserved saline. Each vial was then exposed to 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, or 18 minutes of microwave irradiation in an oven (2,450 MHz 600W) set at 10% power. RESULTS: We found all contact lenses to be disinfected after 15 minutes of exposure. All lenses remained hydrated and revealed no apparent damage when examined under the slit-lamp biomicroscope. CONCLUSIONS: Low level microwaving in a home microwave oven can result in effective and non-damaging disinfection of soft contact lenses.
TI  - [Opportunistic microorganisms in urinary tract diseases].
AB  - The microflora of clinical material (urine, urethral discharge and smear, vaginal discharge and smear, feces in colonic dysbacteriosis) from patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) in the Moscow Region was studied. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis have been found to be the most common agents isolated from the urine of UTI patients. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other staphylococcal species and enterococci account for a smaller proportion of infections. High- (E. coli and S. epidermidis) and moderate-priority pathogens are translocated into the urinary tract from the colonic biotope in dysbacteriosis. The causative agents of non-gonococcal urethritis are staphylococci (more commonly epidermal ones) in 50% of cases, those of pyelonephritis are staphylococci (predominantly E. coli) in more than 50% of cases. The etiological agents of female genital infections are staphylococci (mainly epidermal ones) in 40% of cases.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Synthesis of Mannich bases of some 2,5-disubstituted 4-thiazolidinones and evaluation of their antimicrobial activities.
AB  - 5-Phenyl/methyl-5-morpholinomethyl/pyrrolidinomethyl-2-(5- aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (5a-m) were synthesized by the reaction of 5-phenyl/methyl-2-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol -2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (4a-j) with formaldehyde and morpholine or pyrrolidine. The structures of the compounds were determined by analytical and spectral (IR, 1H-NMR, EIMS) methods. The antibacterial activities of the novel compounds against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri and Proteus mirabilis and antifungal activity against Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were tested using the disk diffusion method. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5c, 5e, 5g, and 5h were found to be active against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC: 312.5; 39; 19.5; 39; 156; and 78 micrograms/mL respectively) and compounds 5c and 5h against S. flexneri (MIC: both 312.5 micrograms/mL). The minimal inhibitory concentrations of these compounds were determined using the micro dilution method.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol isolated from Magnolia officinalis.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of honokiol and magnolol, the main constituents of Magnolia officinalis was investigated. The antimicrobial activity was assayed by the agar dilution method using brain heart infusion medium and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determined for each compound using a twofold serial dilution assay. The results showed that honokiol and magnolol have a marked antimicrobial effect (MIC = 25 microg/mL) against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis, but did not show antimicrobial activity (MIC > or = 100 microg/mL) for Shigella flexneii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results indicate that honokiol and magnolol, although less potent than tetracycline, show a significant antimicrobial activity for periodontal pathogens. Hence we suggest that honokiol and magnolol might have the potential to be an adjunct in the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Optimization of the resistance of arterial allografts to infection: comparative study with synthetic prostheses.
AB  - Arterial allografts can be used for in situ treatment of prosthetic graft infection. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the resistance of allografts and synthetic prostheses to infection by five strains of bacteria and to study antibiotic treatments designed to reduce allograft infection. Fresh and cryopreserved allografts were compared with synthetic prostheses made of various biomaterials including PTFE, plain Dacron, gelatine-sealed Dacron, and gelatine-sealed, rifampicine-bonded Dacron. Allografts were used with or without treatment using an antibiotic containing gentamycine, lincomycine, and vancomycine. The bacterial strains tested were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, non-slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection was evaluated by counting the number of adherent bacteria on the allograft or synthetic material after rinsing and ultrasonication. Statistical analysis was achieved using nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Results showed that allografts not treated with antibiotics were highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Antibiotic treatment decreased infection. Application of antibiotic after thawing cryopreserved allografts led to a significant decrease. None of the biomaterials tested provided sufficient protection against bacteria resistant to the antibiotics used.
TI  - [A molecular and epidemiology study in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate causative agents in patients with ventilator-associated (VA) pneumonia epidemiologically, then to provide useful suggestion for diagnosis and treatment of VA pneumonia. METHOD: Prospectively, a protected specimens brush was used to obtain the secretion of lower respiratory tract of 65 patients, who had been receiving mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy for more than 72 hours. At the same time, other samples were collected from the relevant places, including pharyngeal and gastric juice of patients as well as other persons, ward's air. The secretion obtained were cultured with a quantitative method. Then all bacteria isolated were studied with the analysis of pattern of plasmids and chromosomal restriction endonuclease. RESULT: It was showed that the route of infection of the Gram-negative bacilli in VA pneumonia (19 cases) was intrinsic, a retrograde colonization from patient's stomach, that was the pattern of clonization from stomach to pharynx, then into lower respiratory tract, and the Gram-positive staphylococcus spread mainly through the ward's air, then directly into lower respiratory tract, or extrinsic (20 cases). CONCLUSION: The Gram-positive staphylococcus is also major disease-producing germs in VA pneumonia, and the infection routes of G+ and G- bacteria might be different.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - How quantitative is quantitative PCR with respect to cell counts?
AB  - Quantitative diagnostic PCR systems based upon rDNA targeted primer and probe combinations were developed for the detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas alcaligenes, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Primers and probes were designed in silico using the ARB software package (TU Munich) in combination with Primer Design software of PE Applied Biosystems. Purified genomic DNA or bacterial cells of target and reference organisms were used for the evaluation of the PCR assays applying the TaqMan technique on an ABI PRISM TM 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Sensitive, reliable and reproducible quantification of target rDNA could be achieved applying primer-probe combinations that mediate in vitro amplification of DNA fragments smaller than 100 base pairs. Large amounts of non target DNA (1 mg per sample) remarkably affected the quantification potential of the approach resulting in an underestimation of the amounts of target DNA. One of the principal goals was to use quantitative PCR to study the correlation of gene and cell numbers depending on the growth behavior of target organisms and to explore the potential to estimate cell numbers from target DNA quantification. A clear correlation of rDNA quantification and bacterial growth was observed, however, cell numbers cannot directly be estimated from quantitative PCR data, given that the cellular genome content varies with the growth phase of the organisms. In the case of Escherichia coli the cell numbers which could be assigned to a certain number of rDNA targets varied reasonably depending upon the growth phase of batch cultures.
TI  - Determination of the antibacterial efficacy of several antiseptics tested on skin by an 'ex-vivo' test.
AB  - There are many skin antiseptics commercially available. Although their antibacterial activity has often been well studied, their potential effectiveness on skin remains poorly documented. To date, in-vivo protocols designed for the testing of the antimicrobial efficacy of antiseptics cannot use, for ethical reasons, pathogenic bacteria or new formulations whose toxicity in human subjects is unknown. An 'ex-vivo' test was recently developed to overcome these problems. Freshly excised human skin from abdominal or breast reduction was placed in a diffusion cell containing a maintenance medium in the recipient compartment. A bacterial inoculum was then applied to the stratum corneum and, after a drying step, antiseptic formulations were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. Several micro-organisms were investigated: - Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant Ent. faecium (VRE), S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli--with several biocides--para-chloro-meta-xylenol (PCMX, active compound of Dettol), povidone iodine, triclosan (in isopropanol) and chlorhexidine. Results from the ex-vivo test were compared with results obtained in suspension and glass-carrier tests. The bactericidal activity of the biocides depended upon the test performed and results were generally significantly different from one method to the other. All biocides tested in the suspension test achieved >4 log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentrations, apart from povidone iodine tested against Ent. faecalis and VRE. The antibacterial activity of biocides tested in the glass-carrier test was significantly lower than in the suspension test, with the exception of triclosan in isopropanol, which was as effective in both suspension and glass-carrier test. In the ex-vivo test, triclosan in isopropanol achieved a log10 reduction in viable bacterial concentration of 1.105-1.771 (with the exception of P. aeruginosa with 0.758 log10 reduction). PCMX, povidone iodine and chlorhexidine achieved log10 reductions in viable bacterial concentration of 0.303-0.901. Chlorhexidine tested against P. aeruginosa produced a 1.94 log10 reduction in concentration. These results confirm previous observations about the need for testing the antimicrobial activity of antiseptics on skin surface to determine their in-situ efficacy and encourage further the use of the ex-vivo protocol.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial activity of sealers and pastes used in endodontics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (AH Plus, Sealapex, Ketac Endo, and Fill Canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (Calen and Calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. Seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 10541. There was a wild strain of Streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. Activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with Brain Heart Infusion agar and Muller Hinton medium seeded by pour plate. Calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm wells or by using absorbent paper points. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. After incubation at 37 degrees C for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% TTC gel and inhibition haloes were measured. All bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. However, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, Enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by AH Plus, Fill Canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. We conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% TTC gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.
TI  - Influence of human wet cerumen on the growth of common and pathogenic bacteria of the ear.
AB  - The available data on the effect of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth are not conclusive. Nevertheless it is widely accepted that cerumen has a bactericidal effect. In this study the activity of human wet cerumen on bacterial growth was assessed by applying cerumen suspensions to bacterial cultures. Bacterial counts were performed before and after application of cerumen suspensions. A total of 383 assays was carried out with 73 pools of cerumen that were tested against cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. An increase in growth occurred much more frequently than a decrease in growth in almost every microrganism tested, with the mean increase percentage being much higher than the mean decrease percentage, except in the case of S. aureus. The largest average growth increase was obtained with E. coli. The largest average decrease in bacterial growth was recorded with S. marcescens. Our study does not support the conception of a decrease in bacterial growth produced by humen wet cerumen. In vitro, the most observable effect was in fact an increase in microbial growth.
TI  - Mechanisms of biofilm resistance to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Biofilms are communities of microorganisms attached to a surface. It has become clear that biofilm-grown cells express properties distinct from planktonic cells, one of which is an increased resistance to antimicrobial agents. Recent work has indicated that slow growth and/or induction of an rpoS-mediated stress response could contribute to biocide resistance. The physical and/or chemical structure of exopolysaccharides or other aspects of biofilm architecture could also confer resistance by exclusion of biocides from the bacterial community. Finally, biofilm-grown bacteria might develop a biofilm-specific biocide-resistant phenotype. Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the biofilm, it is likely that there are multiple resistance mechanisms at work within a single community. Recent research has begun to shed light on how and why surface-attached microbial communities develop resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Inhibition of neutrophil elastase prevents cathelicidin activation and impairs clearance of bacteria from wounds.
AB  - The host defense roles of neutrophil elastase in a porcine skin wound chamber model were explored. Analysis of wound fluid by acid-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blot, and bacterial overlay confirmed that the neutrophil-derived protegrins constituted the major stable antimicrobial polypeptide in the wound fluid. The application to the wound of 0.10 and 0.25 mM N-methoxysuccinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-valine (AAPV) chloromethyl ketone, a specific neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI), blocked the proteolytic activation of protegrins and diminished the associated antimicrobial activity as detected by radial diffusion assay against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans or by bacterial gel overlay against S epidermidis and E coli. The application of the related cathepsin G inhibitor (CGI), benzyloxycarbonyl-glycine-leucine-phenylalanine (ZGLF) chloromethyl ketone, had no effect. In wound chambers that received 10(6) colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL of S epidermidis, the presence of NEI significantly decreased the 24-hour clearance of bacteria from the wound compared to wounds treated with CGI or solvent only. Neither inhibitor, at 0.10 or 0.25 mM concentration, affected leukocyte accumulation or degranulation in the wound chambers. The in vitro microbicidal decrement due to NEI was restored by an amount of the specific protegrin (PG-1), which was equivalent to the measured difference of protegrin between control and inhibited chambers. Administration of 1 microg/mL exogenous PG-1 4 hours after chamber preparation was sufficient to normalize in vivo antimicrobial activity. Although pharmacologic NEIs are promising candidates as anti-inflammatory drugs, they may impair host defense in part by inhibiting the activation of cathelicidins by neutrophil elastase.
TI  - Activation and control of complement, inflammation, and infection associated with the use of biomedical polymers.
AB  - It is generally acknowledged that artificial biomaterials are much less immunologically active than transplants or tissue derived biomaterials. However, activation of both the coagulation cascade and the complement system is a common occurrence when human blood is exposed to biomaterial surfaces during extracorporeal procedures, such as renal hemodialysis or cardiopulmonary bypass. Both individual and collective activation of these cascades often produce local and systemic effects. A number of complement activation products function as the mediators of inflammation. They serve as ligands for specific receptors on polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, macrophages, mast cells, and other cells. Such an interaction leads to induction of cellular responses in adhered cells, including release of oxidative products, lysosomal enzymes, or both, which often contribute to a number of pathologic conditions. Most pathogens invading the human body are attacked by the immune system directly following entry, especially when they are in contact with blood. However, bacteria and parasites have developed a large number of specific strategies to overcome immune defense among others by avoiding either recognition or eradication by complement. In this aspect, of concern are several microorganisms responsible for formation of antibiotic resistant biofilms on biomaterial surfaces, namely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Comparative in vitro Activity of Meropenem Versus Other Extended-Spectrum Antimicrobial Agents Against 2,085 Clinical Isolates Tested in 13 Brazilian Centers.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibacterial agent with a very broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. It is the second agent of its class to become available in Brazil. The in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem was compared with imipenem and four other antimicrobial agents in a multicenter study. This study involved 13 clinical microbiology laboratories, 10 of which came from 8 Brazilian states. A total of 2,085 clinical isolates consecutively collected between December 1995 and March 1996 were susceptibility tested using the Etest and following the NCCLS procedures. Meropenem inhibited more than 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.5 microg/mL, except for Citrobacter sp. (1 microg/ml). Generally, meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem against Gram-negative organisms and its spectrum of antimicrobial activity was broader than those of all other drugs tested. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem (MIC50, 0.38 microg/ml) was approximately 8-fold more active than imipenem (MIC 50,3 microg/mL). Imipenem was two-to eight-fold more active than meropenem against some Gram-positive specees oxacillin, including Enterococcus faecalis (MIC 50 of 0.75 microg/mL and 2 microg/mL respectively), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 50 of 0.47 &mul;g/mL and 0.094 microg/mL), oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC 50 of 0.064 microg/mL and 0.5mg/mL). Against Streptococcus sp. meropenem was slightly more active than imipenem (MIC 50, 0.016 microg/mL). The results of this study may be used to guide empiric therapy in Brazil and indicates that meropenem may have an important role in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant strains of bacteria.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports from Europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on Day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. To assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) CFU/mL) by day of storage. RESULTS: All examples of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL by Day 3 after inoculation. By Day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) CFU per mL. Units contaminated with S. epidermidis showed slower and more varied growth. By Day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) CFU per mL. By Day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: These experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) CFU per mL on Day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. It would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - Septic arthritis in childhood.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to determine whether there was a difference between septic arthritis (SA) combined with osteomyelitis and SA alone with regard to clinical and laboratory findings, such as symptoms on admission, age, sex, joint involvement and isolated micro-organisms, and a relationship between age and joint involvement in SA. In addition, we also aimed to determine the prognostic factors in SA. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory findings of 40 patients who were diagnosed with SA in our hospital were reviewed retrospectively. The diagnosis of SA was made according to the following criteria: immediate joint fluid aspiration (culture and Gram's stain positive, leukocyte count markedly elevated and glucose level low), blood culture positive and positive cultures from other possible sites of infection. RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 22 were boys, 18 were girls and the male to female ratio was 1.2/1. Patient ages ranged from 6 months to 14 years (mean (+/- SD) 8.44 +/- 4.18 years). The most observed symptoms were fever (52.5%), arthralgia (50%) and joint swelling (45%). Thirty-four (85%) patients had only one joint and six patients (15%) had more than one joint involved. In total, arthritis was diagnosed in 49 joints. The joints diagnosed as having arthritis were the following: knee (n = 18), hip (n = 12), ankle (n = 12), elbow (n = 3), shoulder (n = 2), wrist (n = 1) and interphalangeal joint (n = 1). Of the 40 patients, 21 (52.5%) had SA alone and 19 (47.5%) had arthritis together with osteomyelitis. While arthritis was diagnosed in 27 joints in the group of patients with SA, it was diagnosed in 22 joints in the group of patients with SA combined with osteomyelitis; in the latter, an increase was not observed in the number of joints involved. Joint fluid culture was positive in 22 (55%) patients; the growth of Staphylococcus aureus was observed in 20 cases and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated in each patient. In contrast, in one patient, arthritis occured during meningococcal meningitis (in this patient, Gram-negative diplococci was isolated from a cerebrospinal fluid culture). Patients with SA combined with osteomyelitis and those with SA alone were compared for symptoms on admission, the history of trauma and antibiotic use, sex, age, fever, joint involvement, anemia, leukocytosis and micro-organisms isolated from joint fluid and blood; there were no significant differences for these parameters between the two groups (P > 0.05). In addition, we found that there was no relationship between age and joint involvement in SA and there was no effect of micro-organisms on mortality. Three of 40 patients died; the mortality rate was 7.3%. Of the three patients who died, two had SA alone and one had SA combined with osteomyelitis. The primary disease was sepsis in these three patients; S. aureus was cultured from blood in two patients and Gram-positive cocci was observed following examination of the joint fluid in the other patient. CONCLUSIONS: We would like to emphasize that SA is mono-articular, frequently localized in the knee, hip and ankle in 85% of patients, joint fluid culture was positive in 55% of patients, bacteria was isolated from one or more cultures of blood, joint fluid, pus or bone in 70% of patients and the most common isolated micro-organism was S. aureus. In addition, it must be pointed out that children younger than 2 years of age with fever, a positive trauma history and/or abnormal joint findings should be carefully examined for SA because the rate of SA was lower (7.5%) than expected in this age group. We also found that the mortality of SA was not influenced by age, joint involvement and bacterial agents, and there was no significant difference in symptoms on admission, the history of trauma and antibiotic use, sex, age, fever, joint involvement,anemia, leukocytosis and micro-organisms isolated from joint fluid and blood between patients with SA
TI  - Analysis of microbiological trends in peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis from 1991 to 1998.
AB  - The microbial cause of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis is an important determinant of clinical outcome and the basis of widely used treatment guidelines. Five hundred forty-six cases of peritonitis in 374 patients from 1991 to 1998 were analyzed. The rate of peritonitis declined significantly from 1.37 episodes/patient-year in 1991 to 0.55 episode/patient-year in 1998 (P = 0.02). The rate of Gram-positive peritonitis decreased significantly from 0.75 to 0.28 episode/patient-year during the same period (P = 0.02). Conversely, the occurrence of Gram-negative peritonitis remained constant at approximately 0.16 episode/patient-year (P = 0.28). Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common causes of peritonitis, isolated in 27.8% and 19.3% of the culture-positive cases, respectively. A distinct decrease in peritonitis caused by S epidermidis was observed, with 0.40 episode/patient-year in 1991 compared with 0.11 to 0.20 episode/patient-year during subsequent years. The rate of infections caused by S aureus decreased significantly over time from a high of 0.21 episode/patient-year in 1992 to a low of 0.04 episode/patient-year in 1998 (P = 0.01). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and KLEBSIELLA: species were the most common causes of Gram-negative peritonitis, identified in 7.1%, 6.8%, and 5.2% of culture-positive cases, respectively. The most dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance was seen among S epidermidis. From 1991 and 1992 to 1997 and 1998, resistance to ciprofloxacin increased from 5.4% to 47.8% (P = 0.003), and resistance to methicillin increased from 18.9% to 73.9% (P = 0.03). Our study showed significant trends in the causative pathogens of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis and dramatic increases in antibiotic resistance. These data support further study and warrant reevaluation of current treatment practices.
TI  - [Infectious endocarditis in intravenous drug abusers].
AB  - Clinical course of infectious endocarditis (IE) was analysed for 43 intravenous drug abusers. 42 of them had primary IE, one patient--secondary. Acute course and high activity of the disease were registered in 86% of the patients. IE was provoked by Staphylococcus aureus (50%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 920%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (11%), E. coli (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%), Candida albicans (2%), mixed microflora (7%). Vegetations were detected on the tricuspid, mitral and aortic valves (52, 23 and 19%, respectively), on more than one valve (6%). Pneumonia, pleuricy, hydrothorax, enlargement of the liver, spleen, nephritis and anemia were found in 76, 44, 9, 100, 75, 70 and 88% of the patients, respectively. Cardiac failure aggravated the disease in half of the patients, lethality was 18%. Thus, IE in intravenous drug abusers is characterized by a primary form, acute active course, prevalent damage to the tricuspid valve, polyorganic involvement, high lethality. IE cure in such patients is feasible only in adequate antibacterial therapy, timely surgical correction and giving up drug abuse.
TI  - Activity of cecropin P1 and FA-LL-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  - Two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, FA-LL-37 and cecropin P1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five Lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. Both peptides inhibited Escherichia coli at 25 microM (FA-LL-39), and 1.56 microM (cecropin P1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microM, and 25 microM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microM, and 1.56 microM), but not Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. FA-LL-37 acted bacteriocidally against E. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two Gram-negative organisms. Cecropin P1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. Lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate Lactobacillus fermentum B-54, which was susceptible to FA-LL-37 at 100 microM. The differential activities of these peptides toward Gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. In addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro pharmacodynamics of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against common ocular pathogens.
AB  - PURPOSE: Time-kill curve methodology was used to assess the pharmacodynamics of two fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against six strains representing the most common ocular pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Haemophilus influenzae. METHODS: For time-kill studies, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0.5 x, 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) for each respective strain. Inocula were prepared by diluting overnight cultures to final concentrations of 10(2), 10(3), 10(4), and 10(5) cfu (colony-forming units)/mL in each antibiotic solution. Growth controls were included. Viability counts of antibiotic-containing and control bacterial suspensions were performed at 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 minutes. RESULTS: In general, the kill rates of ofloxacin at 1.0 x, 2.0 x, and 3.0 x the MIC were significantly faster than the kill rates of ciprofloxacin by approximately 30 minutes, regardless of the bacterial concentration tested. At 0.5 x MIC, the kill kinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were similar, regardless of the strain tested. At 1.0 x MIC, ofloxacin achieved 99.9% killing of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus within 30 minutes, and S. epidermidis and S. marcescens within 90 minutes. Overall, the kill kinetics of both quinolones for H. influenzae were similar, while neither quinolone achieved 99.9% killing of S. pneumoniae, regardless of the antibiotic concentration tested. CONCLUSION: Time-kill curve analyses in the present study demonstrate that ofloxacin achieved killing of the majority of ocular pathogens tested at rates equivalent to or faster than that of ciprofloxacin. Both fluoroquinolones were more effective against nonencapsulated bacteria than against encapsulated bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-[(alpha-haloacyl)amino] thiazoles and 5-nonsubstituted/substituted 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones.
AB  - 4-Carbethoxymethyl-2-[(chloroacetyl/alpha-chloropropionyl/al pha- bromobutyryl/alpha-chloro-(alpha-phenylacetyl)amino]thiazoles (I-IV) were synthesized by reacting 4-carbethoxymethyl-2-aminothiazole with chloroacetyl chloride, alpha-chloropropionyl chloride, alpha-bromobutyryl bromide and alpha-chloro-alpha-phenylacetyl chloride, respectively. Furthermore, I-IV were refluxed with ammonium thiocyanate to give 2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-thiazolidinones (V-VIII). V was refluxed with various aromatic aldehydes to give 5-arylidene-2-[(4-carbethoxymethylthiazol-2-yl)imino]-4-t hiazolidinones (IX-XIV). The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed by elemental analyses, hydrolysis, UV, IR, 1H-NMR and EI mass spectral data. The antimicrobial activities of the compounds were assessed by microbroth dilution technique using Mueller-Hinton broth and Mueller-Hinton Agar. In this study, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 4352, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 1539, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Proteus mirabilis and Candida albicans ATCC 10231 were used as test microorganisms. Among the tested compounds, XI and XIV showed activity against S. aureus (MIC: 78 micrograms/ml, 1.6 micrograms/ml), whereas compound V had an activity against S. flexneri (MIC: 39 micrograms/ml) and compound I against C. albicans (MIC: 125 (micrograms/ml). Compounds I, IV-XIV were also evaluated for antituberculosis activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using the BACTEC 460 radiometric system and BACTEC 12B medium. Only compounds I and XIV showed 86% and 67% inhibition in the primary screen.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of bacteria and HIV in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates (BC PCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC PCs in 35% CPD plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (PAS III) were exposed to photochemical treatment (PCT) with 150 microM of the psoralen S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). Platelet function was evaluated following PCT using a panel of in vitro assays. RESULTS: This PCT process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens). No viable bacteria were detected following PCT and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control BC PCs. Complete inactivation of the gram-positive Bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with BC PCs. PCT was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 in BC PCs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (TCID(50)/ml) of cell-associated HIV-1. Rapid inactivation was observed with increasing UVA doses: with 150 microM S-59 and a 1 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA. No physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control BC PCs during 7 days of storage. CONCLUSION: PCT with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) UVA treatment does not adversely affect in vitro properties of BC PCs stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. The PCT process inactivated bacteria and HIV-1 inoculated into the BC PCs. These results extend the earlier reported efficacy of PCT apheresis PCs to BC PCs.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Finnish plant extracts containing flavonoids and other phenolic compounds.
AB  - Plant phenolics, especially dietary flavonoids, are currently of growing interest owing to their supposed functional properties in promoting human health. Antimicrobial screening of 13 phenolic substances and 29 extracts prepared from Finnish plant materials against selected microbes was conducted in this study. The tests were carried out using diffusion methods with four to nine microbial species (Aspergillus niger, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis). Flavone, quercetin and naringenin were effective in inhibiting the growth of the organisms. The most active plant extracts were purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) against Candida albicans, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria (L.) Maxim.), willow herb (Epilobium angustifolium L.), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus L.) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) against bacteria, and white birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum. L.) against gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - Stimulation of bacterial adherence by neutrophil defensins varies among bacterial species but not among host cell types.
AB  - Adherence of Haemophilus influenzae to bronchial epithelial cells is enhanced by  neutrophil defensins, which are released from activated neutrophils during inflammation [Gorter et al. (1998) J. Infect. Dis. 178, 1067-1078]. In this study, we showed that the adherence of H. influenzae to various epithelial, fibroblast-like and endothelial cell types was significantly enhanced by defensins (20 microg ml(-1)). Defensins stimulated also the adherence of Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis and nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae to the NCI-H292 cell line. In contrast, defensins did not affect the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, encapsulated S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These results suggest that the defensin-enhanced adherence might support the adherence and possibly persistence of the selected bacterial species using the respiratory tract as port of entry.
TI  - Evaluation of biohazards in dehydrated biofilms on foodstuff packaging.
AB  - Plastic materials used for food packaging are clean but not sterile when the food is just packaged. Accidental wet contamination may occur at every moment between packaging and opening by the consumer: on polyethylene (PET), bacteria may adhere strongly and constitute a biofilm in less than 24 h. By rolling on themselves, PET sheets may contaminate food. We tried to show that contact with salted foodstuffs favoured microbial recovery. Four strains were chosen to perform biofilms on PET: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Biofilms were dried up 24 h. Biofilm bacteria were stressed by adhesion, by starvation and by dehydration. However, they were capable of recovery in salted solutions or media, probably because one (or more) stress protected them against another stress. Stress was demonstrated by stress protein production, by mean of electrophoresis, and membrane lesions by mean of flow cytometry. Stress recovery was performed in aqueous salted solutions or salted brain-heart infusion with NaCl 9, 15, 20 and 30 g/l. Staphylococci were more sensitive to these stresses and recovery was a function of salt concentration. Gram-negative bacteria were little affected by stresses; salt effects were less important. If all these biofilms were capable of recovery from stresses in salted media, flexible PET could possibly lead to a health hazard when it is used for wet salt meats, e.g.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and non-conventional antibiotics on bacteria.
AB  - The individual activity of antibiotics such as ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin in combination with compounds known to modify bacterial resistance to given antibiotics was studied using the checkerboard method. The combination of promethazine with either ampicillin, tetracycline or erythromycin or the combination of methylene blue and erythromycin produced significant synergistic activity against Escherichia coli. Verapamil, however, in combination with ampicillin reduced the activity of ampicillin against E. coli. Combinations of clomipramine with either tetracycline or erythromycin, promethazine and erythromycin or verapamil and ampicillin were synergistic against Staphylococcus epidermidis that was resistant to these antibiotics. The only synergy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown by the combination of methylene blue and gentamicin.
TI  - [The structure and antibiotic sensitivity of the causative agents of community-acquired infectious diseases of bacterial origin in children].
AB  - Four hundred and forty pediatric patients at the age of 7 days to 15 years with various infections admitted to the Hospital within a month were examined. The biological material was inoculated to blood agar on the first days of the patient admittance to the Hospital and after the growth the organisms were isolated and identified. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was assayed with the disk diffusion method. 479 strains in all were tested. The most frequent cases requiring hospitalization and antibiotic therapy were those of respiratory tract infections (54.09 per cent), urinary tract infections (26.36 per cent), cutaneous and subcutaneous fat diseases, gastrointestinal diseases and others (about 25 per cent of the cases in all). The main pathogens were Streptococcus viridans, S.aureus and S.epidermidis, as well as Enterobacteriaceae (chiefly E.coli) whose frequencies were practically equal (in 25-35 per cent of the cases). The Pneumococcus isolates amounted to 6.3 per cent. Nonfermenting bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter) and some representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (Citrobacter, Serratia, Morganella) were isolated from 7 per cent of the patients. The frequency of Klebsiella and Enterobacter was about 11 per cent. The main pathogens were tested for their susceptibility to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, oxacillin and gentamicin. The least active antibiotic was ampicillin. 88.8 per cent of the E.coli isolates and 100 per cent of the Klebsiella, P.mirabilis, Morganella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Serratia isolates were resistant to it. 53.2 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates including 64.5 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates were as well resistant to ampicillin. 59.5 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates (mainly S.viridans and Enterococcus) was susceptible to oxacillin, 22.2 per cent of them being moderately susceptible. 62.5 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates and 78.1 per cent of the Staphylococcus isolates were also susceptible to oxacillin. The highest susceptibility of the isolates was that to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, i.e. 90.1 per cent of the strains, 79.9 per cent of them being highly susceptible. All the isolates of Citrobacter, Serratia and Morganella and some isolates of P.aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and E.coli were resistant to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid. As for the latter 5 organisms their susceptibility to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was comparable with that to gentamicin. The susceptibility of the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus isolates to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid was significantly much higher than that to oxacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin: 93 per cent of the Streptococcus isolates (62.7 per cent of the Pneumococcus isolates) and 90.7 per cent of the Staphylococcus isolates.
TI  - [Advantages and disadvantages in the use of central venous catheters in children  with malignant diseases].
AB  - The authors report the problem of central venous catheter appliance to the children with malignant diseases, employed for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the aim of pediatric oncologic patients treatment. During 1997 central venous catheter type Hickman was used in nine children between two and half to eleven years old (average six years and one months). The average time of catheter placement was six months, in two cases catheter were eliminated after two and three months respectively since application (spontaneous elimination and repeated septic attacks, caused bu resistant bacterial strains). Gram-positive bacteria have been isolated with eight children (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), and gram-negative enterobacteriaceae (Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytocia and pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Enterococcus faecalis) in samples taken from the catheter and hemoculture. The central venous catheter is useful in treating oncological patients, but may cause serious consequences, like local infections or septicaemia.
TI  - The effects of chlorhexidine irrigation solution on contaminated bone-tendon allografts.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine an expedient and effective method for  disinfecting contaminated human bone-tendon allografts. The first part of this study used beef muscle and cadaveric human tissues to determine the most effective solution and volume to decontaminate tissues inoculated with four different organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Of the solutions tested (benzalkonium chloride, castile soap, castile soap followed by benzalkonium chloride, triple antibiotic, chlorhexidine gluconate, and chlorhexidine gluconate/triple antibiotic), only the 4% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution and 4% chlorhexidine/triple antibiotic bath completely disinfected all tissues. Work in part 2 revealed that a 2% chlorhexidine irrigation solution was equally effective as the 4% solutions. Part 3 of the study involved human Achilles tendon-calcaneus allografts. We found similar results: 3 liters of 2% chlorhexidine power irrigation solution thoroughly removed all microorganisms from the contaminated tissues. All control allografts irrigated with normal saline solution alone revealed positive bacterial growth for all four organisms after 72 hours' growth on sheep blood agar. Total decontamination time was 10 to 12 minutes. Two percent chlorhexidine irrigation solution may be an effective method for decontaminating human bone-tendon allografts challenged with a polymicrobial inoculum. This method of disinfecting bone-tendon allografts is at least five times more expeditious than methods in previously reported studies.
TI  - [In vitro activities of levofloxacin and other antibiotics against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In this study, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin (LVFX) against 1,020 fresh bacterial clinical isolates was compared with the activities of a range of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), ampicillin (ABPC), cefaclor, cefpodoxime, methicillin and benzylpenicillin. The clinical isolates except Vibrio cholerae were collected in Japan during 1998 from patients with infectious diseases. MICs were determined using the agar dilution method according to the recommendations by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. Some isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were resistant to fluoroquinolones, but the MIC50 of LVFX against MRSA was 6.25 micrograms/ml. LVFX was the most active against MRSA among the antibiotics tested. Most of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. LVFX showed greater activity against all streptococci strains compared with fluoroquinolones tested. In particular, all Streptococcus pneumoniae strains including PRSP were susceptible to LVFX at < or = 1.56 micrograms/ml. Among Enterococcus, ABPC showed superior activity against Enterococcus faecalis but many isolates of Enterococcus species were resistant to ABPC. LVFX was more active against to these Enterococcus species compared with other fluoroquinolones. On the other hand, LVFX and CPFX showed similar activity against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. CPFX had an MIC50/90 of 0.20, 0.39 microgram/ml and LVFX showed an MIC50/90 of 0.78, 1.56 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. LVFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.20 microgram/ml) was more active against Acinetobacter species than CPFX (MIC50/90 0.10, 0.39 microgram/ml). Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis and V. cholerae were inhibited by low concentration of the fluoroquinolones tested. The MIC90 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.10 microgram/ml against above three species. Some isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Campylobacter species were moderately resistant to the fluoroquinolones tested but the MIC50 of LVFX and CPFX were < or = 0.39 microgram/ml. Among anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes was more susceptible than Peptostreptococcus species, and the MIC90 of beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones tested were < or = 0.78 microgram/ml. In conclusion, this study, performed on large number of strains, confirmed an excellent and wide spectrum antibacterial activity of LVFX compared with the fluoroquinolones and beta-lactams tested. And our results suggest that LVFX may be useful in the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Changing pattern of infection in the Bratislava Burn Center.
AB  - Infection still remains one of the major problems in burn treatment. The authors  investigated the occurrence of burn wound pathogens in burn wound biopsies and/or semiquantitative wound surface off-prints. As the results have shown, trends of a decreased contribution of "classical pathogens", like Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to burn wound infections were observed. The role of "other pathogens", like Enterobacter, Acinetobacter, etc., which were quite rare in the past, is on the opposite, increasing. One of the explanations can be the increasing rate of early surgical treatment methods of deep burns. The results were in accordance with similar studies from other burn centres.
TI  - Target site concentrations after continuous infusion and bolus injection of cefpirome to healthy volunteers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent data indicate a higher level of effectivity of beta-lactam antibiotics if serum concentrations are kept above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the pathogen. This concept would favor continuous infusion over bolus dosing. However, it is usually not the serum concentration but the free interstitial concentration in the target tissue that determines antibiotic activity. We therefore set out to measure effective drug concentrations in the interstitial space of muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue and to compare trough levels and times above the MIC after bolus versus continuous infusion of cefpirome. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers received a single dose of 2 g cefpirome as an intravenous bolus or as a continuous infusion over 8 hours in a crossover design, and the resulting free interstitial tissue concentrations were measured with use of microdialysis. RESULTS: After bolus injection, mean interstitial trough concentrations were 3.0 +/- 1.9 microg/mL and 2.1 +/-1.0 microg/mL for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively; continuous infusion resulted in trough levels of 10.1 +/- 6.8 microg/mL and 10.1 +/- 4.6 microg/mL for muscle and subcutaneous tissue, respectively. This resulted in significantly longer times above the MIC with continuous infusion for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae. Bacteria with an MIC < or =1 would be covered by either method, whereas higher doses seem to be necessary for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Although susceptible organisms will usually be covered sufficiently with standard dosing regimens, soft tissue infections with bacteria that have MIC values of 2 to 8 may profit from continuous application. Coverage of P aeruginosa, however, would be inadequate with conventional daily doses of 4 g cefpirome regardless of the method of application.
TI  - Safety and cleaning of medical materials and devices.
AB  - A study was undertaken to evaluate different procedures to safely remove microorganisms, protein, and mammalian cells from materials and provide a suitable method for cleaning and assessing effectiveness of cleaning medical devices for reuse or for analysis of failure. Safety considerations for the personnel performing the cleaning or handling the device after cleaning are important issues. Polystyrene plates (96 well) were used to simulate device surfaces not amenable to manual scrubbing. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and oral flora were grown in the plates. The plates were stained with crystal violet and the optical densities recorded. The results indicated that E. coli did not adhere well and Pseudomonas formed clumps that were easily detached from the surface of the plates. However, S. epi, C. albicans, and the oral organisms formed adherent biofilms that were difficult to remove from the plates. Detergents with enzymes and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) bleach were both effective in removing the biofilm. Other detergents and surfactants were not effective. The aldehyde agents did not remove the organisms and made further cleaning difficult. Allowing the biofilm to dry first made cleaning very difficult. Only the NaOCl bleach could subsequently remove the dried or aldehyde fixed organisms from the wells. The same 96-well polystyrene plate format was used to measure the amount of protein and cell adherence as well as the effectiveness of subsequent cleaning. Bradford reagent was used to detect protein as a measure of the cleaning efficacy. As with the bacteria, NaOCl bleach was effective at removing the protein and cells that had been dried or fixed by formalin or alcohol, whereas detergent with enzymes was not very effective. This study confirmed that used medical devices, contaminated with microorganisms, protein, and/or mammalian cells, should not be allowed to dry before cleaning and that a thorough cleaning procedure should precede sterilization or disinfection (with the exception of NaOCl bleach which also cleans).
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - Extended wear contact lens related bacterial keratitis.
AB  - AIMS: To report the clinical findings and visual outcome of patients with extended wear contact lens (EWCL) related bacterial keratitis. METHODS: 11 cases with EWCL related bacterial keratitis were included. Corneal scrapings were obtained for cytology and cultures. RESULTS: Nine patients had unilateral bacterial keratitis and two patients showed bilateral involvement. Corneal scrapings revealed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in seven patients, Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive in one patient, and Staphylococcus epidermidis in three patients. CONCLUSION: EWCLs may be associated with bacterial keratitis and may result in visual loss. Dispensing contact lenses by optometrists should be performed in consultation with ophthalmologists.
TI  - [Antiviral and antibacterial actions of bingduqing granules in vitro].
AB  - The antiviral and antibacterial actions in vitro of bingduqing granules which consists of nine kinds of Chinese traditional medicinal herbs were observed. The results showed that the inhibitive concentrations of bingduqing granules for Adv-7, RSV, HSV-1, and influenza virus A3, were >-6.9, 8.3, 13.8 and 83 mg x ml-1, respectively; while the minimum inhibitive concentrations for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Type A and B Streptococci, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.03125, 0.03125, 0.125, 0.125, and 0.25 g x ml-1, respectively. This study provide a pharmacodynamics basis for clinical application of Bingduqing Granules in the treatment of respiratory tract infection.
TI  - Initial adhesion and surface growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on biomedical polymers.
AB  - The infection risk of biomaterials implants varies between different materials and is determined by an interplay of adhesion and surface growth of the infecting organisms. In this study, we compared initial adhesion and surface growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis HBH(2) 102 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AK1 on poly(dimethylsiloxane), Teflon, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(methyl methacrylate), and glass. Initial adhesion was measured in situ in a parallel plate flow chamber with microorganisms suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, while subsequent surface growth was followed in full and in 20 times diluted growth medium. Initial adhesion of both bacterial strains was similar to all biomaterials. In full growth medium, generation times of surface growing S. epidermidis ranged from 17 to 38 min with no relation to wettability, while in diluted growth medium generation times increased from 44 to 98 min with increasing surface wettability. For P. aeruginosa no influence of surface wettability on generation times was observed, but generation times increased with decreasing desorption rates, maximal generation times being 47 min and minimal values down to 30 min. Generally, generation times of adhering bacteria were shorter than of planktonic bacteria. In conclusion, surface growth of initially adhering bacteria is influenced by biomaterials surface properties to a greater extent than initial adhesion.
TI  - Epidemiology and microbiology of surgical wound infections.
AB  - This study included 676 surgery patients with signs and symptoms indicative of wound infections, who presented over the course of 6 years. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 614 individuals. A single etiologic agent was identified in 271 patients, multiple agents were found in 343, and no agent was identified in 62. A high preponderance of aerobic bacteria was observed. Among the common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (191 patients, 28.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (170 patients, 25.2%), Escherichia coli (53 patients, 7.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (48 patients, 7.1%), and Enterococcus faecalis (38 patients, 5.6%).
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis with topical lomefloxacin 0.3% compared to topical ofloxacin 0.3%.
AB  - PURPOSE: The main purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy,  local tolerance, and safety of topical lomefloxacin 0.3% and topical ofloxacin 0.3% in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis were included in a randomized, prospective, parallel-group study. Twenty patients were assigned to the lomefloxacin group (Okacin, CIBA Vision Ophthalmics) and 20 patients to ofloxacin (Oflox, Allergan). Lomefloxacin 0.3% was given 1 drop every 2 hours during waking hours on the first day then twice daily for one week. Ofloxacin 0.3% eyedrops were given four times daily. All patients underwent eye examination and clinical findings were graded and recorded according to severity of lid hyperemia, lid edema, lid crusting, conjunctival edema and discharge, bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, palpebral conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, and ocular discomfort. The score for each clinical sign was recorded before and after treatment. The mean cumulative sum score (CSS) was obtained by adding the scores for signs and symptoms. All conjunctival swabs were cultured and tested for sensitivity. Patients with confirmed bacterial conjunctivitis were included. RESULTS: There were 10 male and 10 female patients in each group. The age range was from 1 to 78 years, and the mean age was 35 years in the lomefloxacin group. In the ofloxacin group the age range was from 1 to 70 years, and the mean age was 26 years. There was no significant difference between the two groups in relation to age or sex. The causative organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 16 cases (36%), alpha-hemolytic Streptococci in 9 (20%), Haemophilus spp. 6 (13%), Staphylococcus aureus 5 (11%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 4 (9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 (7%), and other 2 (4%). The mean CSS for conjunctivitis was 12.1 before therapy in the lomefloxacin group and 12.7 in the ofloxacin group. On the 7th day of therapy, the mean CSS was 0.7 in the lomefloxacin group, and 1.6 for ofloxacin. All patients showed improvement, but a total of 18 out of 20 (88%) in the lomefloxacin group showed complete resolution compared to 15 (75%) in the ofloxacin group. The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Tolerance was excellent in both groups, and no side effects were reported. A burning sensation was noted by two patients, one in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Lomefloxacin and ofloxacin were equally effective and safe in the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Recurrent infection and catheter loss in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the factors leading to catheter loss from recurrent infection in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). DESIGN: All catheters removed from patients were prospectively examined for infection. SETTING: CAPD unit in large tertiary-care general hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing catheter removal for whatever cause; 20 catheters rejected because of desiccation or contamination in transit. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Micro-organisms linked to catheter removal; their locations on removed catheters. RESULTS: Of 45 catheters removed between January 1994 and August 1995, 26 were infected: 13/26 infections were caused by Staphylococcus aureus and 7/26 by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In only one case was S. epidermidis associated with catheter removal. The most striking finding was that the inner cuff harbored large numbers of the infecting organisms, even when antibiotics had eradicated them from the peritoneal cavity and exit site, where present, and the catheter lumen. CONCLUSION: The importance of S. aureus and Ps. aeruginosa rather than S. epidermidis in catheter loss due to relapsing infection is confirmed. Persistence of the causative organisms in the inner cuff is a likely explanation for relapse after treatment, and might be due to the predominantly intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics. A clinical trial of the effect on catheter retention of empirical use of systemic or oral agents that give high tissue levels and are active against intracellular micro-organisms, along with recommended intraperitoneal regimens, is indicated.
TI  - Optimizing breast pocket irrigation: an in vitro study and clinical implications.
AB  - Subclinical infections have been implicated in the etiology of capsular contracture. Intraoperatively, breast pocket irrigation with povidone-iodine or other antibiotic solutions has been popularized; however, detrimental effects on wound healing for these agents have been reported and their efficacy against common organisms found around breast implants has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and two double antibiotic solutions DAB-1 (gentamicin/polymyxin B) and DAB-2 (gentamicin/cefazolin), against organisms most commonly found around breast implants. In phase I trials, serial dilutions of povidone-iodine and DAB were combined 1:1 with cultures of five common organisms found around implants. In phase II, povidone-iodine was serially diluted in DAB-1 rather than saline. In phase III, povidone-iodine was serially diluted with DAB-2. Efficacy for all phases was determined by plating the mixture onto agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Povidone-iodine was 100 percent effective at a dilution of 12.5% against Staphylococcus epidermidis and 25% against Staphylococcus aureus but relatively ineffective against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas, DAB-1 was found to be ineffective against S. epidermidis but effective against S. aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, E. coli, and Pseudomonas. In phase II trials, a concentration of 12.5% povidone-iodine in DAB was effective at killing all experimental bacteria. In phase III trials, 10% povidone-iodine in DAB-2 was effective at killing all bacteria tested. In conclusion, to maximize bacterial control of common breast implant organisms and to minimize the detrimental effects on wound healing, 10% povidone-iodine in gentamycin/cefazolin may be used with excellent results and its use clinically may reduce the incidence of capsular contracture.
TI  - Antibacterial steroid alkaloids from the stem bark of Holarrhena pubescens.
AB  - Holarrhena pubescens (syn. H. antidysenterica) (L.) WALL. stem bark was tested for antibacterial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the microdilution broth method as well as the disc diffusion method. The crude methanolic extract was active against all tested bacteria. Further chemical fractionation indicated that the antibacterial activity was mainly associated with the alkaloids. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined for the crude extract, the total alkaloids and the neutral fraction using microdilution broth method. The results were compared with reference antibiotics. The total alkaloids showed remarkable activity against S. aureus (MIC = 95 microg/ml).
TI  - Antimicrobial mixtures used to store harvested skin: antimicrobial activities tested at refrigerator (4 degrees C) temperatures.
AB  - Tissue culture media used by skin and tissue banks to store tissue were tested, with and without antimicrobial mixtures, for their ability to inhibit the growth of bacteria during incubation at refrigerator temperatures. Reductions in bacterial load were found after incubation at 4 degrees C in both the basal tissue culture media with and without the addition of antimicrobial mixtures. The presence of antimicrobials enhanced the degree and rapidity of reduction. Variations occurred among the different formulations, with or without added antimicrobials. No one formulation for either the basal tissue culture medium or antimicrobial mixture was ideal. Methods described in this study can be used to establish optimum basal medium and antimicrobial mixture formulations for general use by skin and tissue banks.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - Risk factors associated with early-onset sepsis in premature infants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define perinatal factors associated with early-onset neonatal sepsis. STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and neonatal variables were analysed retrospectively in 343 infants born before 35 weeks using univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis identified risk factors for probable neonatal sepsis: gestational age at delivery (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-0.96), premature rupture of the membranes (odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.004-8.56), Apgar score after 1 min (odds ratio 0.7, 95% CI 0.53-0.96), and histological chorioamnionitis and/or funisitis (odds ratio 4.1, 95% CI 1.36-12.12). There was a strong association between probable sepsis and intracranial haemorrhage of the infant (odds ratio 4.3, 95% CI 1.07-17.40). Funisitis had a high specificity (91%) and positive predictive value (82%) for the detection of neonatal sepsis < or =32 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Independent obstetrical risk factors for early-onset neonatal sepsis in premature infants may help to identify newborns who benefit from maternal antibiotic prophylaxis before birth. The histological examination of the umbilical cord can be used as an additional diagnostic test to detect newborns at risk of infection.
TI  - Reassessment of the routine anaerobic culture and incubation time in the BacT/Alert FAN blood culture bottles.
AB  - A total of 9,130 blood cultures were collected from adult patients with suspected bloodstream infections. The recommended 20 mL sample of blood was divided equally between the aerobic and anaerobic FAN bottles and monitored in the BacT/Alert Microbial Detection System for a total of 5 days. There were 757 clinically significant positive culture pairs from 291 patients. Significant differences were found with greater recovery of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p < 0.001), Acinetobacter spp. (p = 0.002), coagulase-negative staphylococci other than Staphylococcus epidermidis (p = 0.002), and Candida spp. (p < 0.001) from the aerobic bottle and greater recovery of anaerobic bacteria (p < 0.001) from the anaerobic bottle. Significantly more episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia (p < 0.003) and candidemia (p < 0.001) were detected by the aerobic FAN bottle and significantly more episodes of anaerobic bacteremia (p < 0.001) were detected by the anaerobic FAN bottle (Table 2). No other significant differences between systems in their detection of bacteremias were noted. Anaerobic bacteremias were encountered in diverse and often unpredictable clinical settings. All clinically significant episodes of bloodstream infection were detected within 4 days of incubation of their cultures. We conclude routine, rather than selective, use of the anaerobic FAN bottle in the blood culture set and a 4-day incubation of blood cultures in the BacT/Alert aerobic and anaerobic FAN bottles is an appropriate routine procedure.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo models of bacterial biofilms.
AB  
TI  - The spectrum of bacterial infections in febrile neutropenic patients: effect on empiric antibiotic therapy.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective analysis was to look at the spectrum of bacterial isolates and their resistance patterns to the commonly used antibiotics in the setting of febrile neutropenia. A total of 127 bacteria were isolated from patients with acute leukemias, lymphoproliferative disorders, aplastic anaemia and various solid tumours. Fifty-four percent organisms were gram negative; while the rest were gram positive. E. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus and streptococci were the commonly isolated organisms. Forty-eight percent organisms were isolated from blood, 16% from urine, 13% from wounds and superficial abscesses and 11% from respiratory tract. E. coli exhibited a great degree of resistance to the commonly used antibiotics, such as pipericillin (70%), ofloxacin (50%) and aztreonam (50%). Pseudomonas and klebsiella also showed varying degree of resistance against the antibiotics. Staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were almost universally resistant to penicillin and showed a variable degree of resistance to other antibiotics too. Compared to the previous reports, the pattern of bacterial isolates and their resistance to antibiotics has changed over the past years. Aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins seem to be the choice of antibiotics for the upfront management of febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - The effect of water, ascorbic acid, and cranberry derived supplementation on human urine and uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber.
AB  - In this study, urine was collected from groups of volunteers following the consumption of water, ascorbic acid, or cranberry supplements. Only ascorbic acid intake consistently produced acidic urine. Photospectroscopy data indicated that increased water consumption produced urine with lower protein content. Surface tension measurements of the collected urine showed that both water and cranberry supplementation consistently produced urine with surface tensions higher than the control or urine collected following ascorbic acid intake. These urine samples were also employed to study uropathogen adhesion to silicone rubber in a parallel plate flow chamber. Urine obtained after ascorbic acid or cranberry supplementation reduced the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Candida albicans. Conversely, urine obtained from subjects with increased water intake vastly increased the initial deposition rates and numbers of adherent E. coli and E. faecalis (P < 0.05).
TI  - Inflammatory response in experimental Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas endophthalmitis.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis [2.0 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFU)/0. 1 ml] and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.0 x 10(3) CFU/ml) were inoculated in the vitreous humor of rabbits. In S. epidermidis endophthalmitis, the numbers of microorganisms reached a maximum (4. 1 x 10(7) CFU/ml) at day 2 after inoculation and then declined spontaneously. However, clinical scores were observed to be worst at day 5. In P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis, the numbers of microorganisms reached a maximum (9.3 x 10(6) CFU/ml) 36 h after inoculation. However, culture results were persistently positive until day 15. Electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave amplitudes in S. epidermidis endophthalmitis continued to decrease from day 3 (>24%) until day 5, and then recovered to the preinoculative level of amplitudes at day 7. ERG b-wave amplitudes in P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis continued to decrease after 24 h (>24%). ERG b-wave amplitudes from day 7 to day 15 were flat. The inflammatory response continued under the absence of microorganisms in S. epidermidis endophthalmitis. The time in which a maximum in the number of microorganisms was reached was earlier than that in the clinical examination scores in both S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - Bacterial invasion of corneal epithelial cells.
AB  - PURPOSE: The normal ocular surface is frequently colonized by commensal gram-positive species. Gram-negative bacteria are often implicated in corneal infection and inflammation, particularly in association with soft contact lens wear. The aim of this study was to elucidate possible mechanisms of virulence in ocular bacteria. METHODS: The susceptibility of a human corneal epithelial cell line to bacterial invasion and association was evaluated using the gentamicin exclusion assay. Organisms tested included isolates from corneal ulcers, corneal inflammation and ocular sites in asymptomatic individuals. RESULTS: The commensal, non-pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus epidermidis and some pathogenic strains of Serratia marcescens did not invade corneal epithelial cells. In contrast, pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa associated with and invaded corneal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The increased association of P. aeruginosa, compared to other bacterial types, might be a reason for the more frequent association of this bacterium with contact-lens-associated microbial keratitis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis. Microbiological analysis as a principle for therapeutic recommendations].
AB  - PURPOSE: The study presented differentiates between the aetiological agents of bacterial keratitis in patients with and without a history of contact lens wear. Based on these results, recommendations are given for optimal antibiotic primary therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Swabs and corneal scrapings were taken from 218 patients referred to the University Eye Hospital in Munich with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis from 1989 to 1997. Ninety-two of these patients had a history of contact lens wear; 126 had none. The germs were isolated and identified by staining and microscopy. Observing polymicrobial growth in 51 patients, a total of 275 germs was isolated. RESULTS: The most frequent pathogens were Staphylococcus epidermidis (44%), S. aureus (18%), Streptococcus spp. (10%), Propionibacterium acnes (7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). Gram-negative germs were nearly exclusively isolated from contact lens wearers, gram-positive germs were predominant in non-contact lens wearers. CONCLUSION: Keratitis in patients with a history of contact lens wear is often caused by aggressive gram-negative germs. Those cases should immediately be treated with quinolones and erythromycin. In keratitis caused by gram-positive pathogens, a combination with aminoglycosides and erythromycin is sufficient.
TI  - In vitro viability of external eye microbial flora in hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose.
AB  - The aim of this study was to verify the in vitro influence of various dilutions of a viscoelastic substance containing 2% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose (HPMC) on the viability of some microbial strains representative of the normal flora of the external eye. Pure reference strain cultures of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and a fresh clinical isolate of Proteus mirabilis were selected for this study. Serial twofold dilutions of 2% HPMC, prepared so as to obtain a final concentration ranging from 50 to 0.78% of the product in sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl), were taken out with a pipette that delivered 1.0 ml per tube. One hundred microliters of the abovementioned microbial inocula, used for the evaluation of the positive control of the test organism, were dispensed into each tube. After 24 h of incubation, 100 microl of samples were taken from each tube and plated into the specific medium for the growth of the test organism. After 24-48 h of incubation, these agar plates were examined and the colony-forming-unit count of each test organism was compared to the corresponding total colony count, acting as a positive control, in order to determine the quantitative variation of the test organism grown in the presence of the viscoelastic compounds. C. albicans and P. aeruginosa showed a statistically significant increase in growth with HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:16. P. acnes and P. mirabilis growth was significantly reduced by all dilutions except for the 1:128 one. S. epidermidis growth was also significantly reduced in the presence of HPMC dilutions varying from 1:2 to 1:64. S. aureus growth was not significantly influenced. The viability of P. aeruginosa in HPMC dilutions needs to be carefully considered because of the ability of this organism to induce endophthalmitis, and the possibility that during cataract surgery, a small amount of HPMC may be left in the eye, trapped behind the intraocular lens optic.
TI  - [Bacterial keratitis in patients with and without contact lens anamnesis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study shows differences between contact lens wearers and patients without history of contact lenses regarding the spectrum of etiological agents in bacterial keratitis. Based on microbiological analysis, there are given recommendations for an optimal initial antibiotic treatment in both groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1989 to 1997 smears, scrapings and corneal biopsies were taken from 218 patients with bacterial keratitis. The causing pathogens were isolated on directly inoculated culture media and identified by staining and microscopy. The resistance pattern of a total of 275 germs was analysed for different antibiotics. RESULTS: The most frequently isolated germs were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Whereas sensitive gram-positive germs were predominating in contact lens wearers as well as in non-contact lens wearers, multiresistant gram-negative germs could nearly exclusively be isolated from contact lens wearers. Frequently administered antibiotics like aminoglycosides and quinolones are effective in infections caused by Staphylococcus spp., but increasing resistance could be seen to Streptococcus spp. In this case, erythromycin is very sensitive. Gram-negative germs like Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sensitive to quinolones and some aminoglycosides (e.g. tobramycin). CONCLUSION: In contact lens wearers, more aggressive germs have to be considered than in non-contact lens wearers. In such cases, frequently administered antibiotics like amino-glycosides are not effective. To cover problematic gram-negative germs we recommend the application of quinolones alternating with erythromycin. The latter one is more effective than quinolones and aminoglycosides in case of Streptococcus spp. co-involvement.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Feglymycin, a novel inhibitor of the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus. Fermentation, isolation and structure elucidation.
AB  - The novel peptide feglymycin has been isolated from cultures of Streptomyces sp.  DSM 11171 by solid phase extraction, size exclusion chromatography and repeated reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular weight was found to be 1900.90 g/mol and the molecular formula is C95H97Nl3O30. Feglymycin contains 13 amino acids of which four are 3-hydroxyphenylglycine and five are 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine residues. The structure of the linear peptide has been determined by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The sequence was confirmed by the observed mass spectroscopic fragmentation pattern. As well as having weak antibacterial activity, feglymycin inhibits the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro.
TI  - Prolonged leaching time of peptide antibiotics from acrylic bone cement.
AB  - The leaching time of antibiotics in growth inhibitory concentrations from polyacrylic bone cements was determined using Escherichia coli, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as target bacteria. The leaching time of the peptide antibiotics vancomycin and polymyxin B nonapeptide was considerably longer than that of gentamicin, novobiocin, and erythromycin. Among the nonpeptide antibiotics, the leaching time of novobiocin lasted longer than did that of gentamicin. The acylated parent polymyxin B antibiotic leached for a considerably shorter period than did the deacylated polymyxin B nonapeptide derivative, suggesting that the lipids impede the leaching process from the cement. Cement beads impregnated with polymyxin B nonapeptide and introduced into the tibia of three rabbits receiving oral novobiocin protected bone infection against a challenge of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that otherwise caused infection in tibias containing gentamicin impregnated cement beads. The peptide antibiotics alone or in combination with other antibiotics (polymyxin B nonapeptide and novobiocin) impregnated in cements for orthopaedic procedures may provide longer periods of protection against a wide range of bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Wedelia trilobata crude extracts.
AB  - A biological screening of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi of crude extracts from Wedelia trilobata is reported. The n-hexane extract showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis (Gram-positive bacteria); along with Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella group C, Salmonella paratyphi, and Shigella sonnei (Gram-negative bacteria). The ethyl acetate extract was active only against Salmonella group C; and the aqueous extract was inactive against the tested bacteria. None of the tested extracts showed biological activity against the yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra) or the fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp., Trichophyton rubrum).
TI  - Screening of medicinal plants from Trinidad and Tobago for antimicrobial and insecticidal properties.
AB  - Antibacterial activity in 51 extracts from 29 plant species currently used in traditional medicine in Trinidad and the neighbouring Caribbean islands was tested for by the agar dilution streak method using six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Salmonella tophimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extracts from eight of the plants tested showed significant activity against one or more micro-organisms and the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus. In the bioassays for toxicity towards the Aedes aegypti mosquito the most effective plant extracts were from Justicia pectoralis, Manihot utilissima and Stachytarpheta jamaicensis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT antimicrobial barrier dressing.
AB  - This study evaluated the antimicrobial activity of ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing (Westaim Biomedical Corp, Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada), a silver-coated wound dressing, and compared it with silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and mafenide acetate. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC), zone of inhibition, and killing curves were determined with 5 clinically relevant bacteria. The data indicate that ACTICOAT silver had the lowest MIC and MBC and generated similar zones of inhibition to silver nitrate and silver sulfadiazine. Viable bacteria were undetectable 30 minutes after inoculation with the dressing, whereas it took 2 to 4 hours for silver nitrate and silver sulfadazine to achieve the same result. Mafenide acetate generated the biggest zones of inhibition, but it had the highest MICs and MBCs, and a significant number of bacteria still survived after 6 hours of treatment. The results suggest that ACTICOAT Antimicrobial Barrier Dressing has better antimicrobial performance than either of the existing silver-based products. ACTICOAT dressing killed the bacteria that were tested much faster, which is a very important characteristic for a wound dressing acting as a barrier to invasive infection to have. The study also suggests that a single susceptibility test such as a MIC or zone of inhibition test does not provide a comprehensive profile of antimicrobial activity of a topical antimicrobial agent or dressing. A combination of tests is desirable.
TI  - Defective self-reactive antibody repertoire of serum IgM in patients with hyper-IgM syndrome.
AB  - We have analyzed the self-reactive repertoires of IgM and IgG Abs in the serum of 19 patients with hyper-IgM syndrome (HIM) by means of a quantitative immunoblotting technique that allows for a quantitative comparison of Ab repertoires in health and disease by multiparametric statistical analysis. Normal tissue extracts of liver, lung, stomach, and kidney were used as sources of self Ags. Extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were used as sources of nonself Ags. We demonstrate a significant bias in repertoires of reactivities of IgM of patients with HIM with self Ags. Ab repertoires of IgM toward nonself Ags did not differ, however, between patients and controls. No difference was found between IgM repertoires of untreated patients and those of patients receiving substitutive treatment with i.v. IgG. IgG in the serum of HIM patients lacked reactivity with self Ags, although it exhibited a pattern of reactivity with nonself Ags that was similar to that of IgG of healthy controls. The data demonstrate that functional CD40-CD40 ligand interactions are essential for the selection of natural self-reactive B cell repertoires.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of silicone oil against endophthalmitis-causing agents in vitro. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of silicone oil was tested on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus spp. The bacteria and fungi were separately inoculated into 1,300 centistokes silicone oil. Control inoculations were done in two different media: physiologic saline and brain-heart infusion (BHI) for bacteria and Sabouraud broth and physiologic saline for fungi. From each medium, 0.001-mL samples were taken and plated in Petri dishes. After overnight incubation, colony-forming units (CFUs) were enumerated. Culturing from the initially prepared specimens, incubating overnight, and counting CFUs was repeated until no growth of microorganisms was seen in the silicone oil-containing media. Macroscopic photography of the colonies and light microscopic photography of microorganisms were performed. RESULTS: All the microorganisms showed an apparent decrease in CFUs, with elimination between 7 and 21 days in silicone oil. Colony-forming units of microorganisms remained stable in physiologic saline during the study, with the exception of gradual decrease in CFUs of S. aureus and S. epidermidis from the beginning of the third day. In BHI and Sabouraud broth, both bacteria and fungi showed a growth pattern that was compatible with the growth curve of microorganisms. CONCLUSION: Silicone oil has an antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, and Aspergillus spp., which are common endophthalmitis-causing agents.
TI  - [Use of pefloxacin in the treatment of patients with purulent wounds of soft tissues].
AB  - Pefloxacin was used in the treatment of 25 patients with wound infection in a dose of 400 mg orally twice a day for 10-12 days. As the monotherapy it was applied to 15 patients. 7 patients with clinical signs of non-clostridial anaerobic infection were treated with pefloxacin in combination with intravenous metronidazole. Pefloxacin was highly efficient in 96 per cent of the cases with extensive posttraumatic purulent wounds with and without bone affection, acute purulent wounds of the soft tissue, purulent wounds of the soft tissues in diabetic patients, trophic or decubitus ulcer. 266 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter spp. and Acinetobacter spp, were tested and 75 to 100 per cent of them was shown to be susceptible to pefloxacin and ciprofloxacin. At the same time the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin. The pathogen eradication and eradication with superinfection in the cases treated with pefloxacin amounted to 92 per cent. The drug tolerance was good. No clinically significant adverse events were recorded.
TI  - Pacemaker-related endocarditis. Report of 7 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We report on 7 patients with pacemaker endocarditis diagnosed during the workup of long-standing fever. Persistent positive blood cultures and echocardiography led to the diagnosis in 6 patients whereas autopsy was diagnostic in another. Causative microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Streptococcus bovis (1), and Streptococcus mitis-Streptococcus sanguis (1). Pulmonary embolism was present in nearly 50% of the cases, a figure clearly higher than previously reported. In all but 1 case the initial medical approach was not successful, and thus the pacing system was finally removed. None of the cases relapsed after the removal. We have reviewed the literature regarding pacemaker endocarditis, particularly with respect to treatment.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - Penetration of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin into the aqueous humor using different topical application modes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prospective study was undertaken to determine the transcorneal penetration of three topically applied fluoroquinolones into aqueous humor. METHODS: Cataract patients (n = 224) preoperatively received topically applied gyrase inhibitors (0.3% ciprofloxacin, 0.3% norfloxacin, 0.3% ofloxacin) in two different application modes. In application mode I, patients received on the day before operation 3 x 1 eye drop at 2-h intervals, and on the day of operation 3 drops at 1-h intervals. In application mode II, patients received 9 drops at 15-min intervals on the day of operation only. Just before cataract surgery 50-100 ml aqueous humor was aspirated and stored at -80 degrees C. The HPLC method was used for measuring the concentration. RESULTS: The highest concentrations of all tested antibiotics were measured after the mode of application in which one drop was given every 15 min between 06:00 and 08:00 hours before operation. In this mode, ciprofloxacin achieved a mean aqueous level of 379.8 +/- 327.8 mg/l (range 33-1388 mg/l), norfloxacin 182.1 +/- 118.1 mg/l (range 38-480 mg/l) and ofloxacin 563.9 +/- 372.1 mg/l (range 64-1455 mg/l). These mean concentration are all above the MIC90 of gram-negative bacteria like Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli. In some cases the concentrations of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, but never norfloxacin, reached therapeutic values above the MIC90 of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. CONCLUSIONS: The mean concentration value of 0.3% ciprofloxacin and of 0.3% ofloxacin in the aqueous humor reached the MIC90 values of the frequently occurring gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Of the currently available topical fluoroquinolones, ofloxacin achieved the highest aqueous humor concentration. Considering the higher antimicrobial activity of ciprofloxacin, both ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin may be useful ophthalmic agents in antibacterial management, but they are not efficient against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Performance evaluation of disinfectant formulations using poloxamer-hydrogel biofilm-constructs.
AB  - Poloxamer F127 is a di-block co-polymer of polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene.  Aqueous solutions show thermo-reversible gelation, being liquid at temperatures < 15 degrees C and robust gels at temperatures > 15 degrees C. Chilled poloxamer solutions (30% w/v) were inoculated with approximately 10(4-5) cfu ml-1 of stationary phase cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Ps. fluorescens, Pantoea agglomerans, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis or Listeria innocua. Drops (200 microliters) of the inoculated poloxamers were placed on stainless steel coupons held in Petri dishes containing moistened cotton wool and incubated at 30 degrees C for 5 h. All strains grew well giving between 10(6-7) cfu ml-1 at 5-6 h. The cultured gels were readily applied to tests of biocide effectiveness as the stainless steel coupons could be removed and flooded with biocide solution for fixed exposure times. Provided that the temperature of the biocide solutions was > 15 degrees C, the integrity of the gels could be maintained during exposure. After exposure, the gels and their supports were removed to separate tubes containing neutralizer solution (< 15 degrees C). The gels rapidly dispersed within 5 min to ensure a complete recovery of the sample population. Biofilm-constructs and cell suspensions (10(7) cfu ml-1) were exposed to four commercial disinfectant formulations, based on hypochlorite, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide and a tenside, at recommended use levels. Cell suspensions, in the presence of bovine serum albumen (BSA; 0.03% w/v), were subject to a > 5-log kill within 5 min while the killing effected against the biofilm-constructs varied between 0.4 and 2-log reductions. The results indicate a high degree of reproducibility between replicate samples, with patterns of susceptibility varying both as a function of organism, biocide type and concentration. The experiments strongly support the view that poloxamer-constructs are suitable for application in trials and testing of disinfectant formulations.
TI  - Interaction of the cyclic antimicrobial cationic peptide bactenecin with the outer and cytoplasmic membrane.
AB  - Bactenecin, a 12-amino acid cationic antimicrobial peptide from bovine neutrophils, has two cysteine residues, which form one disulfide bond, making it a cyclic molecule. To study the importance of the disulfide bond, a linear derivative Bac2S was made and the reduced form (linear bactenecin) was also included in this study. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that bactenecin existed as a type I beta-turn structure regardless of its environment, while the reduced form and linear bactenecin adopted different conformations according to the lipophilicity of the environment. Bactenecin was more active against the Gram-negative wild type bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium than its linear derivative and reduced form, while all three peptides were equally active against the outer membrane barrier-defective mutants of the first two bacteria. Only the two linear peptides showed activity against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus facaelis. Bactenecin interacted well with the outer membrane and its higher affinity for E. coli UB1005 lipopolysaccharide and improved ability to permeabilize the outer membrane seemed to account for its better antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. The interaction of bactenecin with the cytoplasmic membrane was determined by its ability to dissipate the membrane potential by using the fluorescence probe 3, 3-dipropylthiacarbocyanine and an outer membrane barrier-defective mutant E. coli DC2. It was shown that the linear derivative and reduced form were able to dissipate the membrane potential at much lower concentrations than bactenecin despite the similar minimal inhibitory concentrations of all three against this barrier-defective mutant.
TI  - Interference in initial adhesion of uropathogenic bacteria and yeasts to silicone rubber by a Lactobacillus acidophilus biosurfactant.
AB  - The ability of the Lactobacillus acidophilus RC14 biosurfactant 'surlactin' to inhibit the initial adhesion of various uropathogenic bacteria and two yeast strains to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber in filter-sterilised pooled human urine. A parallel-plate flow chamber with a silicone rubber bottom plate was filled with a 1.0 mg/ml biosurfactant solution for adsorption overnight (18 h). Subsequently, the adhesion of the bacterial or yeast cells from a urine suspension under low flow (shear rate 15 s(-1)) was followed in situ by automated image analysis. Control tests were with untreated silicone rubber. Initial deposition rates and numbers of adhering cells after 4 h of flow were determined. Surlactin layers caused a marked inhibition of the initial deposition rates and adhesion numbers after 4 h for the majority of the bacteria (11 of 15 strains tested) and this inhibition was particularly effective against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although the initial deposition rates of the two Candida albicans strains were reduced by c. 50% in comparison with the controls, the numbers of yeast cells adhering after 4 h were similar.
TI  - A comparison of skin storage methods for oculoplastic surgery.
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the level of contamination of full-thickness skin grafts stored with or without an antibiotic cover. METHODS: Full-thickness skin grafts were harvested from 40 bilateral upper lid blepharoplasties. Before surgery the face was sterilised, the head of the patient was packed with sterile, single-use surgical drapes and the whole face was left exposed. The harvested full-thickness skin grafts were conserved in sterile containers at 4 degrees C for 6 days, rolled in gauze moistened with either 4 ml of sterile saline solution (group I) or with 4 ml of gentamicin solution (2 mg/ml) (group II). The degree of contamination, expressed in colony forming units (CFU), was evaluated on days 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Identification of the microorganisms was done to species level following standard procedures and commercial methods. RESULTS: In group I 2 grafts (5%) were negative during the whole observation period while the other 38 grafts (95%) presented a degree of contamination ranging from 10(2) to 10(4) CFU. Microorganisms isolated were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (24 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (5 cases), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (2 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 cases), Serratia liquefaciens (1 case) and Klebsiella oxytoca (2 cases). In group II, 26 grafts (65%) were negative during the whole observation time while in 14 cases (35%) a few colonies (3 to 6) of Candida albicans were isolated on day 2 and remained constant in number for the whole observation time. CONCLUSIONS: The storage of full-thickness skin graft with an antibiotic cover is more reliable than the storage of full-thickness skin graft without an antibiotic cover.
TI  - Is the limulus amebocyte lysate the sole predictor of septic episodes in major thermal injuries?
AB  - Septic episodes in thermal injuries are usually hallmarked by a series of physiologic parameters that include tachypnea, prolonged paralytic ileus, hyperthermia or hypothermia, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis or unexplained leukopenia, acidosis, and hyperglycemia. Recent studies with polycystic kidney disease have clearly indicated that the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assays were predictive of fungal infections in this patient population. Because both bacteria and fungi produce lipopolysaccharide that can be identified with the LAL assay, we randomly assayed sequential sera of 45 patients with major thermal injuries for positivity in the LAL assay, with use of the QCL-1000 kit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md). The average burn size of this patient population was 63.43% total body surface area. The average age of the patient was 6.2 years. The sex distribution included 30 males and 15 females. The infectious agents included gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, and 14 patients had concomitant fungal infections. Eighty-five percent of the patients tested were positive for endotoxin, with levels ranging from < 0.1 EU/mL to > 1.0 EU/mL. The predominant organism isolated before or on the date the serum was drawn was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15%). The remaining 34% were a variety of Enterobacteriaceae. Of the 14 patients who yielded a fungus, 3 had negative LAL assays. Two patients with an elevated LAL grew only Staphylococcus epidermidis in the bloodstream and the wounds. These data clearly indicate that the LAL assay cannot be relied on as the sole predictor of septic episodes; however, it can be an adjunctive test to confirm sepsis when the other parameters have been considered.
TI  - Teicoplanin in the prevention of infection in total hip replacement.
AB  - Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to be effective in reducing postoperative wound infections. The rising incidence of infections secondary to methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. S. epidermidis and S. enterococcal prompted us to administer Teicoplanin to infection in elective total joint arthroplasty. In 111 patients Teicoplanin was given in a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg prior to surgery. In the postoperative period no deep infection of the prosthetic device was found in a 14-month follow-up. In two patients the following organisms were isolated from superficial infections of the wound: S. epidermidis (methicillin-sensitive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp. In no patient was revision surgery necessary. The serum concentration of Teicoplanin was within the therapeutic range during surgery, and tissue levels of Teicoplanin in cancellous (6.2 mg/kg, range 3.8-10.9 mg/kg) and cortical (7.1 mg/kg, range 2.6-12.1 mg/kg) bone during surgery in 16 patients exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration of 90% (MIC90) of methicillin-resistant strains reported for methicillin-resistant strains. In our experience a single dose regimen of Teicoplanin is a safe and effective method of antibiotic prophylaxis in hip joint replacement, particularly when methicillin-resistant bacteria are present.
TI  - [Epidemiologic features of hospital pyo-septic infection in a cardiosurgical hospital].
AB  - The results of the epidemiological analysis of morbidity in purulent septic infection in a cardiosurgical hospital during the period of 1990-1963 is presented. As revealed by this analysis, until 1993 the dominating causative agent of this infection was Pseudomonas aeruginosa O16, and since 1994 Staphylococcus epidermidis prevailed. The morbidity dynamics for several years and during individual years is shown. The main risk factors were established. The reanimation department was found to be the main areas where the contamination of patients occurred.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - Effect of therapeutic concentrations of nitric oxide on bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Besides its vasodilative actions, nitric oxide (NO) is also involved  in host defense on a cellular level. We studied the antimicrobial properties of NO in concentrations used with inhaled NO therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension in neonates. DESIGN: In vitro study of bacterial growth of five species, with and without NO exposure. SETTING: Level IV neonatal intensive care unit at a university children's hospital. SUBJECTS: In vitro bacterial cultures. INTERVENTIONS: We tested ten different strains of five bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococcus [GBS/Streptococcus agalactiae], Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), derived from the tracheal isolates of ventilated premature and term infants. Cultures were exposed to three different concentrations of NO (40, 80, and 120 parts per million [ppm]) and bacterial growth was compared with the same strains incubated in ambient air for 24 hrs. After incubation (with or without NO), colony-forming units were counted. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bacterial growth of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was not reduced with the NO concentrations applied. The number of colony-forming units of S. aureus increased at 80 ppm of NO. Growth of S. epidermidis and GBS was significantly affected at 120 ppm, resulting in decreased numbers of colony-forming units as compared with controls exposed to ambient air. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that NO has a selective bacteriostatic effect on some of those bacteria most commonly cultured in tracheal specimens of premature infants and neonates. This effect appears to be dose-dependent and occurs in the upper range of dosages used with inhaled NO therapy. However, in the range of dosages applied in ongoing controlled trials of inhaled NO in neonates and premature infants (1 to 80 ppm), a bacteriostatic effect of NO is not to be expected.
TI  - Reassessment of the incubation time in a controlled clinical comparison of the BacT/Alert aerobic FAN bottle and standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically for the detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - This study assessed the minimum incubation time required to detect bloodstream infections during a controlled clinical comparison of the performance characteristics of the BacT/Alert aerobic FAN bottle and the standard anaerobic bottle used aerobically except on a selective basis. Blood was collected from adults with suspected bloodstream infections and inoculated into each bottle, which was monitored in the BacT/Alert Microbial Detection System. The anaerobic bottle was vented before incubation except when cultures were obtained from patients on the colorectal and gynecologic surgical and emergency services. Statistical analysis was limited to those culture sets in which each bottle was inoculated with > or = 8 mL of blood and bacterial growth was considered to be clinically significant. A total of 682 positive cultures from 243 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. Significantly more isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.001), S. epidermidis (p < 0.001), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (p < 0.001), Enterococcus spp. (p = 0.04), Escherichia coli (p = 0.03), all Enterobacteriaceae (p < 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p = 0.001), and Candida spp. (p < 0.001) were detected by the aerobic FAN bottle. Significantly more septic episodes due to S. aureus, S. epidermidis, other coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Candida spp. were detected by the aerobic FAN bottle. Significantly more bacterial isolates were detected by the aerobic FAN whether or not antibiotics were being administered at the time of blood culture, whereas there were significantly fewer positive cultures in the vented standard anaerobic bottle when patients were receiving antimicrobial therapy than when they were not. All but 5% of positive cultures were detected within three days. Only six of the cultures requiring four or five days of incubation represented true misses, and only one of these six resulted in a change in therapy which, however, did not affect the patent's outcome.
TI  - Study of common aerobic flora of human cerumen.
AB  - Cerumen is the product of the secretion of the sebaceous, ceruminous or apocrine  glands together with cells exfoliated from the cornified stratum of the epithelium of the external auditory canal (EAC). In the present study we identified and quantified common flora of human cerumen. The mean count obtained was 10(6) microorganisms per ml of cerumen suspension. In 24 pools of cerumen (33.3 per cent) the isolates were monomicrobial, Staphylococcus epidermidis (12), Corynebacterium spp (10), Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Streptococcus saprophyticum (1). In 48 pools (66.6 per cent) we found polymicrobial isolates. The most commonly isolated bacteria in these polymicrobial isolates were S. epidermidis (35) and Corynebacterium spp. (43). It is noteworthy that there were isolates of Candida albicans in three cases; in one case of Pseudomonas stutzeri, in one case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, on seven occasions, of S. aureus. The organisms isolated as common bacterial components of human cerumen in our experience were similar to those found by other authors. However, the mean count was much higher. This could be related to climatic conditions and to the length of time the cerumen had remained in the external auditory canal.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - Changes in the strength of attachment of micro-organisms to surfaces following treatment with disinfectants and cleansing agents.
AB  - Suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and biofilms established (16 h) on submerged glass and stainless steel (216 2B) coupons, were exposed to sodium hypochlorite (0.02% or 0.015% w/v), Dodigen (0.0015% w/v or 0.0006% w/v), sodium dodecylsulphate (6% w/v or 0.1% w/v) and Tween-80 (6% w/v) for 5 min at 20 degrees C. Survival was assessed by viable counts and blot succession. Biofilm bacteria were significantly less susceptible to these biocides than were planktonic cells, but their attachment to the surfaces was loosened by such treatments. Treatment with the non-ionic surfactant, Tween-80, however, strengthened the attachment of Staph. epidermidis to stainless steel. Such effects on attachment strength, which are species and surface dependent, have profound implications on post-treatment cleansing and possible re-contamination of product in clean-in-place (CIP) systems.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial adherence to a high-water-content polymer by a water-soluble, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug.
AB  - Deposition and aggregation of lachrymal proteins on the contact lens surface can  promote bacterial adherence. Lysozyme is the major tear protein and is also mainly responsible for the formation of protein deposits on contact lenses. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevent protein aggregation. The effect of a water-soluble NSAID drug on bacterial adherence to high-water-content/ionic disposable contact lenses was examined in a radiolabeling study. Dose-related inhibition of adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on both pretreated lenses and after adding the drug to the medium was investigated. When the drug was added to the media, maximal inhibition of S. aureus adherence was observed in trypticase soy broth (59-98% at the lower and higher drug concentrations, respectively); inhibition progressively decreased in calf aqueous humor (48-75%), lysozyme (34-63%), and saline (12-20%) solutions. Inhibition of adherence varied with the three bacterial species; it was maximal with S. aureus, intermediate with S. epidermidis, and minimal with P. aeruginosa. When lenses were pretreated with the drug, consistent, and even higher, inhibitory effects were observed. The results suggest that water-soluble NSAIDs could be used in preventive treatments for conjunctivae and corneal infections in contact lens wearers, and may provide a clue as to which compounds might inhibit protein interaction and bacterial adhesion.
TI  - Total nutrient admixtures appear safer than lipid emulsion alone as regards microbial contamination: growth properties of microbial pathogens at room temperature.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extraordinary growth properties of most microorganisms in 10% and 20% lipid emulsions has led to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that if lipids are given through an i.v. line, the administration set should be replaced every 24 hours rather than the usual 72-hour interval used for crystalloid solutions, including those used for conventional total parenteral nutrition. For nearly 15 years, parenteral alimentation has been given as a total nutrient admixture (TNA), with the glucose, amino acids, and lipid mixed within the same bag and infused continuously over 24 hours. METHODS: We prospectively studied in a representative TNA (17.6% glucose, 5% amino acids, 4% lipid; pH 5.6, osmolality 1778) and in a control solution, 5% dextrose-in-water (D5%/W), the growth properties at 4, 25, and 35 degrees C of three isolates each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium spp, and Candida albicans, and two isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, the species that are most likely to contaminate TNA during preparation or administration and that have been implicated in >95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infections traced to contaminated parenteral admixtures reported in the world literature. RESULTS: Growth in TNA at 25 and 35 degrees C occurred with only two species, C. albicans and S. saprophyticus, and only after 24 to 48 hours; D5%/W allowed growth at 25 degrees C of two gram-negative species, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that TNA is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens and is no better than D5%/W. The need to replace administration sets every 24 hours with TNA should be reconsidered and ideally be studied in a prospective randomized trial.
TI  - Activities of LL-37, a cathelin-associated antimicrobial peptide of human neutrophils.
AB  - Human neutrophils contain two structurally distinct types of antimicrobial peptides, beta-sheet defensins (HNP-1 to HNP-4) and the alpha-helical peptide LL-37. We used radial diffusion assays and an improved National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-type broth microdilution assay to compare the antimicrobial properties of LL-37, HNP-1, and protegrin (PG-1). Although generally less potent than PG-1, LL-37 showed considerable activity (MIC, <10 microgram/ml) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, even in media that contained 100 mM NaCl. Certain organisms (methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were resistant to LL-37 in media that contained 100 mM NaCl but were susceptible in low-salt media. Burkholderia cepacia was resistant to LL-37, PG-1, and HNP-1 in low- or high-salt media. LL-37 caused outer and inner membrane permeabilization of E. coli ML-35p. Chromogenic Limulus assays revealed that LL-37 bound to E. coli O111:B4 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a high affinity and that this binding showed positive cooperativity (Hill coefficient = 2.02). Circular dichroism spectrometry disclosed that LL-37 underwent conformational change in the presence of lipid A, transitioning from a random coil to an alpha-helical structure. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties of LL-37, its presence in neutrophils, and its inducibility in keratinocytes all suggest that this peptide and its precursor (hCAP-18) may protect skin and other tissues from bacterial intrusions and LPS-induced toxicity. The potent activity of LL-37 against P. aeruginosa, including mucoid and antibiotic-resistant strains, suggests that it or related molecules might have utility as topical bronchopulmonary microbicides in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Influence of preformed alpha-helix and alpha-helix induction on the activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - One prominent class of cationic antibacterial peptides comprises the alpha-helical class, which is unstructured in free solution but folds into an amphipathic alpha-helix upon insertion into the membranes of target cells. To investigate the importance of alpha-helicity and its induction on interaction with membranes, a series of peptides was constructed based on a hybrid of moth cecropin (amino acids 1-8) and bee melittin (amino acids 1-18) peptides. The new peptides were predicted to have a high tendency to form alpha-helices or to have preformed alpha-helices by virtue of construction of a lactam bridge between glutamate and lysine side-chains at positions i and i + 4 at various locations along the primary sequence. In two examples where the use of lactam bridge constraints induced and stabilized alpha-helical structure in benign (aqueous buffer) and/or hydrophobic medium, there was a decrease in antibacterial activity relative to the linear counterparts. Thus the preformation of alpha-helix in solution was not necessarily beneficial to antimicrobial activity. In the one case where the lactam bridge did result in increased antibacterial activity (lower minimal inhibitory concentration values) it did not increase alpha-helical content in benign or hydrophobic medium. Broadly speaking, good activity of the peptides against Pseudomonas aeruginosa correlated best (r2 = 0.88) with a helican parameter which was calculated as the induction of alpha-helix in a membrane-mimicking environment divided by the alpha-helix formation under benign conditions. Interestingly, the activity of the lactam bridge peptide constructs correlated in part with alterations in bacterial outer or cytoplasmic membrane permeability.
TI  - Phagocytic activity of bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophils in intensive care unit  patients on mechanical ventilation.
AB  - In ventilator-dependent patients the management of clinically suspected nosocomial pneumonia is often difficult. A diagnosis of pneumonia is based upon findings including pulmonary infiltrate, fever, leukocytosis, or purulent secretions. By using bronchoscopic techniques, we can obtain bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BAL) from the affected area of the lung. Neutrophils (PMN), which are important for lung defense, are found in increased numbers in BAL of these patients. We therefore ascertained the phagocytic activity of PMN against bacteria and fungi by microscopic examination. BAL specimens from ten mechanically ventilated patients were evaluated to assess the cellular counts using a Burker hemocytometer, the differential cell counts by cytospin preparations (MGG stain), and the phagocytic activity of PMN and macrophages using the intracellular bacteria index (ICB) values. Microscopical examination of BAL cells and evaluation of ICB values (cut-off > 5%) were higher in four out of twelve patients and the quantitative assessment of bacteria in PMN cytoplasm on cytospin preparations was found to be useful for the diagnosis of pneumonia. In these patients, pneumonia was suspected (in one patient fungal pneumonia) on the basis of microscopical examination of BAL cells and ICB values and the findings were confirmed later by microbiological cultures. In conclusion, in patients on mechanical ventilation a rapid diagnosis of bacterial or fungal pneumonia can be made using BAL cytology and by ICB values, and this in turn allows appropriate therapy to be initiated at an early stage. However, further studies of neutrophil functions are required to improve our understanding of the increased incidence of pulmonary infections in these patients.
TI  - Antileukoprotease in human skin: an antibiotic peptide constitutively produced by keratinocytes.
AB  - Antileukoprotease (ALP), also known as mucous protease inhibitor or secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, resembles one of the major antiproteases present in human body fluids. It is capable of preventing proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix proteins by neutrophil-derived serine proteases. ALP was isolated from human callus and detected in supernatants of cultured human primary keratinocytes. ALP mRNA was constitutively expressed in keratinocytes and the expression was not significantly affected by TNF alpha or Interferon gamma stimulation. In microbicidal assays recombinant ALP exhibited antimicrobial activity against several human skin associated microorganisms like P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and C. albicans, indicating that ALP may actively participate in mechanisms allowing homeostasis of bacterial and yeast colonization on human skin. Thus, ALP represents a major soluble serine protease inhibitor and antimicrobial agent expressed in human skin and seems to contribute to the high resistance of the epidermis against proteolysis and infections.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - Percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage for pyogenic spondylitis.
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective evaluation of results in 23 cases of early-stage pyogenic spondylitis treated with percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of percutaneous suction aspiration and drainage as a treatment method for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traditional surgical treatment for pyogenic spondylitis has the disadvantage of increased morbidity caused by the extensive exposure required in the presence of infection. Recently, a few case reports have described minimally invasive treatment for pyogenic spondylitis in which percutaneous suction aspiration was used. However, the efficacy of this new treatment has not yet been evaluated. METHODS: All charts, radiographs, and bacteriologic and histologic findings were reviewed. All 23 patients who received the new treatment were observed clinically and radiographically, to evaluate the efficacy of the treatment. RESULTS: To date, all patients have been observed for more than 2 years. Twenty (87%) of the 23 patients have shown good results according to the evaluation. The causative organism was identified using tissue culturing in 12 (52%) of the 23 patients. The causative organism was Staphylococcus aureus in 8, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium acnes in 1 each. Back pain as the major symptom in these patients was relieved within an average of 9.4 days after the operation. However, the patient in whom the spondylitis was caused by Candida albicans has received this new treatment twice without success. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of percutaneous suction aspiration with drainage shows that it is an effective treatment for early-stage pyogenic spondylitis.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of fluoroquinolones in experimental models of endocarditis.
AB  - We calculated the magnitude of various serum pharmacodynamic parameters for fluoroquinolones in models of experimental endocarditis (EE) described in the literature. Nineteen publications contained data that allowed calculation of these parameters. Data were available for eight fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans streptococci, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in rabbit or rat models. Enterococci were excluded because of poor bactericidal activity. A 24-hour area under the concentration curve (AUC)/minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ratio > or = 100, a peak level/MIC ratio > 8, and continuous levels above the time were associated with a significantly lower number of cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy. The 24-hour AUC/MIC exhibited the best linear correlation with cfu per vegetation after 3-6 days of therapy (r2 = 45%). The pharmacodynamic parameters predictive of efficacy for fluoroquinolones in the treatment of experimental endocarditis are similar to those for other infectious models.
TI  - Reconstituted recombinant factor VIII can be safely infused continuously for at least three days: it is a poor microbial growth medium.
AB  - Reconstituted recombinant factor VIII (FVIIIrec) loses little biologic activity at room temperature for up to seven days and continuous infusion is convenient, effective hemostatically and requires less FVIIIrec concentrate than treatment by conventional bolus injections. However, the potential for bacterial contamination, with proliferation to high levels that can cause bacteremia, is a concern with continuous infusion. We studied the growth properties at 4, 25 and 35 degrees C in reconstituted FVIIIrec (Kogenate) and at 25 degrees C in 5% dextrose in water (D5%W) of three isolates each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Flavobacterium spp. and Candida albicans, species most likely to contaminate infusate during preparation or administration and which have been implicated in more than 95% of all outbreaks and sporadic cases of nosocomial bloodstream infection traced to contaminated admixtures, biologic agents or medications administered parenterally. Reconstituted FVIIIrec allowed growth of only three species at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C: S. marcescens, S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa; logarithmic growth appeared only after 24-48 h. D5%W allowed growth of two gram-negative species, S. marcescens and B. cepacia. We conclude that reconstituted FVIIIrec (Kogenate) is a poor growth medium for most nosocomial pathogens, comparable with D5%W. If reconstituted aseptically, continuous infusion of reconstituted FVIIIrec should be safe, and it should not be necessary to replace the container or tubing more frequently than every 3 days, an administration schedule that can provide effective hemostasis at lower cost.
TI  - Empiric therapy of bacterial infections in patients with severe neutropenia.
AB  - The urgent need to treat presumptive infections in neutropenic patients has meant that initial therapy is empiric based on the pathogens most likely to be responsible for the patient's rise in temperature or other symptoms of infection. The spectrum of causative pathogens has changed over time and reflects the availability and use of antimicrobial agents. Gram-positive organisms predominated in the 1940s and onward until the widespread use of early penicillins and cephalosporins effectively addressed this problem. The upsurge in infections in the 1970s and 1980s caused by Gram-negative organisms, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., has been supplanted by a new wave of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms, this time predominantly Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the viridans streptococci. The fourth-generation cephalosporins (cefpirome) among other broad-spectrum beta-lactams, by virtue of their enhanced antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens and greater beta-lactamase stability, are promising candidates for use in the empiric management of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. Early clinical trial results are promising and should lead the way for further use of these compounds in this indication.
TI  - Mucin gene (MUC 2 and MUC 5AC) upregulation by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial infection of the lung is associated with mucin overproduction. In partial explanation of this phenomenon, we recently reported that supernatant from the Gram-negative organism Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa contained an activity that upregulated transcription of the MUC 2 mucin gene [J.-D. Li, A. Dohrman, M. Gallup, S. Miyata, J. Gum, Y. Kim, J. Nadel, A. Prince, C. Basbaum, Transcriptional activation of mucin by P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 94 (1997) 967-972]. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether mucin genes other than MUC 2 are so regulated and whether Gram-positive organisms also contain mucin stimulatory activity. Results from in situ hybridization and RNase protection assays showed that P. aeruginosa upregulates MUC 5AC as well as MUC 2 in both bronchial explants and cultured airway epithelial cells. The upregulation of both genes by P. aeruginosa can be mimicked by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and can be blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein. In addition, both genes are upregulated by a variety of Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative organisms showing the same rank order of potency. These data indicate the existence of a general mechanism by which epithelial cells respond to the presence of bacteria by increasing mucin synthesis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices.
AB  - Antimicrobial coating of medical devices, including fracture fixation devices, has evolved as a potentially effective method for preventing device-related infections. We examined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of titanium cylinders coated with the antiseptic combination of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol. The coated devices provided zones of inhibition against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, at baseline and up to 8 weeks after incubation of the coated cylinders in human serum at 37 degrees C. This durable antimicrobial activity was attributed to the relatively slow leaching of chlorhexidine and chloroxylenol from the coated cylinders as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. These results suggest that antiseptic-coated orthopaedic devices may provide broad-spectrum and durable antimicrobial protection against device-related infection.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - Resistance to biofilm formation on otologic implant materials.
AB  - New materials and coatings are now being developed to resist permanent bacterial  contamination of implanted medical devices. This study exposed several styles of middle ear ventilation tube materials and coatings to high concentrations of Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus. Electron microscopy was then used to evaluate these tubes' resistance to bacterial biofilm formations. Ionized, processed silicone tubes were the only tubes resistant to Pseudomonas adhesion. Tubes that were made of fluoroplastic or that were ionized processed were very resistant to Staphylococcus contamination when compared with untreated silicone or silver oxide-treated silicone. This study suggests that ionized, coated fluoroplastic would be a highly effective tube material in preventing bacterial biofilm contamination of implanted ventilation tubes.
TI  - [Incidence of postoperative wound infections in The Netherlands].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To inventory postoperative infections in Dutch hospitals. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: National organization for quality assurance in hospitals, Utrecht, the Netherlands. METHOD: In 36 Dutch hospitals data on surgical patients, surgical site infections and risk factors were collected, using standardised methods, as part of a quality system by which hospitals could compare their infection rates with the rates in the database. RESULTS: Surveillance of surgical site infections was introduced in 36/118 (31%) hospitals. Data on 32,869 surgical procedures were collected, 1115 (3.4%) surgical site infections were found. The infection rates by wound contamination class varied from 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-2.4) in clean wounds to 11% (95% CI: 9.3-12.8) in dirty wounds; the infection rates by duration of operation varied from 3% (95% CI: 2.8-3.2) in operations lasting less than two hours to 10.8% (95% CI: 6.0-18.5) in operations lasting more than 8 hours; the infection rate by ASA classification varied from 2.7% (95% CI: 2.3-3.2) in class I to 15.5% (95% CI: 8.4-26.5) in patients in class IV. Advanced age, emergency, preoperative stay were recognised as risk factors. The infection rates in the most frequently recorded types of operation varied from 0.2% (95% CI: 0.0-1.1) in varicose veins to 9.8% (95% CI: 7.2-13.2) in femoral bypass grafts. The use of antimicrobial prophylaxis varied per type of operation. The micro-organisms most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Of the infections 32% were identified in the first week following surgery. Of the infected patients 88% stayed in hospital during one or more days following the onset of infection.
TI  - Regulation of chemokine gene expression in human peripheral blood neutrophils phagocytosing microbial pathogens.
AB  - Production of chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) by neutrophils is likely to be important in the regulation of inflammation and the control of infection. In this study we show that exposure of human neutrophils to various microbial pathogens leads to the production of both macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha) and IL-8. The bacterial microbes, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus all strongly induced both IL-8 and MIP-1alpha secretion, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans were less potent. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and zymosan both induced IL-8 secretion but failed to stimulate that of MIP-1alpha. Coincubation of neutrophils with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the micro-organisms also led to differential expression of MIP-1alpha and IL-8. Significant enhancement of the induction of both MIP-1alpha and IL-8 by S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and S. pneumoniae as well as by C. albicans was observed. In contrast, while IL-8 production in response to S. cerevisiae and zymosan was enhanced in the presence of TNF-alpha, no MIP-1alpha was produced. These combined results indicate that while neutrophils exposed to some micro-organisms alone or in the presence of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha will produce both MIP-1alpha and IL-8, resulting in generation of signals for the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes and neutrophils, respectively, certain types of microorganisms can skew this response toward synthesis of IL-8.
TI  - In vitro efficacy of a hydrophilic central venous catheter loaded with silver to  prevent microbial colonization.
AB  - A method was developed to load the surface of a central venous catheter with silver to prevent bacterial colonization. Silver confers a broad antimicrobial activity with a relatively low risk of resistance. Catheters were incubated with a silver nitrate solution in different concentrations. The solvent, incubation temperature and incubation period were varied to examine the influence on the catheter loading. With increasing incubation temperature, time and concentration of silver nitrate, higher rates of silver elution were observed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Furthermore, by using ethanol-water as a solvent instead of pure water, the amount of silver bound to the catheter surface was enhanced. The release of silver from the catheter surface is mainly controlled by first order kinetics. Antimicrobial efficacy of the modified catheter, in comparison to unloaded catheters, was tested in a stationary and a dynamic model with different microorganisms. Adherence experiments with Candida albicans showed almost complete inhibition of growth during a period of 72 hours, including initial adherence. While initial adherence of bacteria could not be prevented, these experiments showed an excellent reduction of bacterial colonization. In a perfusion model, adhesion of E. coli could be reduced for at least seven days. Further studies are planned to examine prolonged antimicrobial effects.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Defects in type III secretion correlate with internalization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by epithelial cells.
AB  - Previous characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates has demonstrated an inverse correlation between cytotoxicity and internalization by epithelial cells. To further investigate this relationship, we tested PA103, a cytotoxic P. aeruginosa strain, and 33 isogenic noncytotoxic transposon mutants for internalization by Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The majority of the mutants were not internalized, demonstrating that an inverse correlation between cytotoxicity and bacterial uptake by epithelial cells is not absolute. Six of the noncytotoxic mutants, however, demonstrated measurable levels of internalization by standard aminoglycoside exclusion assays even though internalization of wild-type strain PA103 was not detectable. All six had evidence of protein secretion defects involving two proteins, a 40-kDa protein and a 32-kDa protein. These proteins, designated PepB (for Pseudomonas exoprotein B) and PepD, respectively, each had characteristics of type III transported proteins. In addition, nucleotide sequencing studies demonstrated that PepB and PepD are homologs of YopB and YopD, respectively, type III secreted proteins of Yersinia spp. necessary for the translocation of effector molecules into the cytoplasmic compartment of eukaryotic cells. Thus, while many mutations in PA103 result in loss of cytotoxicity without an appreciable increase in internalization, defects in transport of type III secretion proteins PepB and PepD correlate with both loss of cytotoxicity and gain of internalization. These results are consistent with type III secretion of an inhibitor of internalization that requires PepB and PepD for translocation into the host cell.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from neutropenic patients and their resistance to antibiotics].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Gram negative as well as Gram positive bacteria participate  in febrile episodes of neutropenic patients, in particular recently the ratio of Gram positive bacteria is increasing. The objective of the present work was to investigate the incidence and antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacterial agents in neutropenic patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of bacteria was investigated in 446 neutropenic patients hospitalized at the Haematological Clinic in 1995. Haemocultures (apparatus Bact/Alert 120, cultivation media Organon-Teknika) and urine were examined. The sensitivity for antibiotics was tested by the standard dilution micromethod. In blood most frequently Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated (45.4%), coagulase-negative strains of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (14.4%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii (complex 6.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.3%). In urine the following were detected: Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.5%), Enterococcus sp. (14.5%), Escherichia coli (13.1%), Enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and Enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). In all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficiency of hydrogel contact lens soaking solutions marketed in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial efficiency of 20 commercially available solutions for soaking and rinsing soft contact lenses was studied in relation to 5 bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Serratia marcescens) and 1 fungus (Candida albicans). Each product was separately inoculated with each of six microorganisms, and samples of the inoculated contact lens solutions were taken at predetermined times, placed in a recovery medium, and incubated. Where there was growth, the colonies were counted. There were differences in performance even between solutions labeled as having the same antimicrobial content. One of the solutions marketed in Spain to soak hydrogel contact lenses failed to inactivate all six test strains.
TI  - Modulation of bacterial adhesion to hydrogel contact lenses by albumin.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to measure the abilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains to adhere to two hydrogel lens materials and measure the effect of a protein-coated surface on the number of adhered bacteria. METHODS: Proteins absorbed to contact lenses during sleep were extracted, subjected to sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and probed for the presence of albumin. Bacterial adhesion was measured by counting bacteria adherent to contact lenses coated in vitro in increasing concentrations of albumin, examining the ability of albumin in solution to prevent adhesion to albumin-coated lenses, and examining the topography of bacterial adhesion by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Albumin adsorbed to lenses during overnight wear. In vitro studies demonstrated that Polymacon lenses adsorbed more albumin than Etafilcon A lenses. In general, the numbers of adherent bacteria increased with increasing concentration of albumin. Bacteria adhered in higher numbers to Polymacon lenses than Etafilcon A (p < 0.05). P. aeruginosa showed an increased adhesion as the amount of albumin on Etafilcon A lenses increased. There was a decrease in numbers of bacteria adhering per milligram of albumin as the level of albumin increased on Polymacon lenses. Cells tended to adhere to "deposits" on albumin-coated lenses. DISCUSSION: Albumin adsorbed onto the surface of contact lenses modulated the ability of P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis to adhere. P. aeruginosa is commonly associated with contact lens-associated microbial keratitis, where bacterial adhesion to contact lenses is believed to be an important first step in the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - Novel fluoroquinolone antibacterial agents containing oxime-substituted (aminomethyl)pyrrolidines: synthesis and antibacterial activity of 7-(4-(aminomethyl)-3-(methoxyimino)pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6- fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro[1,8]naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (LB20304).
AB  - New pyrrolidine derivatives, which bear an alkyloxime substituent in the 4-position and an aminomethyl substituent in the 3-position of the pyrrolidine ring, have been synthesized and coupled with various quinolinecarboxylic acids to produce a series of new fluoroquinolone antibacterials. These fluoroquinolones were found to possess potent antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Variations at the C-8 position of the quinolone nucleus included fluorine, chlorine, nitrogen, methoxy, and hydrogen atom substitution. The activity imparted to the substituted quinolone nucleus by the C-8 substituent was in the order F (C5-NH2) > F (C5-H) > naphthyridine > Cl = OMe = H against Gram-positive organisms. In the case of Gram-negative strains, activity was in the order F (C5-NH2) > naphthyridine = F (C5-H) > H > Cl > OMe. The advantages provided by the newly introduced oxime group of the quinolones were clearly demonstrated by their comparison to a desoximino compound 30. In addition, the oxime moiety greatly improved the pharmacokinetic parameters of the novel quinolones. Among these compounds, compound 20 (LB20304) showed the best in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile in animals, as well as good physical properties. The MICs (microgram/mL) of LB20304, compound 30, and ciprofloxacin against several test organisms are as follows: S. aureus 6538p (0.008, 0.031, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. aureus 241 (4, 16, and 128), Streptococcus epidermidis 887E (0.008, 0.016, and 0.13), methicillin resistant S. epidermidis 178 (4, 32, and 128), Enterococcus faecalis 29212 (0.063, 0.13, and 1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E (0.25, 0.5, and 0.13), Escherichia coli 3190Y (0.008, 0.016, and 0.008), Enterobacter cloacae P99 (0.008, 0.031, and 0.008), Actinobacter calcoaceticus 15473 (0.063, 0.13, and 0.25). On the basis of these promising results, LB20304 was selected as a candidate for further evaluation.
TI  - Enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Model biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas  fluorescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. Plaque-resembling biofilms of Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. The activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. Glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. A complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have a significant bactericidal activity. Combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.
TI  - A review of the in vitro activity of meropenem and comparative antimicrobial agents tested against 30,254 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated world wide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of meropenem (formerly SM-7738), a new carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem and five other broad-spectrum antimicrobials (ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin) against 30,254 clinically significant pathogens isolated in nine countries worldwide. Overall, the carbapenems, meropenem and imipenem, were the most active drugs. Meropenem was four- to 64-fold more active than imipenem against Gram-negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. Meropenem was also quite active against ceftazidime-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting 87.5 to 100% at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. In contrast, imipenem was four- to eight-fold more active than meropenem against Gram-positive species, including methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. Among the anaerobes, strains resistant to meropenem or imipenem were encountered very rarely. These extensive data provide additional in vitro support for the clinical use of meropenem as a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent active against key pathogenic species of bacteria.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (H) versus unhealthy (UH) animals with respiratory signs. The prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper and lower respiratory tract of H and UH Najdi sheep, Somali sheep and Holstein calves. The characteristics of Pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of Pasteurella haemolytica were identified in H and UH animals, Eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of UH Najdi and Somali sheep and Holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of UH sheep were Moraxella spp., Pseudomonas pseudomallei, Erysipelothrix spp., Pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in UH calves were Pasteurella haemolytica, Actinomyces spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of UH animals, namely Actinomyces pyogenes, Erysipelothrix spp., P. haemolytica, Pasteurella ureae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of the animals surveyed. Of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified P. haemolytica and P. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from UH as compared to those from H animals. These were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of P. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of P. multocida recovered from healthy animals. The only biotype of P. haemolytica isolated from H animals was biotype A, while both biotypes A (88.0% of the isolates) and T (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from UH animals.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancies. Analysis of risk factors, etiological agents and prognostic indicators.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with hematological malignancies are at increased risk for developing bacteremia. No previous study has investigated the risk and prognostic indicators of bacteremia in such patients using a statistical approach. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in 106 patients with hematological malignancies (group A). Two hundred and twelve patients were included as controls and divided into two groups: 106 patients with hematological malignancy without bacteremia (group B) and 106 HIV-infected patients with bacteremia (group C). RESULTS: At univariate analysis, bacteremia risk factors in group A were: neutropenia for more than six days (p = 0.03 vs. group B), central venous catheter usage (p = 0.04) and absence of antibiotic prophylaxis (p = 0.03). At multivariate analysis, the use of CVC and neutropenia were independent bacteremia risk factors. The most frequent etiological agents were: Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparing groups A and C, the distribution of Staphylococcus spp. was different, with S. epidermidis being prevalent in hematological patients only. As regards gram-negative organisms, it is of note that no episode of NT-Salmonella bacteremia was observed in group A, unlike group C, where they represent the second leading etiological agents. In group A, 14% of the patients died. Persistent neutropenia (p = 0.01) and the presence of relapsed neoplasm (p = 0.04) were prognostic indicators of bacteremia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that bacteremia in patients with hematological malignancies strictly correlates with the intensity and length of neutropenia and CVC usage. Although we observed a low mortality rate, we stress that this clinical condition requires special attention from the physician, who must recognize and treat it promptly.
TI  - Much ado about nothing: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The pathogenic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has received a  voluminous amount of notoriety. The four major reasons are its morbidity, mortality rate, cost of treatment, and constant appearance in intensive care units. Both Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis (MRSE) account for 82% of our gram-positive wound isolates, whereas the gram-negative account for 34% of all isolates. Therefore we compared the morbidity, mortality rate, and cost factors related to MRSA-MRSE and gram-negative infections for a 4-year period, assessing more than 214 documented infections. Morbidity and mortality rates were minor for MRSA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli accounted for 57.5% of the total gram-negative isolates. Gram-negative antimicrobial therapy usually requires two therapeutic drugs, which increases morbidity and costs, whereas the staphylococci usually can be treated by one antimicrobial. During this period there were 47 gram-negative infections requiring 10 to 15 additional days of hospital stay, with a daily antibiotic cost of $293.40. Costs for MRSA or MRSE are 28% less. Therefore our preoccupation with MRSA or MRSE infections is unwarranted and unsubstantiated.
TI  - Infections complicating pulsed carbon dioxide laser resurfacing for photoaged facial skin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With proper technique and instrumentation, laser resurfacing for facial wrinkles has been found to be highly effective and relatively safe. Most, if not all, of the noninfectious complications such as pigmentary changes, scarring, and persistent erythema can either be avoided or managed with appropriate therapy. Postoperative infections, on the other hand, may develop despite proper technique and instrumentation. Without proper management, they may cause significant physical morbidity and psychological distress defying the expected benefit of the procedure. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the incidence and to study the characteristics of infections arising after laser resurfacing for facial wrinkles with pulsed carbon dioxide laser treatment. METHOD: A retrospective study was carried out by reviewing the records of all patients undergoing laser resurfacing for facial wrinkles from January 1, 1995 to April 30, 1996. An infection is defined as a positive culture in the presence of signs or symptoms of an infection. RESULTS: Over 16 months, 395 procedures were performed and 17 cases of culture-proven infection recorded, an incidence of 4.3%. All patients had symptoms starting between days 2 and 10 after the operation. Over half of the patients had multiple infections with two to three microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common causative agent, found in 41% of all infected cases, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (35%), S. epidermidis (35%), and Candida species (24%). Multiple drug-resistant, gram-negative bacteria were found in four cases, implicating the possibility of hospital-acquired infections. Almost all isolates of gram-positive bacteria were resistant to both erythromycin and penicillin, but not oxacillin. With proper treatment, most patients healed normally. Only one patient had persistent, multiple atrophic scars due to locally disseminated herpes simplex infection despite proper prophylaxis and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative infection is uncommon and manageable with early recognition and proper treatment. The types of infectious agents being found are very similar to those reported in burn patients. This complication has been found to be much more common in patients undergoing full face resurfacing and those using a bio-occlusive dressing postoperatively. With comprehensive preventive and management measures, it is likely that this type of uncommon, yet distressful, complication can be avoided and more successfully treated. Recommendations are made for prevention and management of suspected postoperative infections.
TI  - Microbial growth inside saline-filled breast implants.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to determine whether intraluminal saline in breast implants can support the growth of common wound-infecting microorganisms over a prolonged period of time. The bacteria tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Three fungal species also were tested: Aspergillus fumigatus, Paecilomyces variotii, and Candida albicans. In the in vitro study, four organisms survived in flasks of sterile saline for the 2 weeks in which serial cultures were performed: K. pneumoniae, C. albicans, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. In the in vivo study, 61 white rabbits (122 implants) received both an experimental implant inoculated with one of the test organisms and a control implant containing only sterile saline. They were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, or 6-month scheduled endpoints. None of the control implants containing sterile saline had positive cultures. In contrast, the intraluminal saline was culture positive for 7 of the 10 inoculated organisms after varying lengths of time: S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. cloacae, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, A. fumigatus, and P. variotii. Samples of capsular tissue also were cultured. Of the 122 capsular tissue specimens, 21 (17 percent) had positive cultures and surrounded both inoculated and sterile implants. In most instances, capsules that were culture positive contained an organism different from the one that had been inoculated in the group. In only 3 cases was the same organism cultured from both the periprosthetic tissue and the intraluminal saline, and these may represent instances of the inoculated organism migrating through the implants filler valves. The data show that several types of bacteria (particularly gram-negative species) and fungi can grow and reproduce in a restricted saline environment for extended periods of time.
TI  - Evaluation of the cathetron system for recycling angioplasty catheters.
AB  - The Cathetron (Minntech Corporation, Minneapolis, MN) peracetic acid-based reprocessing method for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) catheters was evaluated for ability to sterilize and maintain catheter integrity. The balloons and lumens of 42 catheters (140 reprocessing cycles) were inoculated with suspensions of Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus circulans. Five catheters failed the initial evaluation of mechanical integrity and were discarded. Cultures from 37 catheter lumens, balloons, and hubs (n = 349) were negative following reprocessing. The Cathetron system reliably sterilized PTCA catheter, however, further studies using different brands of catheters and evaluating catheter sterility over time under storage conditions are required.
TI  - Susceptibility of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant hospital bacteria to disinfectants.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria  exhibited altered susceptibility to disinfectants. DESIGN: Antibiotic-susceptible bacteria were obtained from American Type Culture Collection: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hospital strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria were obtained from clinical isolates, including: S aureus, S epidermidis, E coli, Enterococcus species, K pneumoniae, and P aeruginosa. The Association of Official Analytical Chemist's use-dilution method was used to test these 12 strains of 7 bacterial pathogens for their susceptibility to a phenol and a quaternary ammonium compound. For five pathogens, we tested a susceptible and a more resistant strain in 20 comparative trials (5 pathogens, 2 disinfectants, 2 dilutions per disinfectant). RESULTS: In our 20 comparative trials, the antibiotic-resistant strains exhibited an increased resistance to the disinfectant in only a single instance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the development of antibiotic resistance does not appear to be correlated to increased resistance to disinfectants.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - [Changes in patterns and resistances of bacteria from 731 patients with bacteremia in 11 years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the changes in patterns and resistances of bacteria from patients with bacteremia in 11 years. METHODS: Diffusion tests were used to measure the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the patients with bacteremia. RESULTS: The proportion of staphylococcus epidermidis in bacteremia increased significantly. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in bacteremia caused by staphyiococcus increased markedly. Resistance of MRSA and methlcillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) to penicillin, and gentamycin increased significantly. Compared 1986-1990, with 1991-1996, the resistance of S. epidermidis to penicillin, erythromycin and methicillin increased markedly, so did resistance of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbenicillin, and piperacillin, resistance of E. coli to gentamycin and cefoperazone, resistance of klebsiella to ampicillin and carbenicillin. The resistance of enterobacteriaceae which induced beta-lactamase to the first to the third generation of cephalosporins was relatively high. CONCLUSION: The resistance of bacteria to the commonly used antibiotics was produced in various degrees.
TI  - Reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - A total of 256 swabs taken from different areas of neonatal intensive care units  (ICU) in KCG Hospital and AMC Hospital, Bangalore were bacteriologically investigated for prevalence, source and spread of nosocomial bacteria. Culture studies revealed growth in 217 (84.8%) swab samples indicating considerable contamination of different areas of the units and sources of infection. Klebsiella pneumoniae (27.3%) was the predominant organism followed by Esch coli (16.8%), Staph aureus (11.7%), Staph epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.2%), enterococcus and proteus (4.7%), Citrobacter freundi (3.5%) and Clostridium tetani (2.4%) isolated from the equipment, cradles, other inanimate objects and environmental surfaces. Out of 312 isolates, monobacterial prevalence was 43.6% in contrast to polybacterial prevalence of 56.4%. Klebsiella pneumoniae (74.3%) was the predominant monobacterial isolate. The indoor air of the units was found to carry common nosocomial bacteria of 4 or more different bacterial species at dangerous levels as observed by colony counts of 15 to 30 on exposed blood agar plates. Almost all sources in ICU revealed the presence of Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Esch coli, pseudomonas and staphylococcus thus forming the potential reservoirs of nosocomial infections to babies and this could be attributed to overcrowding, poor ventilation system and failure to follow basic principles of strict protective barrier nursing.
TI  - [Mechanism of bacteriopyknosis].
AB  
TI  - A simple artificial urine for the growth of urinary pathogens.
AB  - A simple artificial urine medium (AUM) has been developed which provides conditions similar to that found in human urine. AUM solidified with agar enabled the recovery of a wide range of urease-positive and -negative urinary pathogens. Liquid AUM supported growth at concentrations of up to 10(8) cfu ml-1, as found in normal urine. Reproducible, steady-state growth also occurred over many generations in continuous culture. AUM was capable of forming crystals and encrustations resembling those found in natural urinary tract infections. The medium is a suitable replacement for normal urine for use in a wide range of experiments modelling the growth and attachment of urinary pathogens in the clinical environment.
TI  - Hydrocortisone 17-butyrate degradation in the presence of micro-organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the degradation of hydrocortisone 17-butyrate (H17B) in the presence of six different bacteria, commonly found on psoriatic skin. METHOD: H17B and its degradation products (hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone 21-butyrate (H21B)) were assayed by HPLC. RESULTS: In the absence of micro-organisms, we observed 16.6 +/- 7.1% degradation. In the presence of micro-organisms and otherwise similar conditions, we noted that H17B degradation was not modified by cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae). Three bacilli increased degradation, Escherichia coli 59.1 +/- 19.4%, Klebsiella oxytoca 62.1 +/- 6.7% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 56.0 +/- 17.9%. CONCLUSION: The degradation of H17B into hydrortisone and H21B may produce a loss of therapeutic activity.
TI  - Benzalkonium chloride: a potential disinfecting irrigation solution.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the disinfecting properties of benzalkonium chloride as an irrigation agent. DESIGN: Comparison was made between irrigation of contaminated muscle strips with benzalkonium chloride and normal saline (control). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Benzalkonium chloride is a cationic disinfectant, which has questionable efficacy in an organic environment. However, no previous study has attempted to use high volumes of this cationic solution to overcome the neutralizing effect of organic tissue and thus maintain this detergent's germicidal properties. METHODS: 2.5 cm x 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm pieces of bovine muscle were aseptically cut from the center of freshly harvested beef muscle and incubated with 1.0 x 10(7) colony forming units of bacteria for 15 minutes. The muscle strips were then irrigated with either 100 mL, 1 L, or 10 L of benzalkonium chloride at a 1:2000 concentration in normal saline. Normal saline was used as the control. The muscle strips were sonicated to remove adherent bacteria; the number of living organisms was determined by quantitatively culturing the sonicate. RESULTS: In vitro, benzalkonium chloride was superior to normal saline at disinfecting bovine muscle (p < or = 0.001). When 10 L of benzalkonium chloride irrigation was used, no living bacteria could be recovered (p < or = 0.012). CONCLUSION: In this experimental setting benzalkonium chloride was an effective disinfection agent, with enhanced activity at large volumes.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - Infection around joint replacements in patients who have a renal or liver transplantation.
AB  - The results of thirty-five joint (hip or knee) replacements in nineteen patients  who had an organ transplantation were retrospectively reviewed. The patients received a standard immunosuppressive induction regimen at the time of the transplantation and were maintained on a combination of prednisone, azathioprine, and cyclosporine A. All patients received antibiotics perioperatively, but antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was not used for any procedure. Six joint replacements, in three patients who were an average of 48.2 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, were performed before a renal transplantation. Twenty-four joint replacements, in fourteen patients who were an average of 40.9 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, were performed after an organ transplantation. Two patients, who were an average of 53.8 years old at the time of the arthroplasty, each had a joint replacement both before and after a liver transplantation (a total of five joint replacements). The average duration of follow-up from the first joint replacement was 8.8 years (range, one to twenty-three years). The Harris hip score or The Hospital for Special Surgery knee score was determined at the time of the latest follow-up examination. An infection developed around the implant in five patients who had had the joint replacement after a transplantation. The average interval from implantation of the prosthesis until detection of the infection was 3.4 years (range, one to six years). One patient who had a liver transplant was infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and another one was infected with Escherichia coli. One patient who had a renal transplant was infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis; one, with Enterococcus; and one, with Serratia marcescens. We found that patients who had a joint replacement after an organ transplantation had a very high risk of devastating infection. The rate of such infection was 19 per cent (five of twenty-seven joint replacements in sixteen patients).
TI  - Neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Airway colonization with Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. Whether GNB are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (BSI) and/or to the severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is unknown. METHODS: We prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. Data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. The severity of BPD was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with GPC (Staphylococus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). Superimposed on 36% of these infants was GNB airway colonization with Klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), Enterobacter cloacae (25%), Escherichia coli (25%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), Serratia marcescen (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii and Haemophilus influenzae (5%). Comparison between 174 GPC- and 86 GNB-colonized infants showed that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. Fifteen percent of GNB-colonized infants developed BSI caused by GNB and 14% developed BSI caused by GPC. No significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and BSI was noted. GNB infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with GPC. GNB colonization was a predictor of severe BPD after controlling for ventilation. Ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of GNB-colonized and 33% of noncolonized infants and was not a predictor of BPD severity. CONCLUSION: GNB airway colonization creates a moderate risk for BSI. Antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate GNB. GNB airway colonization is associated with severe BPD, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate GNB from the airways should be undertaken.
TI  - Wound infection after median sternotomy during the war in Croatia.
AB  - From 1990 to 1994 at Clinical Hospital Center, Zagreb, 1904 median sternotomies were performed for cardiac operations. Patients shared the same intensive care unit (ICU) with the wounded persons, admitted to the hospital from battlefield. Infection developed in 124 patients, an incidence of 6.51%. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from 90, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) from 19, and gram negative bacilli (GNB) from 56 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, and Clostridium pneumoniae in 1 case. Ninety-six patients (5.04%) developed superficial localized infection of subcutaneous tissues and they were treated with frequent dressing changes with antibiotic-soaked gauze in combination with systemic antibiotics. Twenty-eight patients (1.47%) developed mediastinitis and sternal dehiscence. They were treated by operative debridement followed by reclosure of the sternum with continuous antibiotic irrigation. We obtained satisfactory results with our method of closure of sternum which is a modification of Robicsek's technique. Nine of them required further operation. In seven cases we performed muscle flaps and in two omentoplasty. One hundred and twenty patients were discharged in satisfactory condition. The uncontrolled mediastinal sepsis caused death in 4 patients. Higher infection rate after median sternotomy during 1991 and 1992 could be possibly explained with the war circumstances in Croatia, and especially with MRSA strain becoming endemic in surgical ICU.

AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of BAY 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  - BAY 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. The MIC90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8 mg/l. Against the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or = 10-fold less active. MIC90s for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. Against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. Against gram-negative bacteria BAY 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. BAY 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. The bactericidal activity against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin G, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. As compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance was less pronounced. The spontaneous mutation frequency towards BAY 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in Escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in S. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Measurement of bacterial growth rates on polymers.
AB  - A video microscope system and a mathematical model were developed to observe and  model the early stage of bacterial growth on polymer surfaces. Glass slides were coated with polyorthoester, poly(L-lactic acid), and polysulfone, and inserted into a laminar flow cell to expose them to bacterial cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. The free energy of adhesion (delta Fadh) was determined from contact-angle measurements. The microscopic observations along with the mathematical model allowed measurement of the rates of adhesion, release, and growth. The growth rate of P. aeruginosa on the various surfaces correlated to the delta Fadh. The growth rates of all species on all of the surfaces were slower than the growth rates of the bacteria in suspension. The mathematical model is valid for early growth before the bacteria form a complete monolayer, and is useful in predicting and modeling early growth of bacteria on implanted biomaterials.

TI  - Effects of plasma on adhesion of biofilm forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis to fibrin substrate.
AB  - Bacterial adhesion has been identified as the critical initial step in the pathogenesis of foreign body related infection. Recent investigations have shown microbial binding to implanted polymeric materials using specific adhesion of bacteria to immobilized plasma proteins, such as fibrin. These proteins are though to function as bridging molecules to facilitate bacterial colonization of the surface. The authors' results indicated a significant reduction in adhesion of biofilm forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase negative Staphylococcus epidermidis to immobilized fibrin strands in the presence of platelet poor plasma (PPP) as compared to studies performed with phosphate buffered saline and Hank's balanced salt solution. A 10-fold decrease in the number of adherent bacteria was noted for samples exposed to PPP as compared to control samples. The effective range of PPP concentrations capable of producing the marked decrease in binding to fibrin strands was determined to be 1-100% for P. aeruginosa and 4-100% for S. epidermidis.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of acidic electrolyzed water--comparison of chemical acidic  sodium hydrochloride (NaOCl) solution].
AB  - Acidic electrolyzed water is made recently by various kinds of machines and is widely utilized. In this study, we intended to clarify the relationship between the concentration of chloride and pH in the bactericidal effects with acidic electrolyzed water. The effects of weak or strong acidic electrolyzed water were compared with a pseudo-acidic water of pH adjusted by diluted hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomononas aeruginosa. At pH 5.0 approximately 6.0, 3 bacterial strains were killed soon after being exposed to the acidic water containing chloride 50 mg/liter, and the amount of chloride did not change after allowing to stand open for 6 hours. At pH 2.67 approximately 2.80, the bactericidal effects was observed at the concentration of chloride 5 mg/liter, and 80% of chloride remained after allowing to stand for 6 hours. These results indicated that newly made strong acidic water is more effective under a smaller amount of chloride at pH 2.7, and that weak acidic electrolyzed water should be used, if stable bactericidal effect is expected in cleaning the surroundings.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water.
AB  - We tested the antimicrobial activity of superoxidized water against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. The number of bacteria was reduced below detection limit following incubation in superoxidized water for 10 s. The bactericidal activity of superoxidized water was similar to that of 80% ethanol, but superior to that of 0.1% chlorhexidine and 0.02% povidone iodine. We conclude that superoxidized water is a low cost but powerful disinfectant.
TI  - Peritonitis associated with exit site and tunnel infections.
AB  - We reviewed all episodes of peritonitis associated with exit site and/or tunnel infection (n = 87; rate, 0.1/yr; 13% of all peritonitis episodes) occurring from 1979 to 1995. The exit site or tunnel infection was diagnosed at the time or shortly after the patient presented with peritonitis in 66% of the episodes. In the other one third the exit site or tunnel infection was diagnosed a median of 40 days prior to the development of peritonitis. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 52% of episodes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the next most common organism. In 63 (72%) of the episodes the catheter was removed to resolve the infection at a median of 8 days (range, 0 to 226 days) from the onset of peritonitis. Catheter removal after 5 days predominately for refractory peritonitis (n = 23; median time to removal, 8 days) or relapsing peritonitis (n = 11; median time to catheter removal, 103 days). Patients with relapsing peritonitis suffered two to four episodes prior to removal of the catheter. Patients with peritonitis associated with tunnel infection were more likely to lose their catheter than patients with peritonitis associated with exit site infection (86% v 58%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis infections were less likely to result in catheter loss compared with all other organisms (15% v 82%). After a protocol to reduce S aureus catheter infections was implemented in 1990, the rate of catheter-related peritonitis decreased from 0.14/yr to 0.05/yr due to a decrease in S aureus episodes. We conclude that peritonitis episodes associated with a tunnel infection infrequently resolve without catheter removal. Delayed catheter removal in such circumstances often results in refractory or relapsing peritonitis. Therefore, catheter removal should be done promptly. Antibiotic prophylaxis for S aureus can reduce catheter-related peritonitis.
TI  - Prevalence of bacteria in the conjunctival sac and on the eyelid margin of clinically normal cats.
AB  - Samples from the palpebral conjunctive, third eyelid and eyelid margin from 50 asymptomatic cats were analysed. Sixty-seven per cent of the samples showed bacterial growth with a high predominance of the genus Staphylococcus (97.8 per cent). The most frequent species was S epidermidis (45.7 per cent), followed by S simulans (23.9 per cent), S auricularis (17.4 per cent) and S saprophyticus (6.5 per cent). Three samples of S aureus (6.5 per cent) and one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.1 per cent) were also identified. The role of these microorganisms in the eyes of cats is discussed and the importance of the new species Staphylococcus felis is stressed.
TI  - Surgical treatment of infected thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms.
AB  - Twelve patients with infected aneurysms of the thoracic and abdominal aorta were  evaluated. Aneurysmal location, aetiology, bacteriology and treatment modality were analysed to determine the relationship between these factors and outcome. Patients were divided into two groups based on the preoperative states of their infections. Group 1 patients (n = 7) underwent resection after resolution of their active infection. The causative organisms included Staphylococcus epidermidis (two cases). Salmonella spp. (one). Acinetobacter (one), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (one) and unknown organisms (two). Group 2 patients (n = 5) required urgent surgery because of uncontrolled sepsis despite intensive treatment with antibiotics. The causative organisms included Staphylococcus aureus (two cases). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two) and Salmonella spp. (one). In group 1, three patients underwent closed en bloc excision of the aneurysm with in-situ graft replacement, and four underwent partial resection with in-situ graft replacement. In group 2, three patients underwent resection of the aneurysm with ligation of aorta and extra-anatomic bypass, and two underwent in-situ graft replacement after debridement of infected tissue. Overall, patients in group 1 had a mortality rate of 14% compared with 80% in group 2. These results suggest that the operative approach and method chosen to restore arterial continuity have less of an impact on outcome. The primary determinants of outcome are virulence of the infecting organism and the preoperative state of the infection.
TI  - Disinfecting agents for removing adherent bacteria from orthopaedic hardware.
AB  - This investigation seeks to determine whether surfactants or detergents can be used to clean and disinfect orthopaedic wounds with implanted hardware. Thus, a stepwise investigation of biocompatible surfactants and detergents was performed to identify an irrigation agent for disinfecting orthopaedic wounds. Bacterial adhesions assays, irrigation studies, and bactericidal assays determined that benzalkonium chloride showed the greatest efficacy. Testing involved stainless steel screws colonized with a preformed biofilm of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were immersed in benzalkonium chloride solutions for various time intervals under static conditions. After 10 minutes, benzalkonium chloride achieved a minimum 4 log kill (10,000-fold) for all 3 strains of bacteria. Additional studies demonstrated that the high mechanical energy of jet irrigation improved the disinfecting properties of this agent. With jet lavage, both 1:1000 and 1:5000 concentrations of benzalkonium chloride achieved a minimum 2 log kill (100-fold) for all 3 bacteria. The results or this study suggest that at tissue compatible concentrations, benzalkonium chloride has significant disinfection properties for in vitro colonized orthopaedic devices, and these properties may be enhanced via jet lavage.
TI  - Inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa rhamnolipids in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Patients with cystic fibrosis often have chronic and ultimately lethal pulmonary  infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to understand why these bacteria resist pulmonary clearance, we have investigated the interaction of P. aeruginosa and phagocytic cells. In an earlier study we reported that sub-lytic concentrations of two glycolipids produced by P. aeruginosa (the mono- and dirhamnolipids) caused structural changes in human monocyte-derived macrophages, and at lower concentrations inhibited the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis by these cells. In the present study we demonstrate that rhamnolipids also inhibit the in vitro phagocytosis of both P. aeruginosa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae by thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages. Using lucifer yellow to label the lysosomal compartments of macrophages, we determined that rhamnolipids interfere with the internalization of attached particles and reduce the level of phagosome-lysosome fusion of internalized targets within macrophages. We also demonstrate that physiologically relevant concentrations of rhamnolipids injected intratracheally into rat lungs inhibited the response of alveolar macrophages to a challenge of zymosan particles in vivo. These studies further demonstrate the profound inhibitory effects of P. aeruginosa rhamnolipids on macrophage function and are consistent with our hypothesis that the in situ production of these rhamnolipids directly contributes to the persistence of this pathogen in cystic fibrosis patient lungs.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1994). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 567 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1994 to May 1995. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 26.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 73.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis. Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC) and biapenem (BIPM) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA. VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) were not so active with the MIC90s of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis. MINO showed the strongest activity against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. ABK was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Cephems were active with the MIC90s of 2 approximately 16 micrograms/ml, but penicillins and quinolones were not so active with the MIC90s and 64 approximately 128 micrograms/ml. 4. Citrobacter freundii. Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activities against C. freundii isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. IPM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 5. Enterobacter cloacae. IPM showed the highest activities against E. cloacae. Its MIC90 was 0.5 microgram/ml. GM and amikacin (AMK), ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tosulfloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except latamoxef (LMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90s of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Escherichia coli. Most of antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. CPR, CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), flomoxef (FMOX) CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), and LMOX were also active with the MIC90s of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneumoniae. CRMN showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae. Its MIC90 was < or = 0.125 microgram/ml. CZOP was also active with the MIC90 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90s of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Proteus mirabilis. P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, CAZ, LMOX, CRP, cefpodoxime (CPDX), CRMN, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90s of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MINO was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90s of 16 micrograms/ml or above. CPFX showed MIC50 of 0.5 microgram/ml.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - Bleed of and biologic response to triglyceride filler used in radiolucent breast  implants.
AB  - Radiolucent breast implants filled with triglyceride oil have recently entered limited clinical trials. To investigate the questions of oil bleed and the fate of triglycerides that might escape from ruptured breast implants, experiments reported here used peanut oil labeled with radioisotopes so that it could be traced in the urine, feces, and organs of two groups of rabbits. In one experiment, 18 rabbits were implanted with peanut oil-filled implants labeled with tritium to determine whether triglycerides diffuse across silicone elastomer shells. In another experiment, 19 rabbits were injected with 14C-labeled peanut oil to study what might happen to the oil if an implant ruptures. At the end of the follow-up period, we measured radioisotope levels in tissue samples taken from the periprosthetic capsule or injection site of each rabbit, as well as from major organs and the subcutaneous fat on the dorsum opposite the experimental site. One experiment revealed that triglycerides do bleed across the implant shells. Tritium levels were highest in the implant capsule, the omentum, the aorta, and the subcutaneous fat on the nonexperimental side. In the experiment simulating implant rupture, 14C levels were above the background radiation count at the injection site and in the same tissue sites as in the bleed experiment. Both in vivo radiolabeling studies indicate that triglycerides freed from implants by means of bleed or rupture would be absorbed, metabolized, and either excreted or redistributed to the body's normal fat storage sites if they are not needed for energy. In a third in vitro experiment, triglyceride oil specimens were inoculated with various microorganisms associated with wound infections: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and diphtheroids. The data demonstrate that neutral triglycerides used as a breast implant filler do not support growth of common infection-producing bacteria and suggest that triglycerides may have bactericidal properties.
TI  - Effect of adhered bacteria on the binding of Acanthamoeba to hydrogel lenses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus  epidermidis on the binding of Acanthamoeba species to hydrogel lenses. METHODS: Cells of amebae and bacteria were incubated with different types of hydrogel lenses. Densities of amebae that were bound to the lenses after rinsing were determined from direct counts with a cell detachment procedure and from scintillation counts of cells, which were radiolabeled with tritiated leucine. RESULTS: With both methods, amebae showed significantly increased binding to hydrogel lenses with attached P aeruginosa. The numbers of amebae that were retained on lenses with attached S epidermidis were not significantly different from those that were retained on lenses without bacteria. The binding of amebae to unworn hydrogel lenses, in contrast to the irreversible adherence of P aeruginosa, was tenuous. CONCLUSIONS: The binding of Acanthamoeba species to unworn hydrogel lenses was tenuous and appeared to be related to water content, surface tensions, and ionic charge. The presence of adhered P aeruginosa on the hydrogel lenses facilitated the binding of Acanthamoeba species. The cocontamination of lens systems with bacteria (eg, P aeruginosa) may be a prime factor in the development of amebic keratitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [Multicenter study of isolated micro-organisms resistant to antimicrobials in 10  Portuguese hospitals in 1994].
AB  - In 1994, Microbiology Laboratories of ten Portuguese hospitals analysed isolated  microorganisms found in blood and urine samples and studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of the most frequent bacterial pathogens. From 63780 blood samples, the most frequent were Staphylococcus spp. and from 69189 urine samples significant numbers of Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida spp. were isolated. Escherichia coli strains (c.7000) revealed a low percentage of resistance to antibiotics with the exceptions of ampicillin (48%) and co-trimoxazol (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (c.2000) revealed important resistance to ampicillin (98%), cephalotin (31%), co-trimoxazol (38%) and gentamicin (28%), while values for 3rd generation cephalosporins varied among hospitals, with several strains showing phenotype of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. A great variation in resistance values of P. aeruginosa (c.4000) was found in relation to the antibiotics as well as to the hospitals. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus (c.6000) was high, reaching an average of 47%, and it was even higher with S. epidermidis (c.3000) and S. haemolyticus (c.650). Only vancomycin was always active against these strains. In E. faecalis (c.2500) resistance was of 2% to ampicillin, 35% to gentamicin, 45% to streptomycin and 1% to vancomycin. E. faecium isolates (c.300) showed the most worrying results with 70% resistance to ampicillin, 42% to gentamicin, 59% to streptomycin and 9% (30 strains isolated in 5 hospitals) to vancomycin. Vancomycin resistant strains were also resistant to all other antibiotics.
TI  - Variations in the fluorescence intensity of intact DAPI-stained bacteria and their implications for rapid bacterial quantification.
AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often  imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identify bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.
TI  - [Nosocomial bacterial infection in comprehensive intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of nosocomial bacterial infection and changes in resistance in a comprehensive intensive care unit. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all the bacterial isolates of ICU, PUMC Hospital from 1989 to 1994, such as the species and resistance pattern. RESULTS: Among all bacterial isolates, the percentage of Gram-positive cocci steadily increased (16% in 1989, 33% in 1994), while that of Gram-negative bacilli decreased (84% in 1989, 67% in 1994). The most prevalent isolates of Gram-negative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, inducible Enterobacteriaceae and Xanthomonas maltophilia, with imipenem and amikacin as the most susceptible antibiotics. Enterococci, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 44%, 21% and 10%, respectively. The resistant rate of these three Gram-positive bacteria to vancomycin were 19%, 0% and 0%. CONCLUSION: Understanding of the epidemiological data and changes of bacterial resistance profile is prerequisite to rational use of antibiotics, which is crucial to reducing the resistance of nosocomial infection pathogens.
TI  - Influence of temperature on mutational resistance to 4-quinolones.
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ciprofloxacin (CAS 85721-33-1),  ofloxacin (CAS 82419-36-1) or levofloxacin (CAS 100986-85-4) against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were determined at 37, 30 and 25 degrees C on nutrient agar. With E. coli and S. aureus, reducing the incubation temperature from 37 to 30 to 25 degrees C decreased the MIC values for each drug. With P. aeruginosa, temperature reduction also decreased the MIC values for ciprofloxacin but increased the MICs for ofloxacin or levofloxacin. With S. epidermidis, temperature reduction increased the MICs for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin but with levofloxacin the MICs were identical at 37 or 25 degrees C but higher at 30 degrees C. Mutants of these bacterial species were selected on nutrient agar containing five times their respective MICs of the 4-quinolones at 37, 30 and 25 degrees C. with S. epidermidis, temperature reduction always reduced its mutation frequency to resist 4-quinolones, whereas with the other three species the effect of temperature was more variable, and in some instances even elevated their mutation rates.
TI  - Bacterial growth in saline implants: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - The survival of bacteria was evaluated in custom-made saline breast implants with integral injection ports in vitro and in 10 New Zealand White rabbits for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens. Pseudomonas and Serratia survived in vitro in saline-filled implants and multiplied 24-fold and 22-fold, respectively, from the initial inocula of 300 colony-forming units per cubic centimeter in 21 days. Serratia alone survived in saline implants placed on the dorsum of rabbits, proliferated 80-fold in 7 days, and tapered to 10-fold at the end of 3 weeks. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of glucose in fluid from the implants in the animal study (mean, 1.2 mg per deciliter; standard error of mean [SEM], 0.6) after 21 days and from human subjects (mean, 3.8 mg per deciliter; SEM, 1.0) after 8 months to 10 years. Serratia incubated in human breast implant fluid samples proliferated 7-fold to 30-fold greater than in the saline control in a nonaerated environment. We conclude that some bacteria are able to proliferate in saline in breast implants. Furthermore, their survival may be facilitated by a substance (i.e., glucose) that diffuses across the implant outer shell.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of LB10517, a novel catechol-substituted cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - LB10517 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial  activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. LB10517 inhibited 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) at 0.25 mg/L (MIC90), and was 8-fold more active than cefpirome. LB10517 was two- or four-fold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. Both methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) were highly resistant to all compounds. LB10517 activity against most Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to or greater than that of cefpirome, and it also showed high activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a mouse septicaemia model, LB10517 exhibited excellent protective effects. In a respiratory tract infection model, the protective effect of LB10517 was comparable to that of cefpirome and ceftazidime. It was highly stable to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases, showing better physiological efficiency for TEM-9 than the other test compounds. LB10517 had the most potent antibacterial activity against beta-lactamase producing resistant strains. LB10517 did not induce beta-lactamase production in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to orthopedic implant polymers.
AB  - The degradable polymers poly(orthoester) (POE), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLA), and the nondegradable polymers polysulfone (PSF), polyethylene (PE), and poly(ether ether ketone) (PEEK) were exposed to cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Escherichia coli. Bacteria washed and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) adhered to polymers in amounts nearly twice those of bacteria that were left in their growth medium, tryptic soy broth (TSB). In TSB, there was variation in adhesion from species to species, but no significant variation from polymer to polymer within one species. In PBS there were significant differences in the amounts of bacteria adhering to the various polymers with the exception, of S. epidermidis, which had similar adhesion to all polymers. As a whole, P. aeruginosa was the most adherent while S. epidermidis was the least adherent. The estimated values of the free energy of adhesion (delta Fadh) correlated with the amount of adherent P. aeruginosa. When POE, PLA, and PSF were exposed to hyaluronic acid (HA) before exposure to the bacteria, there was 50% more adhesion of E. coli and P. aeruginosa on POE and PLA. With respect to bacterial adhesion, the biodegradable polymers (POE and PLA) in general were not significantly different from the nondegradable polymers.
TI  - Removal of surface bacteria by irrigation.
AB  - We examined the efficacy of various irrigation solutions delivered through a power irrigator to remove bacteria from three different surfaces. Titanium, stainless-steel, and cortical bone surfaces were coated with three different bacterial species: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. They were then irrigated with 1 L of fluid delivered by jet lavage. The fluids tested were normal saline and solutions of bacitracin, neomycin, and soap. One set of specimens was not irrigated, as a control. After irrigation, the specimens were sonicated to remove residual bacteria, and the sonicate was quantitatively cultured to allow evaluation of the amount of residual bacteria on the surface. The results showed that removal of bacteria reflects an interaction between bacterial species, surface characteristics, and irrigation solution. Fewer bacteria were present in all the irrigation groups than in the control. Soap solution was as good as or better than any other solution at removing all three types of bacteria from all three surfaces, although not all of the pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. There was a significant advantage to soap solution over antibiotic irrigant or saline alone in removing Staphylococcus epidermidis from metallic surfaces. The use of soap solution for irrigation seems to improve the removal of some bacteria from some surfaces in this experimental model and may represent a better type of irrigation additive.
TI  - Bacterial changes in neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Organisms routinely cultured from throat swabs and infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis were reviewed. During the last 12 years, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been replaced by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the predominant isolates from throat swabs after admission. These change in the etiologic pattern of infectious agents of sepsis and/or meningitis, i.e., K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, were in agreement with the organisms isolated from the throat swabs after admission. The S. aureus isolated from throat swabs after admission showed a decrease in the bacterial activity of cloxacillin, cephazolin and cefotaxime since 1978.
TI  - Survival of nosocomial pathogenic bacteria at ambient temperature.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus and many gram-negative rods are prevalent nosocomial pathogens. The mechanisms by which these organisms persist and spread within the hospital environment have not been clearly defined. We found that these bacteria have an extraordinary capability for survival in the environment. The viabilities of staphylococcal and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolates were assessed on three environmental surfaces: a non-nutrient surface, a woven cotton fiber, and a blood protein coagulum. The bacteria were dried on these surfaces and quantitatively subcultured over six months. The viability was consistently higher on dried blood surfaces. Viability was next highest on cotton strings. For both of these environments, staphylococci appeared to lose viability between three and six months, while E. coli and P. aeruginosa survived longer. Survival on a clean non-nutrient surface (tubes alone) for all organisms was much briefer and did not extend beyond four weeks. Such extended survival on blood and fiber surfaces, as observed in part, explains the difficulty in controlling colonization of patients by and spread of these nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Effect of microwaves on survival of some bacterial strains.
AB  - While the inhibitory effect of microwave radiation on microorganisms is being researched intensively, how microwave radiation brings about this effect has been a matter of discussion. Some researchers support that this effect is of a thermal character, whereas some others maintain a non-thermal effect. In this work, 1 ml suspensions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas acidovorans staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria were subjected to microwave radiation at 2450 MHz and 550 Watts for periods of 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25 and 30 seconds. When each result was compared with the CFU/ml results obtained from unradiated control group bacterial suspensions derived from stock cultures, significant conclusions were attained (P < 0.001). The same experiments were repeated with the application of conventional heating. The difference between the CFU/ml values of similar bacterial suspensions subjected to microwave radiation and conventional heating was significant (P < 0.001). Concurrently, the fact that the effect was exacerbated upon increasing of liquid volume during the application of microwave radiation was established via the results obtained through the application of microwave radiation to 1 ml and 5 ml bacterial suspensions (P < 0.001).
TI  - [Clinical experience with a new antimicrobially coated InterGard-IgK/AM vascular  prosthesis in surgical treatment of deep wound infection with involvement of the synthetic bypass: report of 2 cases].
AB  - We report 2 cases of infected vascular prosthesis, where the infected alloplastic material was removed and the revascularisation of the lower extremity was done by implantation of the new antimicrobial surface-coated InterGard prosthesis in the area of the former infected graft. An extra-anatomical bypass was not promising in these cases. Clinical, bacteriological and granulocyte-scintigraphic examinations have provided no evidence for persisting infection 12 and 11 months after implantation of this prosthesis. We are aware that the postoperative observation periods are too short to allow definitive assessment. Nevertheless we still consider that this prosthesis means a new and promising option in the treatment of infected vascular graft.
TI  - [Ten-year experience with the use of ofloxacin in the treatment of wound infection].
AB  - The experience with ofloxacin used for 10 years from 1986 to 1995 in the complex  therapy of 208 patients with wound infection complicated in 51 patients (24.5 per cent) by respiratory tract infection such as purulent tracheobronchitis or pleuropneumonia was generalized. In 28 patients (13.5 per cent) persistent bacteriuria not susceptible to the routine drugs was stated. The clinical and bacteriological efficacies of ofloxacin in the group of the patients with noncomplicated purulent wounds of the soft tissues amounted to 85-91 and 74-80 per cent respectively. In the group of the patients with wound infection complicated by respiratory or urinary tract infection the clinical and bacteriological efficacies equaled 94-100 per cent. The appetite disorder, epigastric pain or nausea were rare. Only in 3 cases the adverse reactions required the treatment discontinuation. Despite the use of ofloxacin for many years, the susceptibility of the main causative agents of surgical infections to the drug remained high: Staphylococcus epidermidis 93.3 per cent, Staph.aureus 94.5 per cent, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 96.5 per cent, Escherichia coll 100 per cent, Proteus spp. 100 per cent, Enterobacter spp. 100 per cent, Acinetobacter spp. 82.3 per cent and Klebsiella spp. 88.8 per cent. The successive use of ofloxacin, at first intravenously for 3-5 days and then orally in the form of tablets for 3-5 days, in the treatment of 15 patients with wound infections of various genesis and localization subjected to osteoplastic reconstructive operations provided positive effects in all the cases and was economically advantageous.
TI  - [Chronic osteitis--modern therapy].
AB  - The results of the clinical trials with ofloxacin in the treatment of osteitis are presented. The drug was used according to 3 regimens: 200 mg thrice a day, 200 mg twice a day and 400 mg once a day for 6 to 24 months. The disease diagnosis was based on the bacteriological investigation of the biopsy specimens and hemocultures. The isolates were shown to be susceptible to ofloxacin. The majority of the patients (78 per cent) was treated with ofloxacin after the preliminary surgical operations. The treatment was started with the ofloxacin intravenous administration in a dose of 400 mg followed by the drug oral use in the same dose once a day for at least 14 days. The most frequent causative agents were: Staphylococcus aureus (52 per cent of the cases) and Staph.epidermidis (13.7 per cent of the cases) which were eradicated in 91.7 and 93.9 per cent of the cases respectively when the ofloxacin MICs were 0.26 and 0.22 mg/l respectively. The number of the gram-negative isolates on the whole amounted to 72.56 per cent and that of the gram-negative isolates amounted to 27.46 per cent of all the pathogens. As for the latter Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. were the most frequent (11.14 and 5.4 per cent respectively). The eradication of the pathogens amounted to 80.6 and 94.43 per cent respectively when the drug MICs were 1.78 and 0.42 mg/l respectively. The regimen with the drug oral use in a dose of 400 mg once a day proved to be the most expedient. It provided the complete therapeutic effect, minimum cost and maximum comfort for the patients.
TI  - Bacterial flora of the nasal cavity in laryngectomized patients.
AB  - In laryngectomized patients, the nose does not function. The absence of a physiological airflow stimulus leads to clinical, cytologic and histologic changes of the nasal mucosa. The aim of this study was to identify the nasal cavity bacterial flora in these patients and to determine whether or not it undergoes changes with time. In a group of 25 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken before, and 8 days and 1 month after the surgery. In a group of 15 patients, the nasal mucosa swabs were taken 1 to 2 years postoperatively.
TI  - Residual bacterial infection in the tympanic cavity following surgery for ears with chronic discharge.
AB  - In surgical treatment of ears with chronic discharge, pathogenic microorganisms may remain in the middle ear even after meticulous tympanomastoidectomy, and cause recurrent infection unless an appropriate antimicrobial agent is administered. The present study was conducted to determine the incidence of residual bacterial infection in the tympanic cavity by examining secretions from a drainage tube placed there via the mastoid cavity during surgery. Comparison of the bacterial flora before and after surgery demonstrated that some of the microorganisms continued to be present in the tympanic cavity for up to 2 weeks despite medication, and that the incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis remained fairly high.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in open fractures].
AB  - The administration of antibiotics is now generally accepted as a prophylactic treatment of infection in compound fractures. Nevertheless the question is not completely resolved and many problems are still to be discussed.The efficacy of antibiotherapy in this field has just been recently demonstrated ; with the animals by Worlock et al. (1988) using an experimental rabbit model, and clinically by Braul et al. (1987) which randomized 87 patients with open fractures to receive either cloxacillin or placebo. The rate of infection was significantly lower in the antibiotic group.No reports comparing various antimicrobial drugs draw effective conclusions regarding the choice of antibiotics. In the same way it seems that the time of interval from injury to antibiotic administration was not associated with a significantly different incidence of infection.The study of duration of the treatment was perfectly conducted by Dellinger. In his prospective trial 248 patients received different doses of the same antibiotic, from a single dose to four doses daily during 5 days. In conclusion he found no relation between the duration of the treatment and the risk of infection.A semantic but very important question concerns the reality of a preventive action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures. In order to answer, it is necessary to assess the incidence of contamination, its nature and its density.According to papers reporting the results of early cultures of the fracture wound, bacterial contamination was present in 30-70% of the cases. But the bacteria most commonly isolated were members of the normal skin flora (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium sp. Micrococcus) or environmental contaminants which infrequently were the cause of infection.The specimens taken from patients who have an infection show mostly hospitalacquired bacteria as Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings emphasize the risk of colonization of the wound by nosocomial bacteria.In addition, it seems that the density of contamination may also be a determinant of subsequent clinical infection. Quantitative bacterial counts suggest a greater risk of infection when microorganisms were present in high number more than 105 colony forming unit per g. of tissue.In conclusion, the prophylactic action of antibiotics against infection in open fractures is well established, but many points are still subject to discussion and need further study. Furthermore antibioprophylaxis is only a complement to surgical treatment, debridement and immobilization, which remains of paramount importance.
TI  - Endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis after radial keratotomy.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the findings concerning three patients with endophthalmitis and one with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis radial keratotomy surgery. METHODS: One man referred with panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis and three women referred with endophthalmitis were treated. RESULTS: After radial keratotomy surgery, during which no microperforation or macroperforation had been reported, a severe Pseudomonas panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis developed in the man. All vision was lost in that eye. Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis developed in one woman, Streptococcus pneumoniae endophthalmitis in the second woman and Pseudomonas endophthalmitis in the third woman, after undergoing radial keratotomy procedures during which microperforations occurred. In the latter patient, bilateral simultaneous surgery was performed, but only one eye became infected. The latter two infections resulted in light perception and hand motion vision respectively. In three cases, an initial keratitis was located in the inferior cornea. CONCLUSIONS: Severe bacterial endophthalmitis can occur after radial keratotomy surgery, even in the absence of microperforation during the procedure. Any evidence of postoperative keratitis must be regarded seriously and treated aggressively. Despite use of this approach, the effect on final visual acuity can be devastating.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters containing low concentrations of silver: a new perspective in prevention of polymer-associated foreign-body-infections.
AB  - In modern medicine, infection is one of the most serious complications of implanted plastic devices. The host is not able to overcome this special type of opportunistic infection despite having a normal immune response and a low virulence of most of the bacteria involved. Antimicrobial therapy alone generally cannot cure the infection and the removal of catheters often remains the only choice of therapy. Bacterial adhesion to the polymer surface of the catheter, be it luminal or external, is an important step in the pathogenesis of catheter-associated infections. In this report, we describe new approaches to the prevention of infections by impregnation of polyurethane and silicone with silver by two different methods. The antimicrobial activity of these silver-impregnated catheters is more than 10 fold higher for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) compared to catheters without silver. Similar results are obtained with other microbial organisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The new polymers show no cytotoxic or thrombogenic side effects in vitro.
TI  - [Survey bacterial isolates from blood samples during 1987-1993 in our department].
AB  - We analyzed the changes in frequency of bacterial isolates from the blood samples in our department from May 1987 to December 1993. 565 isolates from 4887 samples (11.6%) were detected. Among the detected microorganisms, the rate of gram-positivecocci (GPC) was much higher than the other kinds of the isolates each year. Especially, 80-90% of GPC were occupied by only 2 kinds of microorganisms, coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) and S. aureus. Among gram-negative-rods (GNR), constant increase of S. marcescens and transient increase of Enterobacter and P. aeruginosa were recognized. In 30 cases (5.3%), 2-3 kinds of microorganisms were isolated concomitantly, and in 55 cases (9.7%), the microorganisms, which was mainly caused by CNS, S. aureus and Candida, was isolated from both blood samples and the tip of the IVH catheter concomitantly. 42.5% of the bacterial positive cases in 1933 underwent 2 more kinds of the indwelling catheters and 48.3% were administrated antibiotics. Most of the cases had underlying diseases including mainly malignant tumor (leukemia, solid tumor), cerebrovascular diseases, and multiple injuries.
TI  - Contamination of multi-use closed tracheal suction catheters: an in-vitro study.
AB  - The use of closed multi-use tracheal suction systems in ventilated patients is increasingly popular as it offers a number of potential physiological and microbiological advantages. As the use of these systems has been associated with an increased prevalence of tracheal colonization, effective self-cleaning mechanisms employed in these catheters are necessary. Using an in-vitro model we assessed the degree of catheter colonization in two multi-use catheter systems; Stericath and Trach-Care. Fifty of each catheter type were tested for colonization with five challenge organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 6571); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NCTC 10662); Haemophilus influenzae type b; S. epidermidis (slime producer); and S. epidermidis (slime non-producer). All five challenge strains had colonized both catheter types after 24 h and all 100 catheter tips were colonized. The extent and density of colonization was variable and interspecies variation in the pattern of catheter colonization was observed. The mean colonized lengths of Stericath catheters was 10.9 +/- 1.4 cm and of Trach-Care 2.7 +/- 1.3 cm (P < 0.0001).
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994.

Flomoxef (FMOX), cefmenoxime (CMX), CZOP, IPM, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX), CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefuzonam (CZON) and latamoxef (LMOX) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae Most of the agents were active against K. pneumoniae. FMOX, CMX, CZOP and CRMN showed the highest activities. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. But ampicillin (ABPC) was not so active with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 9. Proteus mirabilis Most of the agents were active against P. mirabilis. FMOX, CMX, CAZ, CZON, LMOX, CFIX, CPDX, CRMN, NFLX, CPFX and TFLX showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. ABPC and MINO were not so active with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 10. Pseudomonas aeruginosa Most of the agents were not so active against P. aeruginosa. IPM showed MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml. Cefclidin (CFCL) and AMK showed MIC90S o
TI  - Causes of suppurative keratitis in Ghana.
AB  - AIMS: Suppurative keratitis is a serious problem in all tropical countries, but very little information is available about the causative organisms in Africa. The objectives were to identify the causative organisms and the proportion of cases caused by fungi in southern Ghana, and to determine whether correct decisions about treatment could be made on the basis of Gram stain in the eye clinic. METHODS: Scrapings were taken from corneal ulcers of consecutive new patients presenting at Korle Bu Hospital, Accra, and inoculated on 'chocolate' and Sabouraud's agars. Further scrapings were taken for Gram staining and interpretation in the eye clinic. Duplicate slides were assessed by an experienced microbiologist in the UK. RESULTS: One or more organisms were cultured from 114 of 199 patients (57.3%), the most common being Fusarium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Fungi, alone or in combination, were isolated from 56% of the patients who had positive cultures. In total, 122 patients (61.3%) had their treatment either determined or altered based on the results of the microbiological diagnosis; in 87 of these solely on the basis of direct microscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS: Infection by filamentous fungi accounted for more than half of the ulcers from which cultures were obtained. Both training in technique and experience in interpretation are necessary for microscopy based diagnosis by staff in the clinic to be of greatest value. Direct microscopy was particularly useful for detecting fungi.
TI  - Bacterial peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: effect on dialysis on host defense mechanisms.
AB  - We have used an experimental model of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to investigate the effect of dialysis on host defense mechanisms in the peritoneal cavity. Laboratory rats undergoing regular dialysis were challenged with a single bolus of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Intraperitoneal challenges with all four microbial strains underwent a rapid clearance during the first 4 hours, irrespective of whether the host was undergoing dialysis. Studies using S epidermidis showed that the rapid clearance was not mediated by the diaphragmatic stomata as might have been expected. Dialysis did, however, cause delays over the following 48 hours with all of the pathogens except C albicans. Bacterial clearance over a 10-day period was strain dependant, and microbial persistence was related to adhesion formation around the cannula. Again C albicans was an exception. Our conclusions are that dialysis does not affect the innate defense mechanisms involved in the early clearance of a bolus challenge to the peritoneal cavity but can cause delays in eradicating microorganisms that survive this phase. Because these experiments were carried out using a bolus inoculum, it may be necessary to reevaluate the effect of dialysis on host defenses in the peritoneal cavity under conditions in which the challenge more closely approximates a touch contamination event.
TI  - Adherence of organisms to silver-coated surfaces.
AB  - Pure silver-, silver oxide- and silver chloride-treated surfaces in comparison to polypropylene inhibited both growth and adherence from saline of Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. These same organisms demonstrated enhanced adherence to an Ion-Beam-Assisted-Deposited silver surface followed by loss of viability. This type of surface in contrast to the other silver surfaces did not produce zones of inhibition in agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Quantification of the ease of removal of bacteria from surfaces.
AB  - This paper describes a technique which reproducibly quantifies the ease of removal of microorganisms from surfaces. Tiles (22 mm x 22 mm) of various materials were colonised with Staphylococcus epidermidis NCTC 11047, Escherichia coli K12 HB101 or Pseudomonas aeruginosa PaWH, by submersion, for various times (2 min-48 h), in inoculated Tryptone Soya broth (37 degrees C). Colonised tiles were blotted onto a Tryptone Soya agar plate for 1 min and the process was repeated through a succession of agar plates. The final plate contained tetrazolium salts (0.05% w/v) and was incubated in situ with the tile. Tetrazolium plates indicated that very few organisms remained on the tiles after 15 successive blots. In all instances, the number of recovered colonies per plate decreased exponentially with plate succession number, according to the relationship, CFU = A.10-kN, where CFU is the number of colonies transferred, k is the removal exponent, A is the intercept and N is the plate succession number. Removal exponents differed significantly between organisms (P > 0.95), depended on the nature of the test surface, and decreased as the inital attachment and colonisation time was increased from 2 min-48 h. Intercept values (A) but not the gradients were dependent upon the initial numbers of bacteria in suspension. These data indicate that the gradients derived from counting recoverable viable cells from successive blots of test tiles onto agar is a measure of the strength of attachment of the organisms to the surface.
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of Isolator and BACTEC 9240 Aerobic/F resin bottle for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was carried out with the BACTEC 9240 Aerobic/F resin bottle and the Isolator system with adult patients suspected of having bloodstream infections. A total of 10,500 paired specimens were collected, of which 1,122 from 520 patients were positive. There were 68 false-positive BACTEC bottles; 259 positive cultures that were excluded from analysis because the bottle, the Isolator, or both failed to meet the minimum volume criterion of 8 ml of blood; and 207 positive cultures that were excluded because the isolates were found to be clinically insignificant or of indeterminate clinical significance on the basis of patient assessment. A total of 656 positive cultures from 258 patients formed the basis of the analysis. Significantly more Staphylococcus aureus isolates (P = 0.03), Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates (P = 0.03), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P = 0.03), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (P = 0.04) were recovered from the resin bottle, and there was no category of organism that was recovered significantly more frequently from the Isolator system. With patients receiving antibiotics at the time of blood culture, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and gram-negative bacilli were recovered significantly more frequently from the resin bottle. No significant differences between systems were found with cultures from patients not receiving antibiotics at the time of blood culture. Only 12 clinically significant organisms were recovered from the bottle on terminal subcultures, and only 1 of these had not been previously isolated from another blood culture set (10 of the 12) or from the companion Isolator (1 of 12). The Aerobic/F resin bottle continuously monitored in the BACTEC 9240 instrument proved to be superior to the Isolator in overall yield of organisms causing bloodstream infection in adults and required less technician time for specimen processing and examination than the Isolator system.
TI  - The impact of bacteraemia on HIV infection. Nine years experience in a large Italian university hospital.
AB  - The object of this case control study was to evaluate the frequency, the risk factors, the microbiological spectrum and the outcome of 249 cases of bacteraemia observed in 209 HIV-infected patients, most them affected by AIDS. The rate of bacteraemia in the total yearly HIV-related admissions increased from 4% in 1985 to 13% in 1993. The more common aetiological agents of bacteraemia were: Staphylococcus aureus (29.7%), non-typhoidal species of Salmonella (14.1%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (10.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%). A mixed flora was found in 14% of the episodes. Multivariate analysis of predisposing factors indicated that a low CD4+T-cell count (<0.2 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.01), use of central venous catheters (CVC) (P=0.01) and neutropenia (polymorphonuclear neutrophils <1.0 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.04) were independent risk factors for the development of bacteraemia. Logistic regression did not reveal any association of bacteraemia with intravenous drug abuse (on univariate analysis P=0.04). The response (31.8%). Recurrences to specific therapy was favourable in 170 episodes (68.2%); death occurred in 79 (31.8%). Recurrences arose in 40 patients, 17 (42.5%) of them died. The outcome of bacteraemia was influenced by a low number of CD4+T-cells (P<0.001) but not of polymorphonuclear cells. Our findings suggest that bacteraemia is a relatively common event in HIV-infected patients, especially under particular conditions (e.g. intravenous drug abuse, use of CVC, neutropenia and a low CD4-T-cell count). It requires special attention from physicians who must recognise and treat the condition promptly at an early stage.
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. DESIGN: A multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Animal research laboratory of a university medical center. SUBJECTS: One hundred sixty-five Balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. INTERVENTIONS: Nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, or Candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms E. coli lipopolysaccharide O26:B6. One week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed E. coli/Bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. In parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The three Gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. These effects were not seen with the Gram-positive cocci or with C. albicans. Pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal exposure to some Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. In the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. The presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1989). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 1,032 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1989 to May 1990. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. 1. Enterococcus faecalis Imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with urinary tract infections. The followings, ampicillin (ABPC) and vancomycin (VCM) showed potent activities, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. Piperacillin (PIPC), minocycline (MINO) and chloramphenicol (CP) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The others were not so active with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus VCM showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. Dicloxacillin (MDIPC) and arbekacin (ABK) were active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. MINO showed the MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. All other agents except ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed lower activity. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis MINO showed the highest activity against S. epidermidis. Its MIC90 was 0.25 microgram/ml. The followings, ABK and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others except CPFX were not so active. 4. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) Most of the agents were active against CNS. IPM, ABK and MINO showed the highest activities with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. MDIPC, cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml. Clindamycin (CLDM) showed lower activity, with the MIC90 of 128 micrograms/ml. 5. Streptococcus agalactiae CEZ, cefuzonam (CZON), IPM and CLDM showed the potent activity, all strains were inhibited at the MIC of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. The followings, cefmenoxime (CMX) and erythromycin (EM) were active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. PIPC and VCM were also active with the MIC90S 0.25 microgram/ml and 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively Amikacin (AMK) showed lower activity. Escherichia coli IPM, CTM, flomoxef (FMOX), CMX, carumonam (CRMN), norfloxacin (NFLX), ofloxacin (OFLX) and CPFX showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were .125 microgram/ml or below. ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZON were also active with the MIC90S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Penicillins except mecillinam (MPC) were not so active showing the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Klebsiella pneuminiae FMOX, CMX, cefixime (CFIX), IPM, CRMN and NFLX showed the highest activities against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Effectiveness of pefloxacin in the surgical clinic].
AB  - Pefloxacin (Rhone-Poulenc, France) was used prophylactically and therapeutically  in 8 and 21 surgical inpatients respectively. The majority of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were susceptible to pefloxacin (91 to 100 per cent). The isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible (77 and 33.3 per cent respectively). The isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were mainly susceptible to the drug. The high antimicrobial activity of pefloxacin used therapeutically well correlated with the favourable time course of the main disease. When pefloxacin was used prophylactically the results were positive in all the cases. The drug tolerance in the majority of the cases was good. Only 2 patients developed allergic reactions as multiple minipunctate rash. After discontinuation of the drug use and short-term course of the desensitization the clinical sings of the allergic reactions disappeared in 3 days.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbial keratitis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posterior segment complications of systemic infection with the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are well recognized. The anterior segment complications often are, however, overlooked. The author treated 20 episodes of nonherpetic infectious keratitis in 17 eyes of 13 patients infected with HIV who presented between August 1990 and May 1994. METHODS: Review of records. RESULTS: Nine patients were women, and four were men. Mean age was 35.2 years. The keratitis was bilateral in four patients, polymicrobial in four, and recurrent in two. The most common infecting organism was Candida albicans (5 eyes), a rare cause of keratitis in immunocompetent individuals. Other organisms included Staphylococcus aureus in four eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in four, Bacillus sp in two, and one each Pseudomonas aeruginosa, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Micrococcus sp, and Capnocytophaga sp. Seven eyes retained 20/30 or better visual acuity after treatment, eight had visual acuity of 20/50 or worse, and two were eviscerated. Classic predisposing factors for infectious keratitis were found in only two patients and included contact lens wear and atopy in one patient each. Twelve patients had a history of intravenous drug abuse. CONCLUSION: Infectious keratitis should be recognized as a complication of systemic HIV infection, especially in the context of drug abuse. The prognosis for recovery of vision in these patients often is poor.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of sulperazone on multi-resistant strains of bacteria from burn wounds].
AB  - Sulperazone (SLP), a combination of sulbactam (beta-lactamase inhibitor) with cefoperazone (CFP), was studied in vitro for its sensitivity to multi-resistant strains of bacteria isolated from burn wounds. The results showed that the sensitive rate of gram-negative bacteria to SLP was 77.3% (n = 163), higher than that of CFP (45.0%, n = 169) (P < 0.01). The rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa which was common among the gram-negative bacteria was 88.9% (n = 45), much higher than that of CFP (71.7%, n = 46) (P < 0.05). The rate of bacterium anitratum was 100%, and it was resistant to CFP (P < 0.01). The sensitive rate of gram-positive bacteria to SLP was 37.5% (n = 128) but to CFP was 24.6% (n = 126) (P < 0.05). The rate of staphylococcus aureus which was common in gram-positive bacteria was 42.6% (n = 61), much higher than that of CFP (21.3%, n = 61) (P < 0.05). It is indicated that sulbactam inhibits most beta-lactamases produced by common bacterial pathogens and makes antibiotics restore the sensitivity to resistant strains. Sulperazone is promising in the treatment of burn infection.
TI  - Removal of infected dual chambered transvenous pacemaker and implantation of a new epicardial dual chambered device with cardiopulmonary bypass: experience with seven cases.
AB  - Seven patients with infected transvenous dual chambered pacemakers have undergone removal of the device using cardiopulmonary bypass. There were four women and three men with a mean age of 58 years. Six patients had localized infection in the generator pocket (mean of 4.6 previous unsuccessful operations for surgical sterilization). Four infections were due to Staphylococcus epidermidis, two to Staphylococcus aureus, and one patient presented septicemia caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The atrial and ventricular transvenous electrodes were removed under direct vision using cardiopulmonary bypass. A new dual chambered epicardial pacemaker was implanted. The procedure was well-tolerated, and all patients are infection free with working pacemakers after a mean follow-up of 25.4 months.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - A novel antibiofilm technology for contact lens solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including sodium salicylate, inhibit extracellular bacterial biofilm production. The authors studied the effect of the addition of sodium salicylate on bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on contact lenses and cases and commonly used medical polymers. METHODS: The study was done in vitro with bacterial adherence and biofilm measured on lenses and cases that were exposed to saline contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with and without 1 and 3 mm sodium salicylate. Bacterial adherence to contact lenses was quantitated by a vortex assay and by scanning electron microscopy. Biofilm formation on contact lens cases and other polymers was measured by an optical density assay and a radiolabeling assay. RESULTS: Inhibition of biofilm formation was demonstrated on plastic contact lens cases in a dose-related manner with 1 and 3 mm sodium salicylate. A dose-related decrease in bacterial adherence also was noted. Assays with contact lenses also demonstrated less adherence in the presence of sodium salicylate. Electron micrographs of the contact lens showed less biofilm, most noticeable with 3 mm salicylate. Other studies demonstrated decreased adherence of S. epidermidis to polyethylene and polystyrene. Sodium salicylate also decreased biofilm on plastic tissue culture wells, but sorbic acid paradoxically increased deposition. CONCLUSION: The authors found that the addition of low-dose sodium salicylate to saline decreased the adherence of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa to contact lenses and lens cases. Biofilm production also was decreased on the lens cases and on medical polymers used to make plastic cases. These studies suggest that sodium salicylate deserves additional study to determine its use in contact lens solutions.
TI  - Cefotaxime for treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by systemic signs and symptoms, and bacteremia during the first month of life. The incidence is relatively low (one to eight cases/1000 live births), yet the risk of mortality is approximately 25%. Meningitis in the neonate is usually a sequela of bacteremia; however, it is discussed with neonatal sepsis, because they commonly share etiology and pathogenesis. The incidence of meningitis is usually a fraction of the number of infants with sepsis, varying in different settings from one-fourth to one-third. The mortality rate is high, varying in some series from 15%-50%. There are two major forms of presentation of neonatal sepsis. Early-onset disease presents as a fulminant, multisystemic illness during the first 5-7 days of life; late-onset disease is more commonly recognized after the first weeks of life. Because different microorganisms are responsible for the two forms of disease, the choice of antimicrobial agents also differs. Some organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Listeria monocytogenes may be responsible, whereas other pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are usually associated with late-onset disease. Classic initial (empiric) treatment of neonatal sepsis and meningitis consists of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. With the advent of the third-generation cephalosporins, however, the empiric antimicrobial approach for neonatal sepsis and meningitis has changed in most centers. Third-generation cephalosporins cover more of the pathogens implicated in neonatal sepsis and meningitis, except for the enterococci and L. monocytogenes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacteria in surface infections of neonates.
AB  - A bacteriological work on surface infections was done among live births (study group I) and neonates admitted in hospital (study group II). Out of 134 cases of conjunctivitis in group I Gram-negative bacilli predominated (48.5%) with Escherichia coli accounting for 29 (14.9%) cases, Klebsiella species 15 (11.2%) cases, Citrobacter freundii 3 (2.2%) cases, Pseudomons aeruginosa 18 (13.4%) cases and Aeromonas hydrophila 3 (2.2%) amongst pure isolates (73.9%). Gonococcus was noted in 2 (1.5%) cases. In group II, 41.7% were Staphylococcus aureus in pure growth (75%), compared to only 9.0% in group I. Skin infections were caused by both Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the principal insolates from umbilical sepsis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated as pure growth from local site of noma neonatorum. Anaerobic cultures were negative in all except in 2 cases of umbilical sepsis with tetanus neonatorum revealing Clostridium tetani which however proved to be non-toxigenic. Blood cultures were positive in 4 out of 14 cases bearing 50% correlation with bacteria from surface infections. A source study established partial correlation with the cases of pseudomonas conjunctivitis. Phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus and biochemical typing failed to detect any definite marker of clinical entities, except that the skin infections were caused by group III phages predominantly (65.0%).
TI  - A comparative study of the microbiologic effectiveness of chemical disinfectants  and peroxide-neutralizer systems.
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial activity of chemical and hydrogen peroxide-neutralizer contact lens disinfection systems. The acute activity, storage, and recontamination potential of the two disinfection methods were compared by challenging the disinfectants with Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida spp., and Aspergillus fumigatus. Chemical disinfectants preserved with polyquaternium-1 and polyhexamethylene biguanide and hydrogen peroxide-neutralizer systems with no additional preservatives were tested. Additionally, lens cases from patients using both systems were evaluated. Lens cases from patients using peroxide-neutralizer systems tended toward heavier contamination (31.8%) than the cases disinfected with a chemical system (20.3%, P = 0.16). The laboratory results showed that the differences in activity of chemical and peroxide-neutralizer systems was not statistically significant at the disinfection times against Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. marcescens, Candida parapsilosis, and A. fumigatus (P = 0.1037 to P = 0.5412). A statistical difference was shown against C. albicans (P = 0.0176) in favor of the peroxide-neutralizer systems. The reverse was true during storage. Although the chemical disinfectants maintained the population of microorganisms, the bacteria and yeast increased to over 10(7) CFU/mL in neutralized peroxide systems. Overall, the results emphasize the importance of contact lens products containing preservatives for lasting protection from microorganisms.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteremia in neutropenic children with cancer.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria have been the predominant organisms causing bacteremia in  febrile neutropenic cancer patients during the past decade. Recently we have noted an increase in Gram-negative bacteremia in children and adolescents with cancer. Therefore we retrospectively reviewed 153 episodes of bacteremia during a 6-year period to investigate changes in the etiology of bacteremia in pediatric oncology patients. In the early 3-year period (January, 1988, to December, 1990) Gram-positive organisms comprised 73 (74%) of the 99 isolates, and Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common isolate. In the later 3-year period (January, 1991, to December, 1993) Gram-negative organisms were seen with greater frequency and represented 50% of isolates (P = 0.004). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated organism during this period (22% of all isolates). We speculate that the recent utilization of more intensive chemotherapy regimens has caused an alteration in the epidemiology of bacteremia in children and adolescents with cancer which could influence the initial empiric antibiotic regimens and the outcome of such infections.
TI  - Effect of inflammation on intraocular penetration of intravenous ofloxacin in albino rabbits.
AB  - The effect of inflammation on the intraocular penetration of ofloxacin was studied in 20 albino rabbits (New Zealand White). Inflammation was induced in the left eye by inoculation of a suspension of 10(9) CFU of heat-killed Staphyloccus epidermidis per 0.1 ml of saline solution (0.9%) in the midvitreous cavity. The other eye was kept as a control. Twenty-four hours following inoculation, ofloxacin was administered in the marginal ear vein at a dose of 15 mg/kg over 20 min with an infusion pump. Animals were sacrificed at different times up to 24 h following drug administration. Ofloxacin levels were determined in aqueous humor, vitreous humor, and serum by a bioassay. Inflammation was scored on the basis of perilimbal and corneal reactions and vitreoretinal statuses. Inflammation had a relevant effect on intraocular penetration of ofloxacin, with levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye markedly exceeding the ones of the control eye. In the uninflamed eye, the levels were rapidly decaying below assay sensitivity and were no longer detectable at approximately 5 h following drug administration while they were still detectable in both ocular fluids of the inflamed eye at 24 h. Ofloxacin levels in the ocular fluids of the inflamed eye were superior to the MIC for several of the bacteria which commonly cause endophthalmitis, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - In vivo effects of urease-producing bacteria involved with the pathogenesis of infection-induced urolithiasis on renal urokinase and sialidase activity.
AB  - Many hypotheses have been proposed for renal stone formation. It has been argued  that with infection-induced renal stones the hydrolysis of urea by bacterial urease increases urinary pH, with consequent stone formation. Unfortunately, this theory is not applicable to the micro-organisms that do not produce urease (e.g. Escherichia coli). It has been recently reported that E. coli reduces the urinary urokinase activity of male rats, but does not influence the urinary sialidase activity. This study has now been expanded to the urease-producing bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Micrococcus luteus. Subcutaneous injections with these bacteria were found to significantly (P < 0.003) reduce the UK activity of extrarenally obstructed kidneys. The urease-producing mammalian skin bacterium, M. luteus, was, however, the exception (P = 0.1079). In contrast to S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa and M. luteus (P < 0.0213), P. mirabilis and S. aureus had no effect on renal sialidase activity (P < 0.4047). These results may explain why Proteus species are predominant in infection-induced renal stones. According to the urokinase-sialidase hypothesis, a decrease in urinary urokinase activity should increase the uromucoid levels, whilst no effect on the urinary sialidase activity should favour conversion of urinary uromucoid to mineralizable matrix. These conditions may lead to renal stone formation. An increase in urinary pH resulting from urease-producing micro-organisms will increase salt precipitation on the uromucoid. It is thus concluded that urease-producing bacteria may play a double role in renal stone formation.
TI  - The effect of ultraviolet rays on the prevention of exit-site infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to show that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin around the catheter exit site (ES) could inhibit its infection. First, bacterial cultures of swabbed fluid from the ES were obtained from 68 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) outpatients six times during the 24-month observation period. Second, the bactericidal effects of UV irradiation on the catheter ES were examined. The results were as follows: (1) In spite of disinfection of the catheter ES by the strict application of povidone-iodine once or twice a day, 23%-45% of the cases were found to be micro-organism positive. The most prevalent micro-organisms from the catheter ES were, in order of highest to lowest prevalence, Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). (2) In the nasal cavity SA was detected in 20%-25% of patients. There was a high incidence of ES infection among the SA nasal carriers. (3) UV irradiation was performed in 18 cases that constantly revealed bacteria on culture at the catheter ES. Ten cases (55%) became culture-negative, 3 cases showed a microbial decrease, and 5 cases remained unchanged. These results suggest that UV irradiation can eliminate bacteria and can be of prophylactic use for ES infections.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol-GS, a preservation  medium for donor corneas.
AB  - Increasing reports of gentamicin-resistant bacteria contaminating donor corneas and causing endophthalmitis have indicated that preservation of corneal storage media with 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin alone needs reevaluation. We investigated the stability and possible cytotoxicity of streptomycin as a supplement to gentamicin in Optisol corneal storage medium. The combination of gentamicin and streptomycin in Optisol solution was stable at room temperature for at least 4 weeks and inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, alpha hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus Group D, Propionibacterium acnes, Escherichia coli, and diphtheroids, but not Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The addition of vancomycin did not significantly improve the antibacterial effectiveness of the gentamicin and streptomycin combination when stored at 4 degrees C. The growth of 15 of 20 clinical ocular isolates of Ps. aeruginosa was suppressed by the gentamicin-streptomycin combination. Streptomycin in concentrations of up to 1,000 micrograms/ml did not decrease the mitotic activity of corneal endothelial cells as evaluated by the in vitro incorporation of tritiated thymidine or cause cytotoxicity. The addition of 200 micrograms/ml of streptomycin to Optisol corneal storage medium containing 100 micrograms/ml of gentamicin may significantly improve activity against gentamicin-sensitive and gentamicin-resistant contaminants.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of two commercial RGP contact lens care systems.
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of two rigid gas permeable (RGP) lens care systems, a one-step wetting and soaking system (0.005% chlorhexidine gluconate, 0.02% EDTA) and a conditioning solution (0.006% chlorhexidine gluconate, 0.05% EDTA). The formulations were individually inoculated with approximately 10(6) CFU/mL of a pathogenic organism. Both the one-step wetting and soaking system and the conditioning solution demonstrated good antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the one-step wetting and soaking system provides better disinfection against Candida albicans (1.2 log reduction in 4 hours) than the conditioning solution (0.39 log reduction in 4 hours). The one-step system also reduced S. marcescens by 5 logs in 1 hour, whereas the conditioning solution reduced S. marcescens by about 2 logs only in the same time interval. Although both RGP lens care systems use the same active preservative (chlorhexidine digluconate), the variation in disinfecting activities may be attributed to differences in formulation and buffer systems.
TI  - Sternal wound infection: our experience with 200 cases.
AB  - More than 200 patients with sternal wound infections have been treated in the Plastic Surgery Department of our Medical Center over the years 1984-1993. Most of these were referrals from other hospitals. In recent years, the cases have become more severe, partially due to the fact that cardiac surgeons tend to operate older and sicker patients more readily than they previously did. 80% of these were post coronary bypass surgery, and the others heart and heart-lung transplants, repair of congenital heart anomalies, valve replacements etc. Several of the cases were cardiac surgery re-do's. Risk factors for developing this complication, such as diabetes, obesity, technical errors of sternal incision, prolonged intubation, the use of aortic balloon, etc. will be discussed. Many of our earlier patients had chronic fistulae following conservative therapy with old treatment modalities. In recent years, patients are usually referred at the acute stage. Most patients undergo removal of sternum and ribs. Previously, reconstruction included mainly transfer of the rectus ahdominis muscle, whereas lately the pectoralis muscles is utilized. Omentum was used in only one case. The importance of pre-operative imaging procedures has been thoroughly studied in our series. Especially important is the definition of the extent of the infection, and localization of foreign bodies causing chronic infections, such as suture material, epicardial electrodes etc. A change in infectants has also been noticed. In the first half of the study period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa comprised at least 40%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Pacemaker endocarditis. Report of 44 cases and review of the literature.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical course, microbiologic spectrum, and risk factors for endocarditis and for associated mortality in a large series of patients with documented pacemaker endocarditis. Using a computerized search through the medical records of 10 major hospitals in Israel from 1982 to 1992, and carefully reviewing the charts, we identified 44 patients with pacemaker endocarditis. The cases were categorized as definite (n = 25), probable (n = 12), or possible (n = 7) infective endocarditis based on strict case definition. Fever and chills were the most common symptoms. Increased ESR, leukocytosis, microscopic hematuria, and anemia were the most common laboratory findings. A relatively high proportion of the patients were diabetic. The most common source of endocarditis was infection acquired by the placement procedure or infection of the pacemaker pouch. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features were similar to those of endocarditis patients of a similar age range without pacemakers, although the frequency of fever and chills was higher in our patients than in those patients and splenomegaly, vascular embolic phenomena, and new or changing murmurs were rare in our patients. The major pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, similar to other series of pacemaker-associated bacteremia and similar to the microbiologic findings of early prosthetic-valve endocarditis. However, this microbiologic profile is different from that of native-valve endocarditis. Although the present series did not show a statistically significant advantage to electrode removal over conservative treatment, when analyzed together with pooled data from other studies, it suggests that the surgical approach is preferable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Ultrasonic enhancement of antibiotic action on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The effect of gentamicin upon planktonic cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus was measured with and without application of 67-kHz ultrasonic stimulation. The ultrasound was applied at levels that had no inhibitory or bactericidal activity against the bacteria. Measurements of the MIC and bactericidal activity of gentamicin against planktonic cultures of P. aeruginosa and E. coli demonstrated that simultaneous application of 67-kHz ultrasound enhanced the effectiveness of the antibiotic. A synergistic effect was observed and bacterial viability was reduced several orders of magnitude when gentamicin concentrations and ultrasonic levels which by themselves did not reduce viability were combined. As the age of the culture increased, the bacteria became more resistant to the effect of the antibiotic alone. Application of ultrasound appeared to reverse this resistance. The ultrasonic treatment-enhanced activity was evident with cultures of P. aeruginosa and E. coli but was not observed with cultures of gram-positive S. epidermidis and S. aureus. These results may have application in the treatment of bacterial biofilm infections on implant devices, which infections are usually more resistant to antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Surveillance of multidrug-resistant environmental bacteria].
AB  - The multidrug-resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was surveyed. The multidrug-resistant S.epidermidis isolated accounted for 18% of the total S.epidermidis (1991.4 to 1992.3) and were frequently isolated from specimens of the urine and respiratory system. The polymerase chain reaction revealed the existence of the mec A gene in S.epidermidis showing various degree of antibiotic resistance, suggesting that S.epidermidis is in the process of achieving multidrug resistance. The multidrug-resistant P.aeruginosa were isolated from 14.6% of the total P.aeruginosa (1993.5 to 1993.8) and were most frequently isolated from the urine. Most of the multidrug resistant P.aeruginosa showed serotype E, suggesting the relationship between serotype and acquirement of drug resistance. Pulsefield electrophoresis of SpeI digested P.aeruginosa genomic DNA showed a characteristic pattern and the genome pattern should be applicable for the epidemiology.
TI  - Epidemiology of infection in ICUs.
AB  - Patients admitted to ICUs are at the greatest risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, partly because of their serious underlying disease, but also by exposure to life-saving invasive procedures. Nosocomial infections increase patient morbidity, increase the length of hospital stay and hospital costs, and may increase mortality rates. When serious infections are suspected, treatment must be commenced immediately to increase the likelihood of a satisfactory outcome for the patient. Empirical knowledge, to select appropriate antibiotics, must be used so that the most likely infecting organisms are treated. In the past this has meant that antibiotics with activity against Gram-negative pathogens were most likely to be selected. However, infections where Gram-positive pathogens are responsible (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococci) are increasingly being found. The European Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care Study (EPIC), the largest point-prevalence study of infection in ICUs in Western Europe was carried out on 28 April 1992. Data on 10,038 patients in 1417 adult ICU departments from 17 countries was collected and analysed. Of the ICU patients surveyed, 21% had at least one infection acquired in an ICU. The most common infections acquired in an ICU were pneumonia (47%), other infections of the lower respiratory tract (18%), infections of the urinary tract (18%) and infections of the blood-stream (12%). The bacterial isolates were equally divided between Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. The commonly reported bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae (34%), S. aureus (30%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%) and enterococci (12%).
TI  - [Experimental study on the role of bacteria from urinary tract infections on the  bladder carcinogenesis].
AB  - The role of bacteria isolated from patients with urinary tract infection (UTI) was studied with a view to the possibility that such bacteria are an etiological factor in the development of bladder cancer. The bacterial strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis, isolated from patients with UTI at the Kyushu University Hospital, were tested for their nitrate-reducing activity after 1 hr of incubation with sodium nitrate (3.57 mM) in a growth medium (pH 7.2) at 37 degrees C. Of 35 strains tested, 27 strains (77%) showed the ability to reduce nitrate to nitrite with yields ranging from 2 to 310 microM NO2-/hr/10(7) bacterial cells, but in 8 strains (23%) including all the 7 strains of E. faecalis no elevated activity (0.0-0.3 microM) could be detected. Various kinetic profiles were observed for the nitrate-reducing bacteria, at various rate ranging from rapidly to slowly, during 5 hr of incubation. The effect of nitrate-reducing bacteria on mutagen formation in the human urine was examined. The mutagenic activity of smokers' or non-smokers' urine incubated with or without bacteria for 72 hr at 37 degrees C was assayed by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test (using TA100 or TA98 with S9-mix). The mutagenic activity increased in urine incubated with the nitrate-reducing S. marcescens or P. aeruginosa, compared to controls which were incubated without bacteria. Potent mutagenic activity could be induced when the urine concentrate prepared from smokers' urine with an XAD-2 resin column was incubated with sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 3 for 4 hrs. The potent mutagenic activity observed here seems to be due to the class of direct-acting mutagen(s), because no metabolic activation was required. The mutagen formation at an optimal pH 4 proceeded rapidly during 4 hrs of incubation, but decreased thereafter. It was noted that even at a physiological pH 6 of human urine, a lower but significant level of mutagenic activity could still be detected. The mutagenic activity of individual urine concentrate from 14 male smokers and from 6 male non-smokers was assayed after 30 min of incubation with or without sodium nitrite (40 mM) at pH 6. Mutagenic activity increased in most of these urine concentrates incubated with sodium nitrite. The levels were variable between individuals with a 1.3- to 53-fold increase compared with the controls incubated without sodium nitrite.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Anti-bacterial antibodies in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed oligoclonal B-cell lines established from normal persons and autoimmune disease patients.
AB  - We have established 950 and 430 oligoclonal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from two normal persons and eight autoimmune disease patients, respectively by using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced transformation. To re-evaluate the EBV technique for production of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) related to infectious disease, we screened these oligoclonal LCLs for antibodies against 31 bacterial strains systematically. A total of 74 cultures out of 1380 were reactive to a total of 18 strains out of 31. Among these, eight cultures showed 10(-3) antibody (Ab) titers to Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes C, E, F and I, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens and Bacillus cereus. Ten cultures showed 10(-2) Ab titers to Ps. aeruginosa serotypes D, E, F and I, Ps. maltophilia, Staph. epidermidis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ser. marcescens and B. subtilis. The results reveal the further possibilities for the EBV technique to produce various infectious disease-related human mAbs.
TI  - [Transperitoneal resorption of cefotiam in CAPD patients with and without peritonitis].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cephalosporins of the second generation have been repeatedly recommended for the treatment of peritonitis associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), because they are effective against most of the clinically relevant bacteria. In this study, we tested cefotiam, a member of this group of antibiotics, for its suitability in this indication, and determined the intraperitoneal dosage needed to achieve effective serum levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN 10 CAPD-patients with and 10 without peritonitis, cefotiam was added to the dialysis bags (2 l) over a period of seven days. Prior to initiating antibiotic treatment, a sample of dialysis fluid was submitted to bacteriological and cytological examination. During the treatment period, the bags were changed four times a day. In the first three patients 0.5 g cefotiam/bag was administered. Two to four days after initiating treatment, these patients developed nausea and occasional vomiting. Thereupon, all the other patients were given a dose of 0.5 cefotiam/bag only on the first day--a loading dose--followed by 0.25 g/bag for the next six days. Samples of blood and dialysate were obtained after 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours. The cefotiam concentration was determined by the agar diffusion technique. Side effects were checked by clinical observation and measurement of GOT, GOP, alkaline phosphatase, gamma GT, Na, K, and creatinine together with a blood count at the beginning and end of the trial. RESULTS: Among the peritonitis patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus were each found in four, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two patients. In all patients effective serum levels were reached after one day of treatment. In the following period, these levels were maintained. Serum concentrations were higher in patients with than in those without peritonitis (18 to 21 micrograms/ml and 11 to 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). The first three patients had toxic cefotiam levels of about 30 micrograms/ml. All the cases of staphylococcus-induced peritonitis were cured with this therapeutic regimen, while those with Pseudomonas aeruginosa peritonitis required additional treatment with tobramycin. Neither clinical nor chemical side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Using the regimen described, cefotiam is an effective and safe first-line antibiotic for the treatment of CAPD-related peritonitis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal RNA gene probe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. Various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. A recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal DNA bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rRNA probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. At each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 CFUs per mL. At one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. Inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. A total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). RESULTS: This assay was, in some cases, able to detect S. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 CFUs per mL; the majority of samples (B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) CFUs per mL; and all samples with contamination of 2.1 x 10(5) CFUs per mL or greater. Increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 mL to 1.0 mL resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). CONCLUSION: The routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. Further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rRNA probe is employed to detect bacteria in the pool.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on combined effects of fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone for mixed infections of MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa].
AB  - The time-lag/sequential/step by step chemotherapy by fosfomycin plus sulbactam/cefoperazone including a short time small dose of steroid was done for 27 severely infected patients suffered from various cancer or other severe basal diseases. And the staggered "intensive" chemotherapy with added arbekacin or vancomycin to the previous staggered chemotherapy was done against 13 severely infected patients having MRSAs among their infecting pathogens. 1. Bacteriological effects Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6/8, Staphylococcus epidermidis 5/5, Enterococcus faecalis 3/6, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 2/2, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2/2, MRSA 2/2, Xanthomonas maltophilia 2/3 and other 10/10 were eradicated (84.2%) by the staggered chemotherapy and MRSA 7/13, P. aeruginosa 3/4, E. faecalis 3/5, A. calcoaceticus 2/2, X. maltophilia 1/1 and others 2/2 were eradicated (53.8% in MRSA, 78.6% in others and 66.7% in total) and 3 of MRSAs were colonized. 2. Clinical effects 1) Staggered chemotherapy: Excellent 18/27, good 8/27, fair 1/27, poor 0/27 (96.3%). 2) Staggered "intensive" chemotherapy: Excellent 6/13, good 4/13, fair 2/13, poor 1/13 (76.9%) in total: excellent 60.0%, efficacy rate 90.0%.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate administration dose of arbekacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in the disk susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of arbekacin (ABK) against various clinical isolates, 335 strains obtained in 1991, were determined and the reliability of the ABK disk susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of two different systems for the interpretation of the disk tests was evaluated as to which system would be more useful for the evaluation of clinical efficacy of ABK. The 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy were studied. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC90 values of ABK against Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 3.13 micrograms/ml. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp., were also < or = 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC90 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia spp. were both 50 micrograms/ml. The disk susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disk manual. The inhibition zones obtained with the disk method were compared with MICs. Results of ABK disk susceptibility test with 30, 10, 5 or 2 micrograms disks were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disk method in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.627 approximately -0.724, P < 0.01). In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values of ABK proposed are (+ + +) MIC < 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC > 3-10 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC > 10-50 micrograms/ml and (-) MIC > 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms disks showed false positive in 13.4%, and false negative in 3.9% of the samples. With 10 micrograms disks, false positive and false negative were 8.1%, and 3.9%, respectively. Similarly, those with 5 micrograms and 2 micrograms disks were 6.9% and 7.2%, and 3.0% and 14.6%, respectively. In the break point classification system of Japanese Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, the MIC break point for ABK proposed is 2 micrograms/ml. It appeared to be difficult to make out this break point on the inhibition zone diameters obtained with various disks used, since there were no significant difference in the inhibition zone diameters against strains with MIC values ranging 0.39-3.13 micrograms/ml. A pharmacokinetic examination with the recommended dose schedule for ABK (100 mg i.m. or i.v.) showed that plasma levels of ABK reached 3.7-11.3 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility of a silver-coated central venous catheter.
AB  - Central venous catheter infection presents an important problem in modern medicine, leading sometimes to a life-threatening situation for the patient as well as contributing to prolonged hospital stay and to an increase in costs. We have evaluated the in vitro biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of a silver-coated polyurethane catheter designed for use as a colonization-resistant, antiinfective catheter. Due to a comparatively low silver release, the catheter performed well in cell toxicity and blood compatibility tests as well as in acute toxicity tests done with mice. The antimicrobial activity was tested in stationary and dynamic bacterial adherence experiments using S. epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa as test strains. The silver-coated polyurethane catheter showed good ability to prevent microbial colonization of the catheter surface. Currently a clinical trial of the silver-coated catheter is under investigation.
TI  - Assessment of microbial growth in intravenous immune globulin preparations.
AB  - The ability of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) products to support bacterial and yeast growth was studied. Microtiter plates containing preparations of eight commercially available IVIG products were inoculated with 10(5) colony-forming units (CFUs) of bacteria per milliliter or 10(3) CFUs of yeast cells per milliliter. The organisms used were Candida albicans, Torulopsis glabrata, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The plates were incubated at 3, 25, or 37 degrees C for seven days. For each organism and each temperature, a total of 16 identical wells were studied per preparation. Optical density was measured at 24-hour intervals to determine bacterial growth; yeast growth was determined visually. None of the IVIG preparations supported bacterial growth at any temperature over the seven-day period. No preparation supported visible yeast growth at 3 degrees C; however, most of the preparations did support yeast growth at 25 and 37 degrees C. The failure of the IVIG preparations to support bacterial growth at all temperatures and yeast growth at 3 degrees C suggests that a reconsideration of recommended expiration dates for IVIG products may be warranted.
TI  - Effect of the inoculum size on susceptibility tests performed on sessily growing  bacteria.
AB  - It has been clearly established that the inoculum size greatly affects the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests performed in both liquid and solid media in standard laboratory growth conditions (i.e. planktonic). Recently methods were developed to perform antibiotic susceptibility tests on bacteria growing in sessile conditions. The present study investigates the effect of the inoculum size on results obtained by these methods. Results show that the inoculum size does not affect tests performed in sessile conditions. A simple and reliable method is proposed to be applied to routine microbiological laboratory procedures.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - Development of bacterial biofilms on silastic catheter materials in peritoneal dialysis fluid.
AB  - A modified Robbins' device was used to monitor the growth of bacteria associated  with clinical peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis fluid. To simulate bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on peritoneal catheters, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli were allowed to adhere to silastic disks and were then grown in fresh or used dialysis fluid. Adherent bacteria formed microcolonies and biofilms on silastics within 4 to 24 hours. Our data showed that colonization of the silastic disks was related to the quantity of bacteria and there were significant differences between the growth of adherent bacteria in fresh and used dialysis fluid. Adherent S epidermidis and P aeruginosa grew better in dialysis fluids than adherent E coli. These results suggest that S epidermidis and P aeruginosa are more likely to colonize silastic catheters and to cause catheter-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients than E coli.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - Association between thrombosis and infection.
AB  
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin (TFLX) was compared with those of other new quinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and fleroxacin) against clinical isolates. These isolates had been collected from May to June 1993 (22 species, 260 strains) and from June to July 1992 (Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 87 strains) in Toyama municipal hospital. TFLX showed the most potent activities against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli in 1993, at MIC50 levels. The MIC50's of TFLX for these species ranged from 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml. TFLX showed potent activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and the MIC50's of TFLX were 0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. However, new quinolone resistant strains (MIC > or = 6.25 micrograms/ml) were found among some species. Especially, the number of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains resistant to new quinolone exceeded 60% of all the S. aureus isolates in 1993. More MRSA strains resistant to new quinolones were isolated in 1993 than in 1992, and similar result was observed for P. aeruginosa. The coagulase typing was done, and all MRSA strains of resistant to new quinolones produced coagulase type II.
TI  - Infection after insertion of alloplastic orbital floor implants.
AB  - Ten patients developed infections after alloplastic implantation (nine silicone,  one gelatin film [Gelfilm] implant) for orbital floor fracture repair. Infection resulted from the following: (1) dental surgery, (2) upper respiratory infection, (3) inferior extrusion of a retained implant into the maxillary sinus with a fistulous tract into the inferior conjunctival fornix, (4) rhinoplasty, (5) snorting cocaine and other drugs, (6) postoperative infection after orbital floor repair, and (7) medial implant migration resulting in chronic dacryocystitis. In all ten patients, implants were removed because of orbital abscess, recurrent infection, or chronic low-grade infections. Microbiologic culture of removed implants disclosed Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the offending organisms. The main complication of infection included severe cicatricial ectropion of the lower eyelid in three patients. The final globe position was not adversely affected by implant removal performed from five months to 20 years after insertion. Guidelines for prevention and management of orbital implant infections based on these ten patients are presented.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of platelets at a university hospital: increased identification due to intensified surveillance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A cluster of bacterial contamination of platelets occurred at a university hospital in a one-month period. This unusual clustering allowed us to examine the likely mechanism of contamination and clinical sequelae. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of patients receiving random donor platelet transfusions to determine numbers of platelets transfused, reactions reported, and episodes of bacterial contamination. We also reviewed procedures at the collecting blood agencies and the hospital blood bank. RESULTS: Four patients received bacterially contaminated platelets during June and July 1991. The rates of reported platelet transfusion reactions increased significantly (P < 0.001) from September 1989 through July 1991 (study period); in addition, the rate of contamination of platelets during June and July 1991 was 23-fold higher than during the previous 21 months (P < 0.001). Surveillance methodology changed dramatically during the study period, contributing to the recognition of the current cluster. Pathogens isolated from the contaminated platelet pools were Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in titers ranging from 10(6) to 10(8) colony forming units/mL. Four constituent individual platelet units identified as the probable cause of the outbreak (including one postepidemic episode) were significantly older (mean age, 4.8 days) than 106 randomly selected individual platelet units (mean age, 3.7 days; P = 0.04). Platelet pools were transfused an average of 2.5 hours after pooling. Review of blood collection and platelet preparation practices did not identify breaks in procedure or technique that could have caused contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness of platelet transfusion reactions by clinical staff and routine culturing of all platelets associated with transfusion reactions will identify contaminated platelets. Identification of contaminated platelets is necessary to treat affected patients appropriately and to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for contaminated platelets (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1994;15:82-87).
TI  - Loofah sponges as reservoirs and vehicles in the transmission of potentially pathogenic bacterial species to human skin.
AB  - Loofah sponges are natural products used as exfoliative beauty aids. As a consequence of tracing a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa folliculitis to a contaminated loofah sponge, we assessed the role of loofah sponges in supporting the growth of a wide variety of bacterial species. Our data show growth enhancement of sterile loofah fragments for numerous gram-negative (Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, and Klebsiella) and gram-positive (Enterococcus and group B Streptococcus) species of human and environmental origin. Furthermore, hydrated new, unused loofah sponges undergo a shift in bacterial flora from sparse colonies of Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus epidermidis to a predominantly gram-negative flora. The growth-promoting potential of loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can be further augmented by desquamated epithelial cells entrapped in the loofah fibrous matrix. Therefore, as loofah sponges (and other exfoliatives) can serve as a reservoir and a vehicle for the transmission of potentially pathogenic species to the human skin, we recommend their decontamination with hypochlorite (10%) bleach at regular intervals.
TI  - [Statistic studies on bacteria isolated from urinary tract infections (report 6:  isolation rate and drug sensitivity from 1988 through 1989)].
AB  - We examined the bacteria isolated from urine of patients in our department from 1988 though 1989. A total of 809 strains were isolated from the outpatients. They were 241 strains of gram-positive bacteria (29.8%). E. coli (32.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by Enterococcus spp. (9.9%), Proteus group (7.4%), S. epidermidis (6.2%), P. aeruginosa (5.1%) and others. A total of 412 strains were isolated from the inpatients. They consisted of 173 strains of gram-positive bacteria (42.0%). Enterococcus spp. (17.0%) was isolated most frequently, followed by P. aeruginosa (12.6%), S. epidermidis (9.7%), E. coli (7.3%), S. aureus (6.6%) and others. Fewer P. aeruginosa, S. marcescens and Proteus group were isolated from the outpatients and fewer S. marcescens, E. coli and K. pneumoniae from inpatients than previously. More S. aureus were isolated abruptly from the inpatients and more E. coli were isolated from the outpatients than previously. E. cloacae, S. epidermidis, S. aureus and Corynebacterium spp. all isolated from inpatients showed lower antimicrobial sensitivity than those isolated from the outpatients.
TI  - An antimicrobial effect associated with rabbit primary aqueous humour.
AB  - Viability curves were recorded for a variety of bacteria suspended in rabbit primary aqueous humour. Controls included neat rabbit serum, dilute rabbit serum (1/50), dilute heat treated fetal bovine serum (1/50), and balanced salt solution. Rabbit aqueous humour was bactericidal in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Micrococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were not affected. The factor mediating the bactericidal effect survives filtration (0.2 micron porosity) and freezing in liquid nitrogen (-196 degrees C) but is labile when stored in air at temperatures of 4 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for 1 hour. The bactericidal effect was stable when aqueous humour was stored in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C for 3 hours. The antibacterial component in rabbit aqueous humour has yet to be identified.
TI  - Differential binding capacity and internalisation of bacterial substrates as factors in growth rate of Acanthamoeba spp.
AB  - Acanthamoeba spp. are free-living predators that selectively feed on bacteria. Adherence of the bacterial food source to the trophozoite membrane is followed by internalisation and digestion. Through co-cultivation of A. castellanii and A. polyphaga, individually, with Xanthomonas maltophilia, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (despite the amoebicidal properties of the latter organism), specificity with regard to the preferred bacterial substrate was judged. X. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa adhered almost immediately forming a multilayered mantle of bacilli around trophozoites of both species of amoebae. E. coli adhered to fewer trophozoites and in smaller numbers. X. maltophilia was readily internalised after co-cultivation for 8 h, whereas P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. epidermidis were not internalised even after co-cultivation for 24 h. These data suggest that the suitability of a bacterial food source for the Acanthamoeba spp. studied is associated not only with the proclivity with which the bacterial species binds to the trophozoite surface, but also with the rate of its internalisation.
TI  - Isolation, identification and sensitivity pattern of microorganisms isolated from the urine of pregnant women.
AB  - The present studies were conducted to detect and identify the microorganism from  the urine of pregnant women having urinary tract infection. The antibiotic susceptibility of these isolated microorganisms was also determined. The microorganisms found responsible for the infection were bacteria, fungi, yeast and protozoa. Among the bacteria two were identified as Gram-positive cocci i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, the remaining two were Gram-negative bacilli which were Escherichia coil and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fungus was identified as AspelEillus niger and the yeast like fungus Candida albican. The only protozoan found in some of the urine samples was Trichomonas vaginalis. These isolated and identified microorganisms were more susceptible to Norfloxacin, Velosef, Minocin, Nitrofurantoin, Malidixic acid and Metronidazole whereas antibiotics Penbritin and Cefaloridine were least effective against these microorganisms.
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Prevalence of urinary tract infection among school children in a Nigerian rural community.
AB  - A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence of urinary tract infection (UTI) among primary school children in Awka Local Government Area of Anambra State between March and July, 1987. The asymptomatic survey was carried out by random screening of 100 urine samples of healthy pupils (50 boys and 50 girls) aged between 4-16 years. Results of the survey showed that 6 boys (12%) and 24 girls (48%) were positive for the infection. At the General Hospital, Awka, 100 urine samples of children (34 boys and 66 girls) who came to the hospital complaining of loin pain were studied. Out of this number, 10 boys (29.4%) and 47 girls (71.2%) gave positive results. In so-called healthy children (asymptomatic cases) Pseudomonas aeruginosa was of high incidence in both boys (33.3%) and girls (25.0%) while P. vulgaris occurred only in boys (16.7%). In symptomatic cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis was of the highest incidence: 30.0% in boys and 27.6% in girls. Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Streptococcus fecalis and Candida albicans were isolated only from girls in both cases.
TI  - The role of HSV-induced Fc- and C3b (i)-receptors in bacterial adherence.
AB  - Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) induces Fc- and C3b(i)-receptors on infected  cells. The role of these receptors in bacterial superinfection was studied by comparing the adherence of non-opsonised and opsonised bacteria to HSV-infected and non-infected HEp-2 cells. A flow cytometric adherence assay, based on the fluorescent quantitation of FITC-labelled bacteria, was developed. Opsonisation of Staphylococcus epidermidis with human serum, resulted in a marked increase in adherence to HSV-infected cells and revealed a role for C3b(i)R- and FcR-mediated adhesion. However, the enhanced adherence never exceeded the level of attachment to non-infected cells. Increased adherence of other pathogenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not observed, indicating that the HSV-receptors play a minor role in secondary infections. Bacterial adhesion factors such as the fimbriae of E. coli played a more dominant role in the adherence of bacteria to HSV-infected cells.
TI  - [Opsonizing activity of human immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous use (IVIG)].
AB  - It was shown that all the examined immunoglobulin preparations (IVIG) enhance growth of opsonization of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli which was studied using the chemiluminescence method. However, no opsonization growth was observed of P. aeruginosa rods with the participation of IVIG (except for Sandoglobulin and the specific immunoglobulin Pseudomonas). We assume that such a result was due to the P. aeruginosa strain's susceptibility to lysis factors of the human serum used in the experiment as the complement source. It was confirmed that phagocytosis with the participation of IVIG measured by the chemiluminescence test requires the presence of a complement. The bactericidal test showed that all IVIG preparations, Pentaglobin in particular, are bactericidal and active against P. aeruginosa. Basing on the results obtained, we believe that the biological activity of the Polish preparation is comparable with the investigated IVIG preparations from foreign firms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of cytotoxic drugs may influence isolation of bacteria and fungi from blood cultures.
AB  - The potential antimicrobial activity of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and adriamycin against Gram positive and negative bacteria and Candida albicans was examined. The time taken for different microbial inocula to turn a simulated blood culture positive in the presence of different concentrations of these drugs was measured. Doxorubicin retarded the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis in a concentration dependent manner. Cyclophosphamide and vincristine showed minimal antimicrobial activity. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by any of the drugs. An inoculum dependent effect was seen with some combinations of microbial inocula and cytotoxic drug concentrations.
TI  - Proteolytic enzymes: a new treatment strategy for prosthetic infections?
AB  - Among the different mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents that have been studied, biofilm formation is one of the most widespread. This mechanism is frequently the cause of failure in the treatment of prosthetic device infections, and several attempts have been made to develop molecules and protocols that are able to inhibit biofilm-embedded bacteria. We present data suggesting the possibility that proteolytic enzymes could significantly enhance the activities of antibiotics against biofilms. Antibiotic susceptibility tests on both planktonic and sessile cultures, studies on the dynamics of colonization of 10 biofilm-forming isolates, and then bioluminescence and scanning electron microscopy under seven different experimental conditions showed that serratiopeptidase greatly enhances the activity of ofloxacin on sessile cultures and can inhibit biofilm formation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Reduced bacterial adhesion to heparin-surface-modified intraocular lenses.
AB  - Bacterial adherence to intraocular lenses (IOLs) could be the cause of endophthalmitis following cataract surgery and lens implantation. There are previous reports that heparin bound to the surface of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOLs reduces cell adhesion. In this study, the in vitro adherence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to regular PMMA IOLs and to heparin-surface-modified (HSM) PMMA IOLs was investigated. The three bacterial strains attached in significantly lower numbers to HSM-PMMA IOLs than to PMMA IOLs (P < .01). Heparin in solution also inhibited attachment of Staphylococcus epidermidis to regular PMMA IOLs. Heparin may reduce adherence by placing a highly hydrated layer between the bacteria and the IOL surface. Therefore, the use of HSM-PMMA IOLs could diminish the incidence of endophthalmitis.
TI  - [Value of TC99m-Nanocolloid spect in diagnosis and follow-up of necrotizing external otitis].
AB  - Necrotizing external otitis (NEO), or malignant external otitis, a severe penetrating infection of the ear canal and the temporal bone, which occurs almost exclusively in diabetic or immunodepressed elderly patients, is caused in most cases by Pseudomonas aeruginosa while Staphylococcus epidermidis and Aspergillus fumigatus have been described as other possible agents. Recently bone scintigraphy, carried out above all employing SPECT, has been considered an important tool in diagnosis and follow-up of NEO. Many Authors confirm the role taken by Technetium99m-methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) and Gallium67-citrate bone scanning. Benecke suggested that response to therapy could be monitored with Ga67 or In111 scans. Two cases of NEO in which diagnosis and follow-up were made using Tc99m-nanocolloid (NC) SPECT are presented in this paper. The Authors discuss the advantages of this latter radiotracer, compared to those obtained with Ga67-citrate, in the follow-up evaluation of therapy efficacy. Tc99m-NC, in fact, is a better inflammation index in that its fixation on bone tissue is determined by the permeability of the basal membrane of vessels. Furthermore, with Tc99m-NC antibiotic therapy may be continued as long as necessary. Bone scintigraphy with other radiotracers may infact result positive for a long period after disease remission in that their fixation is linked to the one remodelling process.
TI  - Cefepime as treatment for osteomyelitis and other severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Cefepime, a novel, injectable alpha-methoxyimino aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, is active in vitro against many of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria which cause severe infections, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is more active than existing third-generation cephalosporins against multiply-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae because of its low affinity for beta-lactamases and its resistance to hydrolysis by these enzymes. Cefepime retains its high potency of activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococci other than enterococci. Seventy-four patients (46 male and 28 female) were treated with cefepime 2 g i.v. every 12 h; 61 patients were evaluable for efficacy (39 male and 22 female). The infections included pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacilli (21 patients, six with bacteraemia), septicaemia (seven), pyelonephritis (two), osteomyelitis (23, mainly caused by S. aureus), septic arthritis (four) and soft tissue infections (four, one with bacteraemia). Responses were as follows: 52 (85.3%) patients cured; three (4.9%) improved and six (9.8%) failed. The failures included three patients with osteomyelitis, one with pyelonephritis and two with pneumonia. The pathogens and eradication rates were: S. aureus 23/24 (96%), Staphylococcus epidermidis 4/4, Streptococcus spp. 10/10 (100%), P. aeruginosa 11/14 (79%), Enterobacteriaceae 28/28 (100%), Haemophilus spp. 3/3 and others 7/7. Clinical adverse effects included diarrhoea in 11 patients (14.9%) nausea in five (6.8%) and pruritus in three (4.1%). Laboratory abnormalities included leucopenia in three patients (4.1%) and direct Coombs' conversion in 32 (43.2%). Patients were treated for an average of 31.8 days for osteomyelitis and 11.9 days for other infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Infections associated with implanted blood pumps.
AB  - A variety of prosthetic blood pumps are currently undergoing experimental development or are available for clinical use. The Jarvik-7 and Jarvik 7-70 (Symbion-7 and Symbion 7-70) total artificial hearts (TAH) have been used worldwide both experimentally and for clinical mechanical circulatory support. Of the 190 patients implanted with these devices, 133 went on to cardiac transplantation and 68 of the transplanted patients are alive. Complications associated with the use of the TAH have included postoperative hemorrhage, thrombosis with thromboembolism and infection. The incidence of infection in the patients implanted with the TAH has declined-significantly since initial clinical use and is now near 30%. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most commonly pathogens isolated from these devices.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DV-7751a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - We compared the in vitro antibacterial activity of DV-7751a against gram-positive and -negative bacteria with those of quinolones currently available. MICs for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90s) against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.20, 0.39, 0.20, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. Moreover, MIC50s for DV-7751a against ofloxacin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 4-, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-fold lower than those for tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DV-7751a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Peptostreptococcus spp. at 0.39, 0.39, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively, and was 4- to > 16-fold more active against enterococci at the MIC90 level than the other quinolones tested. The activity of DV-7751a against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin at the MIC90 level and was two- to fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin. DV-7751a showed activity comparable to those of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 0.025, 0.20, and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively). DV-7751a activity was not affected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions and in human urine, as were the other quinolones tested. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the rapid bactericidal action of DV-7751a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DV-7751a was less than or equal to those of the reference drugs. DV-7751a inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at concentrations comparable to those of levofloxacin and sparfloxacin.
TI  - Plasmodium falciparum: inhibition of sporogonic development in Anopheles stephensi by gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - We investigated the effects of bacteria on Plasmodium falciparum sporogonic development in Anopheles stephensi. Four gram-negative (Escherichia coli H243, E. coli HB101, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Ewingella americana) and two gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) bacterial strains were used in the study. Tenfold dilutions of bacteria suspended in phosphate-buffered saline were mixed with an infectious meal of gametocyte-enriched cultures and fed to adult mosquitoes. All gram-negative bacteria strains partially or completely inhibited oocyst formation at different concentrations. Additionally, geometric mean number of oocysts showed a correspondingly significant decrease with increasing bacterial concentration (P < 0.001). In contrast, gram-positive bacteria strains did not have any inhibitory effects on oocyst formation even at very high concentrations. Oocyst development was not affected by: (i) culture supernatants of E. americana, (ii) formalin-treated E. coli H243, (iii) lipopolysaccharide of E. coli J5 (mutant of 0111:B4). These studies show that gram-negative but not gram-positive bacteria affect sporogonic-stage development of P. falciparum in A. stephensi. Inhibition of parasite acquisition may be an attribute of specific or nonspecific cytoadherence properties of gram-negative bacteria to the parasites.
TI  - In vitro experiments on catheter-related infections due to gram-negative rods.
AB  - Although many complications may arise with the use of central venous catheters, catheter-related bacteremia is considered to be the most serious complication. Microflora on the patient's skin (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus) is thought to represent the major source of microorganisms causing catheter-related infections. Gram-negative rods are increasingly observed as causative agents. We therefore performed an in vitro study to elucidate the pathogenesis of polymer-associated infections caused by enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters and to study the resistance of polymer surface-grown gram-negative rods against antibiotics. Using a modification of the semiquantitative method for culturing vascular cannulas on solid media described by Maki et al., we studied the adherence of various gram-negative rods to 1-cm segments of silastic catheters, a material used for Port-A-Cath-systems. Organisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae). All organisms but Klebsiella showed extensive irreversible adherence. Production of an extracellular slime substance was observed only with antimicrobially treated Pseudomonas. After 'infection', the silastic catheter segments were treated with various antimicrobial agents. The following antibiotics were used either individually or in combination: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, fosfomycin and gentamicin. Despite the fact that the antibiotic concentrations used were many times greater than the respective MICs of the various antibiotics, none of the antibiotics tested succeeded in eliminating the organisms. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible organism. These in vitro data substantiate our clinical impression that it is hardly possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters with gram-negative rods by using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of multilayer silver-copper surface films on catheter material.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of Ag, Cu, and layered Ag-Cu surface films, sputter-coated onto several types of catheter material, against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated. When 20 microL of a suspension of S. epidermidis or S. aureus (2.68 x 10(6) colony-forming units/mL) was applied onto Ag-Cu- or Cu-coated butyl rubber, bacterial numbers were greatly reduced within 10 h, and eliminated within 24 h. In contrast, antibacterial activity was significantly less on uncoated or Ag-coated surfaces. Ag-Cu- or Cu-coated silicon rubber, polyvinylchloride, and teflon were even more effective than Ag-Cu- or Cu-coated butyl rubber. Ag-Cu layered surface films also showed antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation. Multiple metal surface film combinations show great promise in lowering the incidence of device-associated nosocomial infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Controlled clinical comparison of two lysis-based blood culture systems, isolator and Septi-Chek Release, for detection of bloodstream infections.
AB  - A controlled clinical comparison was made of the Isolator (Wampole Laboratories,  Cranbury, N.J.) and the Septi-Chek Release bottle (Roche Diagnostics, Nutley, N.J.). From 6,345 blood culture sets fulfilling minimum criteria for volume of blood cultured, 840 strains were isolated, of which only 691 (82%) were considered to be representative of bloodstream infection according to Centers for Disease Control definitions. Statistically significant differences were found between the systems for the following organisms, which were all detected more frequently in the Isolator system: Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.0001), Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (P = 0.008), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P = 0.05), Salmonella spp. (P = 0.03), and Candida albicans (P = 0.02). The Septi-Chek Release system required a longer period of time than the Isolator system for detection of the following organisms:S. aureus (P = 0.0001), Enterococcus spp. (P = 0.0001), Enterobacter cloacae (P = 0.03), Escherichia coli (P = 0.0001), Klebsiella oxytoca (P = 0.03), K. pneumoniae (P = 0.02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P = 0.002), and C. albicans (P = 0.005). There were 430 episodes of bloodstream infections identified in the study; of these episodes, only those due to S. aureus were detected significantly more frequently (P = 0.0001) by the Isolator system than by the Septi-Chek Release system. However, episodes of bloodstream infections due to S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., and E. coli were detected significantly faster by the Isolator system.
TI  - Air-water interface displaces adsorbed bacteria.
AB  - Video microscopy was employed to observed the spatial distribution of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adherent to glass and polymer substrates. During rinsing procedures the bacteria remained in their original positions when the surfaces were rinsed with saline for 3 min followed by ethanol for 3 min before exposure to air. When the surfaces were rinsed with saline only, the air-liquid interface disrupted the spatial distribution of the bacteria, removing and redepositing the bacteria in clumps. A moving air-liquid interface of a gas bubble on substrate also displaced bacteria. Such artefacts produced by air-water interfaces should be avoided during bacterial adhesion experiments.
TI  - Characterization of an extracellular metalloprotease with elastase activity from  Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - The gene sepA from Staphylococcus epidermidis TU3298-P, encoding the extracellular neutral metalloprotease SepP1, was cloned into pT181mcs. DNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 1,521 nucleotides encoding a 507-amino-acid protein with an M(r) of 55,819. The sepA-containing DNA fragment did not hybridize with Staphylococcus hyicus or Staphylococcus carnosus DNA. Expression of sepA in the protease-negative S. carnosus (pT181mcsP1) resulted in overproduction of a 33-kDa protease found in the culture medium. The first 15 N-terminal amino acids of the partially purified protease completely matched the deduced DNA sequence starting at GCA (Ala-208). This finding indicated that SepP1 is synthesized as a preproenzyme with a 28-amino-acid signal peptide, a 179-amino-acid hydrophilic pro region, and a 300-amino-acid extracellular mature form with a calculated M(r) of 32,739. In activity staining, the mature protease prepared from S. carnosus (pT181mcsP1) corresponded to the extracellular S. epidermidis Tu3298-P protease. The partially purified protease had a pH optimum between 5 and 7, and its activity could be inhibited by zinc- and metal-specific inhibitors such as EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, indicating that it is a neutral metalloprotease. The protease had a low substrate specificity. Glucagon was cleaved preferentially between aromatic (Phe) and hydrophobic (Val) amino acids. The protease hydrolyzed casein and elastin. The amino acid sequence of the mature form of SepP1 revealed pronounced similarities with the thermolabile and thermostable neutral proteases of various bacilli (44 to 55% identity) and a central part of the mature form of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (31% identity). From homology comparison with the Bacillus thermoproteolyticus thermolysin, we predict that mature SepP1 binds one zinc ion at a conserved zinc-binding site.
TI  - Microbiology of cerebral abscess: a four-year study in Malaysia.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology of cerebral abscess in relation to the primary source of infections. Seventy-five patients with cerebral abscess were included in the study in the period January 1985 to December 1988. More than half of the patients studied had single lesions and the overall most common sites were in the frontal and parietal regions. Chronic suppurative otitis media, cyanotic congenital heart diseases and meningitis were among the important predisposing conditions in these patients. Approximately 25% of the patients with cerebral abscesses had no documented antecedent infections. Pure cultures were found to be predominant (66.7%) and sterile cultures were obtained from 10 (13.3%) patients. Streptococci were isolated from 23 (30.7%) patients, the commonest species being Streptococcus milleri. Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putrifaciens and Bacteroides sp were almost exclusively found in cerebral abscesses secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media; these organisms were found in mixed cultures. Streptococcus milleri, Bacteroides sp and Eikenella corrodens were found in pure cultures in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. In patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts in-situ, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids were common. Anaerobes were found in 15 (20.0%) patients, the majority in mixed cultures. Culture, as well as gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of volatile fatty acids of cerebral pus, was carried out to enhance the detection of the anaerobes. Based on these findings, an antibiotic regimen consisting of penicillin, chloramphenicol and metronidazole is recommended as an initial therapy while awaiting culture and sensitivity results.
TI  - Neutrophil functions in patients with fractures of the upper end of the femur.
AB  - In the present study, neutrophil functions were examined in vitro in 40 patients  suffering from fractures of the upper end of the femur (trochanteric and subcapital). Adherence to nylon, serum chemotaxis, and phagocytosis-bactericidal function were assayed. Three microbial strains, namely, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were used for the experiments. Adherence of the patients' neutrophils was found normal. On the contrary, the chemotactic ability of the patients' sera was inferior to that of healthy controls; phagocytosis and bactericidal function were also significantly impaired for all three bacterial strains. The results were independent of fracture site (intracapsular or extracapsular), sex, and age. The observed host defense disorders provide additional information that helps to explain the increased susceptibility of these patients to bacterial infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin and its effect on bacterial adherence to medical material].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of clarithromycin (CAM) in comparison with other 6 macrolides was determined against 419 recent clinical isolates including Streptococci, Enterococci, Staphylococci, Moraxella, Haemophilus and Bacteroides strains. MICs80's of CAM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were 0.78, 0.10 and 0.10 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs80's against Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.05 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. Laboratory-induced resistance to CAM in strains of S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in stepwise fashion and at a very low rate. Adherence to silicon filter of strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or S. epidermidis was strongly repressed by the addition of sub-MIC of CAM or other macrolides. Although tosufloxacin (TFLX) alone had no bactericidal activity against the sessile cells of P. aeruginosa strains tested, TFLX showed synergistic bactericidal activity when combined with sub-MICs of CAM or erythromycin.
TI  - Clinical bacteriology of dacryocystitis in adults.
AB  - To better define the spectrum and relative incidence of pathogens causing dacryocystitis in adults, samples of purulent lacrimal sac contents were obtained from 236 patients undergoing dacryocystorhinostomy for a clinical diagnosis of dacryocystitis. Positive culture results were obtained in 52.5%. Cultures were pure, consisting of a single organism in 71%, and were mixed in 29%. Gram-positive organisms were most common, accounting for 64.5% of the isolates. Staphylococcus epidermidis, comprising 27.3% of the isolates and Staphylococcus aureus, comprising 22.1% of the isolates, were the most frequently encountered organisms. Gram-negative organisms were present in 27.3% of the isolates with Pseudomonas aeruginosa the most common, accounting for 8.7% overall. Anaerobic organisms were found in 7.0% of the isolates with Propionibacterium acnes the most frequent, recovered in 4.7% overall. Unexpected findings included the paucity of Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms recovered and the high incidence of involvement by gram-negative and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Bacteria in Er(III) Solution by Thin-Film Magnetopheresis.
AB  - Magnetic deposition, quantitation, and identification of bacteria reacting with the paramagnetic trivalent lanthanide ion, Er, was evaluated. The magnetic deposition method was dubbed thin-film magnetopheresis. The optimization of the magnetic deposition protocol was accomplished with Escherichia coli as a model organism in 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM ErCl(3) solution. Three gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Enterococcus faecalis, and four gram-negative bacteria, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were subsequently investigated. Quantitative analysis consisted of the microscopic cell count and a scattered-light scanning of the magnetically deposited material aided by the computer data acquisition system. Qualitative analysis consisted of Gram stain differentiation and fluorescein isothiocyanate staining in combination with selected antisera against specific types of bacteria on the solid substrate. The magnetic deposition protocol allowed quantitative detection of E. coli down to the concentration of 10 CFU ml, significant in clinical diagnosis applications such as urinary tract infections. Er did not interfere with the typical appearance of the Gram-stained bacteria nor with the antigen recognition by the antibody in the immunohistological evaluations. Indirect antiserum-fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling correctly revealed the presence of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa in the magnetically deposited material obtained from the mixture of these two bacterial species. On average, the reaction of gram-positive organisms was significantly stronger to the magnetic field in the presence of Er than the reaction of gram-negative organisms. The thin-film magnetophoresis offers promise as a rapid method for quantitative and qualitative analysis of bacteria in solutions such as urine or environmental water.
TI  - [Complications of central venous catheters: prospective study].
AB  - The insertion of central venous catheters (CVC) represent a very common procedure in intensive care units. The purpose of this study was to determine the via that provide the best chance for a good location of the tip of a CVC. The 563 CVCs that were inserted percutaneously and that had a radiology control were analyzed. The infraclavicular via was used for 303 (25%) CVCs; the jugular via had 142 (25%) CVCs and the supraclavicular via was used in 118 (21%) CVCs. The rate of bad location of the tip of the CVC were 17%, 6% and 9%, respectively. There was a significant difference when the insertion through infraclavicular via and jugular via were compared. There were 9 pneumothorax (1.4%). 127 CVCs were sent to microbiology laboratory, 26 (20%) had positive culture (> 15 colony forming units). The most frequent agents isolates were: Candida spp (7), S. aureus (5), S. epidermidis (4) and P. aeruginosa (3).
TI  - [Chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol combination. In vitro study of interactions observed against potential cutaneous strains].
AB  - The interaction type of chlorhexidine digluconate/chlorocresol association (foaming solution DC 102/1, Laboratoires Pierre Fabre Medicament) have been studied according to the chess-board method, on microplate, by determining MBC (Minimal Bactericidal Concentrations) (or MFC (Minimal Fungicidal Concentrations)) adjusted to T 72-150 AFNOR norm (dilution-neutralization, contact 5 mn) and computation of FBC (or FFC) Index. Trials were carried out against 18 hospital strains (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Propionibacterium acnes, Candida albicans) and against 4 strains of the AF-NOR norm. MBC of chlorhexidine, against Staphylococci were included between 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, and between 25 and 200 micrograms/ml against the others strains. MBC of chlorocresol were included between 800 and 3,200 micrograms/ml. Against the 22 tested strains, 18 synergistic interactions (FBC Index < or = 0.75) were observed, with 4 to 8 reducing factor for chlorhexidine, and > or = 2 for chlorocresol. No antagonism was noted (maximal FBC Index = 1).
TI  - [Evaluation of a micromethod for the bactericidal activity of five disinfectants  on 108 hospital strains].
AB  - The authors studied 5 disinfectants containing aldehyde and quaternary ammonium against 108 hospital strains. The minimal bactericidal activities (MBC) were determined with a microdilution method and the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). The microdilution method results were validated using the MBCs of four reference strains tested with the dilution-neutralization method (AFNOR T 72-150). 3 disinfectants proved to be valuable. 1 disinfectant was valuable but with a MBC toward all bacteria only a dilution away from the dilution of use. 1 disinfectant was determined as unsatisfactory as 9.5 p. cent of all strains proved resistant toward it. All disinfectants matched AFNOR standards; but those specifications did not match toward hospital strains. Such an evaluation using a simple and reliable method should be of use.
TI  - Septic shock in critically ill patients: aetiology, management and outcome.
AB  - Over a period of 28 months, 45 episodes of septic shock from 83 episodes of bacteraemia were studied prospectively to evaluate their clinical profile, management and outcome. Thirty-six patients were studied, the overall incidence of septic shock being 54.2%. Gram-negative organisms accounted for 23 (51.1%) of such episodes, Gram-positive 17 (37.8%), and three episodes were polymicrobial (6.7%). The organisms isolated most frequently were Staphylococcus epidermidis (17.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3%), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp. (each 11.1%). Coagulation abnormalities were detected in 32 episodes (78%) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) occurred in 11 of these with high mortality. The most common underlying conditions were respiratory, hepatic and renal failures. The majority of these patients received crystalloids, colloids, vasopressor drugs and blood. Swan-Ganz catheters (SGC) were inserted on eight occasions, the majority of times indicating a hyperdynamic circulatory response. The overall mortality was 40%, despite aggressive management and intensive care. The most important factor in reducing mortality is early detection of bacteraemia and prompt management of these patients.
TI  - Use of disinfectants to reduce microbial contamination of hubs of vascular catheters.
AB  - The vascular catheter hub is a potential portal of entry for microorganisms that  cause catheter-related sepsis. Thus, a reduction in catheter hub contamination might reduce the incidence of catheter-related sepsis. To develop a regimen suitable for reducing microbial contamination of the catheter hub, we experimentally contaminated catheter hubs and assessed the efficacies of disinfectant solutions. Catheter hubs were incubated overnight with suspensions of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida parapsilosis. After removal of unattached microorganisms, the catheter hubs were swabbed by rotating cotton swabs dipped in 1% chlorhexidine, 1% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol, 70% ethanol, 97% ethanol, or normal saline. Posttreatment swabs of the catheter hub were obtained and cultured quantitatively. The cleaning regimens containing ethanol were the most effective. Seventy percent ethanol was more effective than chlorhexidine and is likely to be the safest treatment. We conclude that cleaning of the catheter hub with disinfectant can dramatically reduce microbial contamination.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. In murine systemic infections, FK037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA). It was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae, except Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except MRSA and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was more effective than cefpirome. These results correlated well with its in vitro activity. In murine local infections, with few exceptions, FK037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against Klebsiella pneumonia in ED50 values and against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with S. aureus and E. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. It is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of FK037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and P. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. In addition, the therapeutic effects of FK037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to MSSA, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for MSSA, 0.063 to 0.125 g for K. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for P. aeruginosa). FK037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with MSSA in neutropenic mice. These results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Successful treatment of haemodialysis catheter-related sepsis without catheter removal.
AB  - Thirty-six Permcath double-lumen catheters implanted in 36 chronic renal failure  patients for haemodialysis treatment were prospectively studied. When catheter-related sepsis was suspected a quantitative blood culture was obtained simultaneously from the catheter and from a peripheral vein. If bacterial colonies in the catheter blood specimen were fourfold greater than identical bacterial colonies in the peripheral blood specimen, the test was considered indicative of catheter sepsis and an empirical antibiotic regimen was begun while the central line remained in situ. Eleven patients suffered 13 episodes of catheter-related sepsis. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 77% of the strains isolated. All episodes were successfully treated with vancomycin or ciprofloxacin and yielded negative results on follow-up quantitative blood cultures. Fever subsided within the first 48 h of therapy and no complications occurred. None of these patients required catheter removal for cure of the catheter-related sepsis.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of Bay y 3118, a new quinolone antimicrobial was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin and three beta-lactams against 620 clinical isolates. Bay y 3118 was the most active quinolone against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus spp. The MIC90 for the members of the Enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.12 mg/L except for Serratia spp. (1 mg/L) and in general Bay y 3118 was two-fold more active than ciprofloxacin or sparfloxacin. Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.25 mg/L) than to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) or sparfloxacin (MIC90 1.0 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus was more susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) and sparfloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/L) than to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 1 mg/L) and similar differences were noted for Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was susceptible to Bay y 3118 (MIC90 0.03 mg/L) as were other streptococci. Enterococcus spp. was four-fold more susceptible to Bay y 3118 and sparfloxacin than to ciprofloxacin. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella spp. were inhibited by Bay y 3118 < or = 0.015 mg/L. Anaerobes were more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to other quinolones; the MIC90 of Bay y 3118 for Bacteroides fragilis being 0.06 mg/L. Little effect was seen by increasing the inoculum from 10(4) cfu to 10(6). Bay y 3118 inhibited Chlamydia sp. at concentrations < or = 0.015 mg/L.
TI  - [Antibiotic prophylaxis in cardiovascular surgery: comparison of sulbactam-ampicillin and cefuroxime].
AB  - A total of 200 patients (131 males and 69 females), scheduled for cardiovascular  surgery were randomly assigned to receive either sulbactam/ampicillin 1 g IV of cefuroxime 2 g IV before the surgical incision and then, postoperatively, 8-hourly x 3 days. There were five failure of prophylaxis (all in the cefuroxime group): 3 sternal incision abscesses (1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis), one urinary tract infection (Staphylococcus aureus) and one Micrococcus pneumoniae. Tolerance to both antibiotics was excellent. In our sample of patients, the efficacy and safety of sulbactam/ampicillin were not different from those of cefuroxime in prophylaxis in cardiovascular surgery.
TI  - Adherence of Serratia marcescens, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis to blood transfusion bags (CPD-SAGMAN sets).
AB  - The adherence of 4 isolates of Serratia marcescens, 1 isolate of Serratia liquefaciens, 1 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 2 of Staphylococcus epidermidis to blood transfusion sets (CPD-SAGMAN) consisting of bags and connecting tubing was tested. All strains adhered well to the connecting tubes (polyvinyl chloride) from the transfusion sets from 3 manufacturers. Three isolates from a Swedish outbreak of septicaemia associated with contaminated blood bags showed greater adherence than an isolate from a urinary tract infection. There was no significant adherence of S. marcescens to the blood bags. In general, there were no significant differences in the adherence of a given isolate to the plastics from different manufacturers. Appropriate hygienic procedures for the production of transfusion sets appear to be of greater importance than differences in the plastic material as regards the incidence of transfusion-related bacteremia.
TI  - Clinical studies of oral quinolone once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory tract infections were studied. The most common species recovered from the sputum specimens of these patients were Haemophilus influenzae, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Gram positive cocci unidentified, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Morexella catarrhalis, Streptococcus epidermidis, and another Haemophilus species in this order. All these bacteria were susceptible to ofloxacin except for one strain of methicillin resistant S. aureus. A satisfactory clinical outcome was achieved in 34 of 40 patients (85%). It is concluded that ofloxacin, 400 mg once daily, is useful for patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin vs. ciprofloxacin in complicated urinary tract infection.
AB  - This prospective, open, randomized clinical study compared the efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in adult patients with complicated urinary tract infection, defined as infection in the presence of an underlying anatomic or functional abnormality of the urinary tract. Seventy-two patients were randomized, 37 received norfloxacin (400 mg orally twice daily for 10-21 days) and 35 received ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally every 12 hours for 14-21 days). Patients were clinically assessed, and urine cultures were obtained following two to four days of therapy, and five to nine days and four to six weeks after discontinuation of therapy. Seventy-two percent of the norfloxacin group and 79 percent of the ciprofloxacin group were considered cured. This difference was not significant. One failure of norfloxacin therapy was associated with the emergence of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Following norfloxacin therapy, in 2 patients superinfections developed with resistant organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis [1] and Pseudomonas maltophilia [1]). Twelve patients, 6 in each group, experienced adverse reactions, which were considered related to the study drug therapy in only four instances. Our results indicated comparable efficacy and tolerability of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection in adults.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of paper money].
AB  - Bacteriological survey of one hundred twenty currency notes was done. Aerobic spore-forming bacilli (91%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (63.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.2%), Enterococcus (24.1%), alpha-hem. streptococcus (4.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.7%), Corynebacterium (7.5%), Lactobacilli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Enterobacter (19.2%), E. coli (17.5%), Proteus (1.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%), Shigella flexneri (0.8%) were isolated from paper money samples. Currency notes in general were bacteriologically contaminated especially with enteric pathogens and potentially pathogens, it was thought that some measures have to be taken to reduce these ill effects.
TI  - In vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of T-3761, a new fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent which  has an oxazine ring structure with a cyclopropyl moiety at C-10, was compared with those of other agents against 2,854 clinical isolates. T-3761 had a broad spectrum of activity and had potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Clostridium spp. tested were 0.39 to 6.25 micrograms/ml. Its activity was comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and four- to eightfold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, but its activity was two- to eightfold less than that of tosufloxacin. Some isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus (MIC of ciprofloxacin, greater than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml) were still susceptible to T-3761 (MIC of T-3761, less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml). The MICs of T-3761 against 90% of the streptococci and enterococci tested were 3.13 to 100 micrograms/ml. Its activity was equal to or 2- or 4-fold greater than those of norfloxacin and fleroxacin, equal to or 2- or 4-fold less than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, and 4- to 16-fold less than that of tosufloxacin. The activity of T-3761 against gram-negative bacteria was usually fourfold greater than those of norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin. Many isolates which were resistant to nonfluoroquinolone agents, such as minocycline- or imipenem-resistant S. aureus, ceftazidime-resistant members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, gentamicin- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, were susceptible to T-3761. The MBCs of T-3761 were either equal to or twofold greater than the MICs. The number of viable cells decreased rapidly during incubation with T-3761 at one to four times the MIC. At a concentration of four times the MIC, the frequencies of appearance of spontaneous mutants resistant to T-3761 against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa were 2.2 x 10(-8) to less than or equal to 1.2 x 10(-9). The 50% inhibitory concentrations of T-3761 for DNA gyrases isolated from E. coli and P. aeruginosa were 0.88 and 1.9 micrograms/ml, respectively.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - MHC-unrestricted recognition of bacteria-infected target cells by human CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.
AB  - A CD8+ alpha beta TCR+ T cell clone (A35) was isolated from the synovial fluid of a patient with post-enteric reactive arthritis caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. This clone efficiently killed autologous and allogeneic target cells that had been preincubated with live but not with heat-killed bacteria. There was no restriction by polymorphic parts of HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules and a HLA class II-deficient mutant cell line was lysed as efficiently as its normal counterpart, whereas infected HLA class I-deficient cells (Daudi cells) were not. The clone showed crossreaction between Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes, but did not lyse target cells preincubated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. MAb to CD2, CD3, and CD8 efficiently blocked A35, whereas the addition of mAb to HLA class II or to HLA class I did not. This clone apparently represents a novel effector mechanism against bacteria-infected or -modified cells that could be involved in the immunopathology of reactive arthritis.
TI  - A novel electrical method for the prevention of microbial colonization of intravascular cannulae.
AB  - An electrical device designed to prevent microbial attachment to plastic intravascular cannulae is described. The device produced an electrical current (10 microA) in both carbon-impregnated and 'Hydrocath' cannulae. In-vitro models were utilized to demonstrate that the current can block several mechanisms by which microorganisms gain initial access to intravascular devices, including extra- and intra-luminal routes. The electrical system prevented organisms from traversing along both the external and internal surfaces of the cannulae. Effective prevention of cannula colonization was demonstrated subsequent to challenge with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The findings suggest that the electrical device may offer in-vivo cannula protection from microbial attachment and colonization, thereby reducing the potential for infection.
TI  - [Resistant rate to antibiotics in Tian Tan Hospital for 3 years].
AB  - The resistance to antibiotics of the 985 clinical isolates collected in Tian Tan  hospital was studied. The results showed that S. aureus had a resistant rate of more than 90% to penicillin and was also highly resistant to erythromycin. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) was isolated in 15.6% of all the isolates with S. aureus. The isolation rate of MRSA is lower than that in other countries or districts of West Pacific Area. K. pneumonia and other Gram negative bacilli had a resistant rate of 0.6% to amikacin and P. aeruginosa was all sensitive to Polymyxin-B.
TI  - Changing patterns of blood culture isolates from patients with acute leukemia: a  review of twenty years' experience.
AB  - During the 20-year period, 1972-1991, 286 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 200  (45%) of 445 patients with acute leukemia in a hematology ward, giving an incidence of 482 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. The frequency of bacteremia was almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of all the isolates for the first half of the study period to 50% for the latter half. Despite the common use of ceftazidime and imipenem during the last 5-year period, Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in frequency to be the most frequent organism. This was opposite to the decreased frequencies of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The isolates of P. aeruginosa obtained during this period, all of which proved sensitive to ceftazidime and/or imipenem, were almost equally distributed among five serogroups, although a temporal preponderance of a limited number of serogroups was observed during the preceding 15-year period. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9% in the first decade to 35% in the latter decade. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species and, to a lesser extent, Staphylococcus aureus were ranked as major pathogens. Among the recent isolates of S. aureus, methicillin-resistant strains virtually replaced methicillin-sensitive ones. Therefore, until more effective means for control of P. aeruginosa bacteremia in particular become available, the occurrence of this infection will continue to limit the successful treatment of acute leukemia.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of Q-35, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Q-35, an 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, lomefloxacin, and sparfloxacin. The MICs of Q-35 for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were 0.2, 6.25, 0.2, 0.39, and 0.39 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of Q-35 was 4- to 16-fold greater than those of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin but equal to those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against these organisms. For 82 ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci (MIC90 = 100 micrograms/ml), Q-35 was the most active of the new quinolones tested (MIC90 = 6.25 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s of Q-35 against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.2, 0.78, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, and Q-35 was 2- to 16-fold less active than the other quinolones tested. Q-35 showed potent bactericidal activity and inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of SCE-2787, a new parenteral cephalosporin with  a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - SCE-2787, a new cephalosporin having a condensed azolium moiety in the 3 position and an aminothiadiazolyl group in the 7 beta side chain, was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo activities in comparison with those of ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefpirome, and E1040. Against methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, SCE-2787 was more active than ceftazidime and E1040 and was as active as flomoxef and cefpirome, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) being 1.56 micrograms/ml or less. SCE-2787 was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which the MIC90 was 6.25 micrograms/ml, which was lower than that of cefpirome and comparable to that of ceftazidime. SCE-2787 was marginally active against methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci and Enterococcus faecalis, although its MIC90s were the lowest among those of the antibiotics tested. The activities of SCE-2787 against Streptococcus species, most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded those of ceftazidime and flomoxef and were comparable to those of cefpirome. Furthermore, MIC90s of SCE-2787 were significantly lower than those of ceftazidime for ceftazidime-resistant isolates of Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae. SCE-2787 was resistant to hydrolysis by various types of beta-lactamases, including the Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, and had low affinities for these enzymes, with Km or Ki values of greater than 100 microM. The in vitro activity of SCE-2787 was reflected in its efficacy in mouse protection tests. Thus, SCE-2787 appears to be a promising cephalosporin that should be further evaluated in clinical trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6859, a new potent fluoroquinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - DU-6859, (-)-7-[(7S)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1R,2R)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. The MICs for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (MIC90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. MIC50s of DU-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. DU-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. Although the activity of DU-6859 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the MIC50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the MIC90 level. DU-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. Strains of Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to DU-6859; MIC90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. DU-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. The action of DU-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the MICs. DU-6859 activity was not affected by different media, pH, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.
TI  - In vitro activity of OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro activity of OPC-17116, a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, was compared with the activities of other fluoroquinolones. OPC-17116 inhibited 50% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested and 90% of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. At less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae were inhibited, which was comparable to or better than the activities of fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin but less than the activity of ciprofloxacin. OPC-17116 inhibited 90% of the staphylococci tested at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it did not inhibit methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Group A, B, C, F, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml, being four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Tosufloxacin was the most active agent tested against gram-positive cocci. OPC-17116 inhibited Bacteroides fragilis at 4 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal effect of inoculum size on MIC, and the MBCs were within 1 dilution of the MICs. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased at pH 6 and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations, but it was unaffected by human serum. OPC-17116 showed a postantibiotic effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus similar to the postantibiotic effects reported for other fluoroquinolones. The frequency of spontaneous single-step resistance was low (less than 10(-9)), but repeated passage of organisms in the presence of OPC-17116 resulted in the selection of resistant isolates.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to evaluate efficacy of amikacin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of amikacin (AMK) against 269 strains of various clinical isolates obtained in 1989 were determined and the reliability of the AMK disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. In addition, clinical significance of various systems for the interpretation of the disc tests was evaluated to determine more useful method in the evaluation of clinical efficacy of AMK. Included in the study were a 3 category system of NCCLS, a 4 category system used in Japan, and the system proposed by the British Society for Antimicrobial chemotherapy. In this study, MICs were determined using the Mueller-Hinton agar containing 50 mg/L of Ca and 25 mg/L of Mg at an inoculum level of 10(3-4) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of AMK against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 6.25 and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Those against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobactor aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. were less than 3.13 micrograms/ml. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens were both less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml. The disc susceptibility test was carried out according to the instruction in the Showa disc manual. Inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MIC values. The results of AMK disc susceptibility test obtained either with 30 micrograms discs or 10 micrograms discs were well correlated with MICs, indicating that the disc method was reliable in estimating approximate values of MICs (r = -0.807 to -0.897, P less than 0.01 in both instances). In the 4 category classification system currently used in Japan, the break points in MIC values of AMK proposed are (+3) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (+2) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, and (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with Showa 30 micrograms discs and 30 micrograms discs prepared in this laboratory showed false positive results in 13% and 10.8% of the samples, and false negative results in 1.5% and 3.3%, respectively. In the 3 category classification system of NCCLS, the MIC break points proposed are defined sensitive (S) for MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml and resistant (R) for MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. In this study, the 30 micrograms disc tests using the above-mentioned 2 different types of discs resulted in false positive responses in 6.3% and 5.2% of the samples tested and false negative results in 1.1% and 1.9% of the samples, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo effect of antibiotics on catheters colonized by staphylococci.
AB  - An in vitro model was used to study whether and how catheter infections can be cured. Silastic catheters were "infected" with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Staphylococcus epidermidis KH11 and V2; these "infections" were then treated with 24, 48 and 96 h continuous infusions of various antimicrobial agents administered both as monotherapy and in combination. The Staphylococcus aureus strain was considerably more difficult to eliminate from catheters than were the Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. This experience gained in the laboratory was then applied in vivo to 16 episodes of catheter sepsis in seven children. Treatment for at least six days with imipenem/cilastatin combined with fosfomycin or an aminoglycoside successfully eliminated the pathogens isolated from 11 of the 16 episodes of infection. The broad-spectrum combination was chosen because it could not be assumed that individual pathogens would be sensitive to a single substance. Nine of the infected catheters could be retained in the patients. This experience suggests that it may be possible to successfully eliminate the colonization of central venous catheters by coagulase-negative staphylococci using the antimicrobial agents employed here.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative wound infection: a prospective study of 1770 wounds.
AB  - A prospective study of postoperative wound infection was carried out over a 12-month period. Intra-operative swabs from the patients' anterior nares, the opened viscus and parietes were cultured using standard bacteriological techniques. Of the 1770 wounds studied, 167 (9.4%) became infected. Wound infection rates, according to clinical wound types, were clean 5.9%, clean-contaminated 10.7%, contaminated 24.3% and dirty 52.9%. The figures according to microbiological wound types were clean 4.7%, and potentially, lightly and heavily contaminated 15.3%, 22.1% and 30.2% respectively. The commonest causative organisms were Staphylococcus aureus 23.7%, Escherichia coli 16.9%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.5% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 13.0%. When isolated intra-operatively, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa appeared to have a high probability of causing postoperative wound infection, but the intra-operative isolation of Bacteroides sp. was a poor predictor of subsequent wound infection.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. Ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and all Aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and Haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. The MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. All group A and B streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. All methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of Ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the MIC90 for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; MIC90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. Ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. Of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; D-sphingosine; D,L-sphinganine; 4-D-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; N,N-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against Staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microM]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microM]). The sphingosines were similarly active against Streptococcus pyogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Propionibacterium acnes, Brevibacterium epidermidis, and Candida albicans, moderately active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens. Both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. Optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees C and at pH 6.5. Antimicrobial activity, which was Ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. Because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Amikacin, ceftazidime, and flucloxacillin against suspended and adherent Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis in an in vitro model of infection.
AB  - Bacterial inocula were exposed as suspended cultures or as adherent biofilms on glass beads in a novel in vitro model of infection to oscillating drug concentrations mimicking human serum kinetics during clinical treatment. Amikacin was given once or thrice daily alone or in combination with ceftazidime or flucloxacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Killing of adherent bacteria was significantly reduced during single-drug treatment compared with suspended bacteria (P less than .001), and beta-lactams were more active than amikacin against both suspended and adherent bacteria (P less than .01). Amikacin-beta-lactam combinations killed the inocula more rapidly and were consistently bactericidal against both suspended and adherent pathogens (P less than .05). Once-daily dosing of amikacin produced greater initial killing than thrice daily dosing (P less than .05), but both regimens were similarly effective after 48 h. The differences in antibiotic activity against suspended and adherent bacteria may relate to clinical failures in the treatment of foreign-body infections by bacteria sensitive to the administered antibiotics, as determined by standard susceptibility tests.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The HID50 (hypothermia-inducing dose 50): an alternative to the LD50 for measurement of bacterial virulence.
AB  - A group of 40 mice involved in bacterial LD50 estimations was monitored over a period of 4 days by two teams of observers. One team measured the colonic temperature of the mice, the other assessed them clinically and killed those they judged terminally ill. The temperatures of all mice considered terminally ill dropped before this judgement was made. Measurement of such infection-induced hypothermia provides a more objective, reproducible, and earlier endpoint than that used in conventional LD50 estimation.
TI  - Necrotizing 'malignant' external otitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Necrotizing "malignant" external otitis is a life-threatening skull base infection that originates in the external auditory canal and is characterized by otalgia and purulent aural discharge with external auditory canal cellulitis and granulation. Necrotizing external otitis, seen almost exclusively in elderly diabetics, is almost always caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To our knowledge, there have been only six nonpseudomonal cases reported to date. We describe a 70-year-old diabetic man with necrotizing external otitis caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, confirmed by serial cultures. This case was characterized by otalgia, purulent otorrhea, preauricular swelling, bony external auditory canal erosion, and a conductive hearing loss. Despite prolonged intravenous antistaphylococcal antibiotic therapy and frequent local debridement, the patient's symptoms never completely resolved. As demonstrated by the treatment failure, S epidermidis necrotizing external otitis, may represent a more refractory form of this already virulent disease process. We believe this to be the first reported case of necrotizing external malignant otitis caused by S epidermidis.
TI  - Infections in acute myeloid leukemia. Study of 184 febrile episodes.
AB  - We analysed the case records of 75 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia treated  at our institute from January 1984 to December 1988 to see the pattern and severity of infections and their relationship with granulocytopenia. A total of 184 febrile episodes (mean 2.45) were recorded; 153 (83.15%) were associated with granulocytopenia while 31 (16.84%) were without granulocytopenia. Among granulocytopenic patients, infections could be documented microbiologically in 58.2% and clinically in 30.0% of episodes. In the remaining 41.8% of episodes, no clinical, radiological or microbiological evidence could be found out. The various sites of infection were: septicaemia 21 (13.72%), disseminated fungal infections 4 (2.6%), upper respiratory tract 21 (13.7%), chest 58 (37.9%), gastrointestinal tract 8 (5.2%), genitourinary (7.2%), soft tissues 5 (3.2%) and skin cellulitis 7 (4.6%). Microbiologically, gram negative organisms (Klebsiella pneumoniae, E coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were most common, followed by gram positive (Streptococcal faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph albus, Staph epidermidis). Four patients had disseminated fungal infection: candida 2, aspergillus *1, mucormycosis *1. Among non neutropenic febrile episodes, the sites infected were: septicemia 2 (6.4%), chest 9(29.0%), upper respiratory tract 1 (3.2%), gastrointestinal 1 (3.2%), soft tissue 1 (3.2%), drug fever 3 (9.6%) and fever of unknown origin 14 (45.2%).
TI  - Comparative efficacy of contact lens disinfection solutions.
AB  - Using the D value method of analysis, we evaluated the relative antimicrobial effectiveness of eight contact lens disinfection solutions against a standard population of challenge organisms as defined in the Microbiological Guidelines proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Six bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens) and two fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) were investigated. The disinfectants included hydrogen peroxide (AOSept, MiraSept, Oxysept), chlorine-based solutions (Aerotab and Softab), soaking solutions containing synthetic, high molecular weight preservatives (ReNu and Opti-Free) and a thimerosal preserved soaking solution (Hydrocare Cleaning and Soaking Solution). The one-step hydrogen peroxide system (AOSept) was evaluated both with and without the catalytic disk. To facilitate comparison of the disinfecting solutions, we defined a new measure of performance, namely "power" of solution. This has an advantage over the "safety factor" because the solution power is independent of the size of the initial inoculum. Because different approaches to analysis may yield a wide range of D values for one set of survival data we call for adoption of a standardized approach. Our results suggest that one of the chlorine-based solutions fails to meet the FDA recommendations for bacterial challenge. Most solutions performed poorly against mycotic challenge. However, when used over longer disinfecting periods, 3% hydrogen peroxide and the Hydrocare solution gave adequate performance against fungi.
TI  - Quantitative separation of bacteria in saline solution using lanthanide Er(III) and a magnetic field.
AB  - A trivalent lanthanide ion, erbium (Er3+), has been used in combination with a magnetic separation technique to isolate seven bacterial species from suspensions in 0.9% saline. Erbium has an exceptionally high atomic magnetic moment of 9.3 Bohr magnetons, and following addition as ErCl3 (final concentration 5 mM) to bacterial suspensions, it imparts the magnetic moment to the bacterial cells by ionic binding to the cell surface. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were obtained from the Quality Control Depository of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA as suspensions in 0.9% NaCl, in concentrations ranging from 10(2) to 10(8) c.f.u. ml-1. Bacteria were separated from solution inside a capillary flow cell exposed to a highly non-homogeneous magnetic field (maximum field intensity was 0.4 T) and quantified by a light scattering method. The quantity of cellular deposition in the magnetic field was correlated with the initial concentration of cells in the suspension, expressed in c.f.u. ml-1, and sample volume (1.5 and 3.0 ml), sample pH (prior to ErCl3 addition), affinity to Gram stain (negative vs positive) and species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Superficial punctate keratopathy and bacterial growth in patients with unilateral aphakia using extended-wear soft contact lenses.
AB  - We prospectively examined corneal conditions and bacterial growth in 77 individuals with unilateral aphakia who were using extended-wear soft contact lenses. The ratios of positive bacterial growth (70.6-79.4%) from 34 patients with superficial punctate keratopathy were significantly higher than those (41.9-46.5%) from the 43 subjects with normal corneas. Bacterial growth was found frequently in patients with superficial punctate keratopathy who were older than 80 years and in those using soft contact lenses for more than 22 days. Several kinds of bacteria grew from the specimens. Among the most common were Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew from patients with superficial punctate keratopathy who were using extended-wear soft contact lenses.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on Staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), Salmonella typhimurium (Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re of LPS mutants) and Escherichia coli.
AB  - Rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus (209P, Cowan I, Smith diffuse and Smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and K) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Chedid, 277, and 8N3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. Escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Salmonella typhimurium LT2, such as Ra, Rc, Rd, and Re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. Lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against M. lysodeikticus and B. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against S. typhimurium and S. aureus. With regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, NP1, NP4, and NP5, NP1 showed strong bactericidal activity against K. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. Neither NP4 nor NP5 showed any bactericidal activity, while NP5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of NP1 against K. pneumoniae 277.
TI  - Surface-immobilized polyethylene oxide for bacterial repellence.
AB  - Polyethylene terephthalate films were surface-modified with polyethylene oxide (18,500 g/mol) using a solution technique described previously. These films were investigated for their resistance to bacterial adhesion. Three bacterial strains most commonly associated with implant infections, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were cultured in tryptic soya broth, human plasma and human serum on the polymeric substrates. Significant reductions (between 70 and 95%) in adherent bacteria were observed on the polyethylene oxide-modified substrates compared to the untreated control polyethylene terephthalate. Surface modification with polyethylene oxide may reduce the risk of implant-associated infections. Plasma fibrinogen was observed to play an important role in the adhesion of all three of these species on both the polyethylene oxide-modified and control polyethylene terephthalate materials.
TI  - [Comparative in vitro susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to pefloxacin and 14 antibiotics].
AB  - In vitro activity of pefloxacin against 782 bacterial strains isolated from hospitalized patients (July-September 1991) in Wroclaw was compared with that of 14 antibiotics (4 aminoglycosides and 10 beta-lactamase). The most susceptible to pefloxacin were: Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.0%), Klebsiella (94.4%), Proteus mirabilis (93.8%) and Escherichia coli (92.7%). The least susceptible proved to be: nonfermentative Gram-negative rods (46.5%), and among them Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3% weakly sensitive, 0% sensitive strains). It was found that over 80% of Gram-negative rods were susceptible to pefloxacin, amikacin, netilmicin, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The most active against staphylococci were netilmicin (92.6%), pefloxacin (89.4%) and amikacin (82.5%).
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Exit-site and tunnel infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - One hundred two exit-site infections (ESI) were diagnosed in 63 of 163 (38.6%) patients, with an incidence of one episode every 23.7 patient-months in patients with a history of ESI, whereas in the overall continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population the incidence was one episode every 48.7 patient-months. In diminishing order of frequency, the bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The probability of remaining free of ESI was 72% at 1 year and 45% at 5 years. The ESI that led to catheter removal were due to S aureus and gram-negative rods. In 13 (48%) of 27 S aureus ESI unresponsive to antibiotics and local care, deroofing and outer cuff shaving completely resolved the ESI. Despite this treatment, the catheters of the remaining 14 patients had to be removed because of peritonitis associated with the tunnel infection. In conclusion, ESI is a major cause of CAPD failure. In our series, shaving the cuff as a rescue treatment was effective for almost 50% of the patients with antibiotic-resistant S aureus ESI.
TI  - [Bacteriological studies on pharyngeal and tracheal colonization in patients of operations and patients in ICU].
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the pharynx before and one week after operation, and contamination of the trachea during intubation in 7 patients who underwent operations were investigated. And bacterial colonization of pharynx, tracheas, and mechanical-ventilators in 7 ICU patients was investigated. Flora of palms of 10 ICU personnel was also examined: 1) Oral bacteria began to be found in the trachea several hours after intubation. 2) In oropharyngeal flora, one week after operation, Neisseria and anaerobes which belong to normal flora decreased because of antibiotics, but no new resistant bacteria appeared. 3) Although isolates from pharynx of preoperative patients were normal flora, those of ICU patients were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus spp., gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeast liked organisms etc, which were resistant to antibiotics. 4) From the trachea of intubated patients in ICU, oral bacteria were isolated. 5) Pseudomonas pickettii was isolated from the expiratory side of ventilator circuits in one patient, but it was not isolated from the patient. 6) From hands of ICU personnel, gram-positive bacteria such as coagulase negative staphylococci, Coryne bacterium spp. and Bacillus spp. were isolated. 7) One patient in ICU, who developed pneumonia due to resistant Bacteroides fragilis following oropharyngeal colonization, was reported. These studies suggested the importance of environmental control, careful selection of antibiotics, and attention to change of flora.
TI  - Ofloxacin versus cephalexin in the treatment of skin, skin structure, and soft-tissue infections in adults.
AB  - A multicenter study was conducted to compare the safety and efficacy of oral ofloxacin with that of cephalexin in microbiologic eradication of skin and skin-structure pathogens and the clinical treatment of skin and skin-structure infections. The subjects, 335 adult patients with acute localized infections of the skin, skin structure, or soft tissue, were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of ofloxacin orally every 12 hours or 500 mg of cephalexin orally every six hours for 10 days. At admission, 398 aerobic pathogens were isolated, the most common being Staphylococcus aureus (160 isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes (49), coagulase-negative staphylococci (30), Staphylococcus epidermidis (25), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10). Of 317 isolates tested against ofloxacin, 96% were susceptible, and of 325 tested against cephalexin, 85% were susceptible (P less than 0.001). Microbiologic and clinical outcome were evaluated in 73 ofloxacin-treated patients and in 65 cephalexin-treated patients. The causative pathogens were eradicated in 95% of the ofloxacin group and in 92% of the cephalexin group. In the ofloxacin group, 75% were clinically cured and 23% improved, and in the cephalexin group, 74% and 23%, respectively. Drug-related adverse experiences were reported by 14% of the 161 ofloxacin-treated patients and by 11% of the 162 cephalexin-treated patients; gastrointestinal disturbances were reported by 8% and 7% and nervous system effects by 6% and 1%, respectively (P less than 0.05). It is concluded that both ofloxacin and cephalexin are safe and effective in the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections.
TI  - Cultured epithelial autografts: three years of clinical experience with eighteen  patients.
AB  - Eighteen patients with major burns (mean total body surface area burned was 49% and mean total body surface area with full-thickness burns was 38%) had cultured epithelial autografts applied to 2% to 35% of the body surface area. In six patients successful "take" of greater than 65% occurred, and in 12 patients less than 40% "take" occurred. Most wounds underwent early excision to subcutaneous fat or fascia, and the wounds of 16 patients had been treated previously with homograft. Cultured epithelial autografts were covered with either single or multilayered dressings. Perioperative wound cultures showed that all patients had microorganisms, and appropriate perioperative antibiotic coverage of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was noted less frequently in the poor take group, which may have influenced subsequent cultured epithelial allograft take. Adherence and stability of cultured epithelial allografts lag behind adherence and stability of meshed split-thickness autograft. The anterior trunk and thighs are the best recipient sites. The number of autograft harvests that were required to close wounds and the length of hospital stay were not significantly decreased by the use of cultured epithelial allografts as compared with comparable full-thickness burns that were treated previously without cultured epithelial allografts. Presently, grafting with cultured epithelial allografts is an adjunct but not an alternative to conventional burn-wound coverage with split-thickness autograft, because engraftment is inconsistent.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - White cells protect donor blood against bacterial contamination.
AB  - The possible beneficial role of white cells (WBCs) in donor blood has been investigated with respect to their capacity to remove bacteria. Preparations of buffy coat and whole blood, containing as well as reduced of WBCs, were inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Propionibacterium species. Upon storage at room temperature, the presence of WBCs resulted in a reduction of the bacterial content. Units inoculated with S. epidermidis and E. coli were completely cleared of bacteria within 5 to 24 hours. On the other hand, S. aureus, after an initial reduction in number, started to multiply. In WBC-reduced units, the initial bacterial content remained unchanged for 5 hours, but the bacteria then exhibited vigorous growth within 48 hours in buffy coat and slower growth in whole blood. Propionibacterium sp. did not grow with or without WBCs. P. aeruginosa did not grow in buffy coat but showed a growth pattern similar to that of S. aureus in whole blood. The presence of WBCs in the donor blood during the first hours after collection thus seems to rid the blood of at least some species of bacteria. These results indicate that it would be favorable not to perform WBC reduction during blood collection and that several hours of contact can be needed to obtain sterility.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Comparative efficacies of soft contact lens disinfectant solutions against microbial films in lens cases.
AB  - Biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Candida albicans, established in the wells of a polyethylene contact lens case, retained viability to certain soft contact lens disinfectant solutions after exposure for the manufacturer's minimum recommended disinfection times. The relative order of resistance of bacterial biofilms was as follows: S marcescens was greater than P aeruginosa, which was greater than S epidermidis, which was greater than S pyogenes. Air drying of biofilms for 10 hours increased the efficacy of the disinfectant solutions, but drying was not enough to decrease the incidence of recovery to 0% for all solutions. Hydrogen peroxide was more effective against biofilms than disinfectant solutions formulated with chlorhexidine gluconate or polyquaternium-1 or polyaminopropyl biguanide. We recommend that determination of efficacy of contact lens disinfectant solutions should include challenges against biofilms.
TI  - Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same.
TI  - Treatment of posttraumatic osteitis with intravenous ofloxacin.
AB  - The subjects were 25 patients with osteomyelitis (n = 17) or other bone or joint  infections, scheduled for surgical procedures, including debridement, sequestrectomy, and bone resection and reconstruction. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 22 patients, Staphylococcus epidermidis in one, Streptococcus haemolyticus in one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in one, and a Pasteurella species in one. During surgery and for a mean of four days after surgery, each patient received 200 mg of ofloxacin intravenously twice daily (one patient received 300 mg and another received 400 mg twice daily). The patients were then given 200 mg of ofloxacin orally twice daily until the wound was healed (after a mean of 18 days). The wound was healed in all patients and no cases of reinfection occurred. It is concluded that intravenous ofloxacin given perioperatively may be more effective than oral ofloxacin in the management of osteomyelitis.
TI  - Bacteremia in granulocytopenic patients in a tertiary-care general hospital.
AB  - Episodes of bacteremia in granulocytopenic patients during 1985 and 1986 at a tertiary-care general hospital were reviewed to assess the adequacy of current empiric antimicrobial therapy. The major pathogens in these cases were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae organisms, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. This combination of pathogens differed from that found at the same facility from 1975 to 1977, when Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci predominated. When apparent, the sources of infection were predominantly venous catheters, the lower respiratory tract, and the urinary tract; most frequently there was no identifiable focus. S. epidermidis and streptococci were isolated more frequently during initial episodes of febrile bacteremia, and P. aeruginosa was isolated more often during subsequent episodes. If a narrow definition for therapeutic outcome is used, only 38% of episodes had a favorable response; response rates were no different with appropriate or inappropriate therapy. The low response rate may have been related to the use of data from the previous review to guide empiric therapy and to the subsequent inadequate treatment of infections caused by Pseudomonas and Enterobacter organisms. The overall mortality per total bacteremic episodes was 19%, and the primary factor associated with mortality was pneumonia (P less than .0001). This study emphasizes the need for ongoing surveillance of local patterns of bacteremia to direct empiric therapy.
TI  - Disinfecting activities of non-peroxide soft contact lens cold disinfection solutions.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of three non-peroxide soft contact lens chemical disinfection systems--ReNu Multi-Purpose Solution (0.00005% polyaminopropyl biguanide), Opti-Soft Disinfecting Solution (0.001% polyquaternium-1), and Opti-Free Rinsing, Disinfecting & Storage Solution (0.001% polyquaternium-1)--were compared to Soft Mate Disinfecting Solution (0.005% chlorhexidine digluconate). Each product was separately inoculated with each of five microorganisms at approximately 10(6) microorganisms per mL. All of the solutions demonstrated excellent disinfecting activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with complete disinfection occurring within 4 hours. Only Soft Mate disinfected Serratia marcescens within 4 hours. ReNu reduced the microorganisms to 10-100 cells/mL and Opti-Soft and Opti-Free reduced the number to 10(2)-10(3) cells/mL. For the fungal species, Soft Mate showed excellent activity against Candida albicans (disinfection in 4 hours) and reduced Aspergillus fumigatus to 10(3) spores/mL in 4 hours. After 4 hours ReNu, Opti-Soft, and Opti-Free had reduced C. albicans only slightly, to 10(5) cells/mL and displayed virtually no disinfecting activity against A. fumigatus. For these newer chemical disinfection systems, diligent cleaning and rinsing of the soft contact lenses are the most important steps in the patient care regimen.
TI  - An analysis of ten-year trends in infections in adults on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
AB  - Infectious complications are the Achilles heel of CAPD. To determine trends in these events, we analyzed the CAPD related infections of 303 adults on CAPD at a single university center between 1979 and 1989. During this decade the percentage of insulin-dependent diabetics increased from 14% to 39% (p less than 0.005). Peritonitis rates fell from 2.4 episodes/y in 1979 to 0.8 episodes/y in 1989. The proportion of patients with multiple episodes of peritonitis decreased (40% of the patients in 1979-1982 vs 15% in 1983-1989, p = 0.0001) while the proportion of patients with no episodes of peritonitis increased during the same periods (29% vs 49%, p = 0.005). The proportion of peritonitis episodes due to S. aureus rose over the 10-year period (p = 0.005), while those due to S. epidermidis decreased (p less than 0.10). The overall incidence of S. aureus peritonitis remained unchanged. Catheter infection rates initially increased and then fell during the decade; S. aureus remained the predominant cause. The proportion of peritonitis episodes associated with catheter infection rose (13% in 1982 vs 24% in 1989, p = 0.025), and in 1989, 80% of these episodes were caused by S. aureus. Catheter loss was also primarily due to S. aureus infections in 1989 (80%). Infections due to P. aeruginosa were a persistent problem. The proportion of patients transferring to hemodialysis each year paralleled catheter loss rates, which in turn appeared to be more related to catheter infection rates than to peritonitis rates. We conclude that control of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa will be the key to future reductions in the infectious complications of CAPD patients.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of wounds in seriously burned hospitalized patients.
AB  - During the period between May and December 1988, 21 patients were studied bacteriologically at Hospital Joao XXIII's burn's unit which belongs to "Fundacao Hospitalar do Estado de Minas Gerais" in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of aerobic and facultative bacteria from burn wounds was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antibiotic susceptibility. At the same time an evaluation of those bacteria isolated from the environmental unit was performed. The most common organisms recovered from wounds of patients were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. P. pseudomallei was the most frequent strain recovered from environmental specimens. In nearly all patients specimens (16 in total) from whom P. aeruginosa was isolated, the rate of CFU/cm2 of skin was above 10(2). In nine of these, it reached 10(5), which is equivalent to 10(7) CFU/g of burned tissue.
TI  - Effect of plastic catheter material on bacterial adherence and viability.
AB  - The kinetics of adherence of single isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli to catheters made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), Teflon, siliconised latex, polyurethane and Vialon was evaluated by a radiometric assay. Radiolabelled bacteria (10(8) cfu/ml) were incubated in vials containing 1-cm lengths of catheter for up to 3 days. The peak of maximal adherence to each biomaterial was reached after 24 h for P. aeruginosa and after 72 h for the other strains. Bacterial adherence to PVC and siliconised latex was significantly higher (2-6 times; p less than 0.05) than to the other biomaterials for all the strains. The lowest values of adherence were observed with polyurethane and Vialon for the staphylococci but with Teflon for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Bacterial viability and growth was evaluated in eluates obtained from incubation of segments of each catheter in buffer for 24 h. None of the eluates affected the viability of the staphylococci. However, all of them, significantly increased the growth of E. coli and P. aeruginosa with the exception of the eluate from siliconised latex, in which the inoculum count was reduced to an undetectable level for E. coli. We conclude that bacterial adherence to catheters may depend in part on the nature of the biomaterial and that certain substances eluted from the catheters may affect the viability and growth of different micro-organisms.
TI  - [Common pathogens in burn infection and changes in their drug sensitivity].
AB  - This paper reports common pathogens in burn infection and changes in their drug sensitivity from 1985 to 1988. Gram negative rods constituted 55.7% of all pathogens, while 40.5% were gram positive cocci. The former group consisted of 173 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.5%), 55 Proteus (9.1%), 33 Serratia (5.4%), 23 Klebsiella (3.8%) 19, Acinetobacter (3.1%), 18 Enterobacter (3.0%) and 17 E. coli (2.8%). Among gram-positive cocci, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 32.8%, Staphylococcus epidermidis accounted for 5.6%, and Streptococcus faecalis accounted for 2.1%. All the gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci showed more resistance against various antibiotics. Ps. aeruginosa were resistant to 24 commonly used antibiotics. However, ciprofloxacin, ceftaztdime and piperacillin were comparatively effective, the sensitivity rates were 92.9%, 91.5% and 78.3%, respectively. Ps. aeruginosa showed a sensitivity rate of 92.5% and 86.1% to amikacin and polymyxin-B, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the rates were lowered to 65.9% and 17.3%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988. Staphylococcus aureus showed a sensitivity rate of 88.9% to ciprofloxacin, 76.1% to ceftazidime, 71.4% to amikacin, 48.5% to piperacillin, 63.1% to cefuroxime. This organism showed a sensitivity rate of 87.3%, 83.9%, 81.7% and 82.8% to amikacin, cefoperozone, leucomycin and lincomycin, respectively, from 1980 to 1984, but the sensitivity rates declined to 71.4%, 56.8%, 60.8% and 43.7%, respectively, from 1985 to 1988.
TI  - Antimicrobial treatment of otitis media.
AB  - The major pathogens causing acute otitis media (AOM) are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, with Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus less frequently isolated. The same organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis are found in chronic otitis media with effusion. In chronic suppurative otitis media, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S aureus are most frequently found. Antimicrobial agents found to be most effective in treating AOM are amoxicillin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, erythromycin-sulfisoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil and cefixime are alternatives for which there are less data. Currently, about 20% of AOM cases are caused by beta-lactamase-producing strains (usually H influenzae or M catarrhalis) that are resistant to amoxicillin, thus favoring the use of the other agents listed. Concentrations of antibiotics in middle ear infections range from 10% to 76% of peak serum levels for the listed agents and are higher in AOM than in chronic otitis media with effusion, emphasizing the importance of adequate dosing for successful treatment.
TI  - Infectious keratitis in Baltimore.
AB  - One hundred thirty cases of ulcerative keratitis occurring from 1985 to 1989 at Sinai Hospital of Baltimore were reviewed. Positive corneal cultures were obtained from 40% of cases. The most common isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (28%), S. aureus (16%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa was the most common in contact lens wearers. Antibiotic pretreatment did not affect the rate of positive cultures significantly. Bilateral conjunctival and eyelid margin cultures also were examined. An association was found between corneal and ipsilateral conjunctival isolates (P = .05). Gram stains were consistently negative. Most patients were treated successfully as outpatients. The value of simultaneous conjunctival and eyelid margin cultures and Gram stains was questioned.
TI  - In-vitro activity of WIN 57273 compared to the activity of other fluoroquinolones and two beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - WIN 57273, a new fluoroquinolone, was four to 128-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria. The MIC90 for Staphylococcus aureus was 0.015 mg/l and for S. epidermidis, 0.03 mg/l. All Lancefield group A, B, C, & G streptococci, Streptococcus bovis and S. pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l compared to 0.5 mg/l for tosufloxacin and 2 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. For anaerobic bacteria WIN 57273 had an MIC90 for bacteroides of 1 mg/l, and for Clostridium spp. 0.015.mg/l. WIN 57273 was less active than ciprofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, including aminoglycoside and cephalosporin-resistant isolates. The MIC90 of WIN 57273 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 2 mg/l, compared to 0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin. Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Legionella spp. were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l. WIN 57273 was more active against Gram-negative bacteria at acid pH, but activity was decreased by magnesium ions and an increase in inoculum. Resistant strains were selected after passage on antibiotic-containing agar.
TI  - Aztreonam versus gentamicin for short-term prophylaxis in biliary and gastric surgery.
AB  - Short-term antibiotic prophylaxis was studied in 80 patients undergoing biliary or gastric surgery. The patients were randomized to receive 1 g of aztreonam or 80 mg of gentamicin intravenously 30 minutes before surgery and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. Of samples taken from the abdominal cavity for bacteriologic study, 53% were culture positive. Wound infections developed in two (4.5%) of 44 patients receiving aztreonam and in seven (19.4%) of 36 patients treated with gentamicin. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter species were isolated from sites of wound infection in the aztreonam group; Escherichia coli (two isolates), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two isolates), Enterobacter species, Klebsiella species, Enterococcus faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated from the gentamicin group. Our data indicate that aztreonam is safe and effective for the prevention of infections following biliary and gastric surgery.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Use of quinolones in pediatrics.
AB  - Compared to nalidixic acid, the new quinolones possess an enlarged antimicrobial  spectrum, greatly enhanced bactericidal activity, and substantial pharmacokinetic advantages. Because their activity against streptococci is limited the quinolones presently available will never be included in routine regimens for children. Moreover, adequate pharmacokinetic studies are still lacking in pediatrics, and potential drug toxicity warrants further long-term monitoring. Nevertheless, various studies strongly suggest that there is no quinolone-induced cartilage toxicity in humans, and the results of published clinical trials with fluoroquinolones in pediatric patients show promising efficacy and safety. From a review of the available data it is concluded that use of the quinolones in children should be limited to specific infections which are usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis, and are complicated by underlying pathologic or special conditions such as cystic fibrosis or urologic abnormality. In each case, careful monitoring to determine efficacy, potential adverse effects including drug-drug interaction and toxicity, and any emergence of bacterial resistance is mandatory.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin sodium on respiratory tract infections in lung cancer patients].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was used to treat respiratory tract infections (RTI) in 54 patients with lung cancer. Out of the 54 patients studied, 53 were evaluable for the utility of IPM/CS; 42 had pneumonia, 9 had obstructive pneumonia, 1 had a lung abscess and 1 had acute bronchitis. The efficacy rate was 71.7%. Seventeen causative organisms were isolated from 14 patients. They included Staphylococcus aureus 5 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 4 strains, Staphylococcus sp. 2 strains, Enterococcus faecalis 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 strains, Pseudomonas fluorescens 2 strains, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain, and the eradication rate was 81.8%. Clinical adverse effects (nausea and vomiting) were observed in 1 patient. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 3 patients. They disappeared or returned to normal values after completion of therapy or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for RTI in patients with lung cancer.
TI  - [Preliminary investigation of effect of pyocyanin on common bacteria in burn wound].
AB  - Pyocyanin was extracted from culture medium of Ps. aeruginosa by Frank's method.  Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) & minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of pyocyanin for 6 species of bacteria isolated from burn wounds were determined. The results of MIC & MBC: S. aureus 12.5 micrograms/ml, 50 micrograms/ml; E. coli 25 micrograms/ml, 100 micrograms/ml; P. vulgaris 50 micrograms/ml, 200 micrograms/ml; C. freundii 100 micrograms/ml, 400 micrograms/ml; S. epidermidis 12.5 micrograms/ml, 50 micrograms/ml; no inhibitory effect on Ps. aeruginosa. According to the laboratory results and clinical findings, the authors believe that when there is a dominant growth of Ps. aeruginosa in burn wounds there may be pyocyanin production to inhibit or kill other species of bacteria.
TI  - Effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis on adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and gentamicin-containing PMMA.
AB  - The goals of this study were to determine 1) effect of Staphylococcus epidermidis adherence and biofilm production on adherence of the opportunistic pathogens Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); 2) if the biofilm killed by autoclaving altered adherence of other organisms; 3) if adherence of S. epidermidis to gentamicin-containing PMMA altered adherence of the opportunistic pathogens P. mirabilis and P. aeruginosa to gentamicin-containing PMMA. Results show that biofilms formed by S. epidermidis, whether alive or dead, significantly increased adherence of Pseudomonas. Adherence of Proteus was significantly increased on dead biofilms and increased, but not significantly (p = less than 0.1), on live ones. Greatest adherence seen in the study was to autoclaved biofilms. Significant adherence of Proteus and Pseudomonas was found on gentamicin-containing PMMA specimens, which were preincubated with S. epidermidis for formation on the biofilm. These results indicate that a biofilm is formed on PMMA-gentamicin specimens and this may impair the ability of gentamicin to kill other organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of an oxycephem OCP 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OCP 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at C-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at C-3. OCP 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog ME 1228 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens. Activity against Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii was equivalent. OCP 9-176 was twofold less active than ME-1228 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Activity of the two agents was similar against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Although OCP 9-176 inhibited E. coli containing TEM-1 and TEM-2, it was less active than ME-1228. Klebsiella organisms with SHV-1 and K-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but TEM-3-containing isolates had MICs of 16 micrograms/ml. OCP 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by TEM-1, PSE-1, K-1, and P99, and it was a poor inhibitor of P99. Replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at C-3.
TI  - [Induced bacterial chemiluminescence].
AB  - Oxygen-peroxide-induced superweak luminescence of some microorganisms has been studied by means of the native chemiluminometer KhLM1Ts-01. It is established that total chemiluminescence decrease in the bacteria as follows: Escherichia coli----Bacillus subtilis----Proteus vulgaris----Bacillus mycoides----B. licheniformis----Pseudomonas aeruginosa----Staphylococcus epidermidis----S. aureus----Serratia marcescens----Salmonella enteritidis. A hypothesis is put forward on a possible mechanisms of appearance of the superweak luminescence of bacteria and expediency to use chemoluminometry to differentiate microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies with sodium hyaluronate as a carrier for intraocular gentamicin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro growth of common intraocular pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in rabbit vitreous and in sodium hyaluronate (SH) with and without gentamicin. The minimal inhibitory concentration for gentamicin/SH was 0.5, 0.062 and 2.0 mcg/ml for these pathogens, respectively. After posterior capsulotomy, P. aeruginosa was inoculated into the anterior vitreous and all 15 untreated eyes developed endophthalmitis. In a similar group, aqueous gentamicin administered in the anterior chamber reduced the incidence of endophthalmitis to 10 of 15 eyes. Under similar circumstances, the SH/gentamicin combination lowered the incidence of endophthalmitis significantly to 4 of 15 eyes. The half-life of aqueous gentamicin was 0.9 h, which was shorter than the 2.2 h for SH/gentamicin combination. These results suggest that SH may be a useful carrier for intraocular drug therapy.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - Bacterial isolates in neutropenic febrile patients.
AB  - One hundred consecutive patients with documented bacteremia and neutrophil count  of 0.5 x 10(9)/L or below were retrospectively studied to determine the pattern of infection at the Aga Khan University Hospital in Karachi. These included patients with primary haematologic malignancies presenting with low counts, and those patients with cancer who developed neutropenia as a result of chemotherapy. The gram negative organism pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacterial organism isolated constituting 31% of all positive blood cultures. Gram positive organisms were frequently isolated comprising 24% of all isolates of which 15% were Staph.aureus. Staph. epidermidis was not isolated in this series. Salmonella species were isolated in 9 patients. The other gram negative rods included non-lactose fermenting organisms frequently isolated in a nosocomial setting including Serratia and Acinetobacter. Four patients had positive fungal blood cultures. A single positive anaerobic culture was obtained. Sensitivities of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa reflected the high frequency of resistance seen in nosocomial isolates and those from the community. More than half (54.8%) of the isolates were resistant to carbenicillin and 9.6% resistant to gentamicin. Although 3.2% were resistant to cefotaxime, none were resistant to ofloxacin or ceftazidime reflecting the relatively recent arrival of the latter. In contrast, 23% of Staph. aureus were still sensitive to penicillin. Methicillin (cloxacillin) resistant Staph. aureus did not occur. However 26.6% of the Staph. aureus were resistant to erythromycin. Knowledge of the prevailing pattern of infection permits the development of investigative and therapeutic approaches of optimal efficacy.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of human peritoneal macrophages from patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.
AB  - Peritoneal macrophages (PM) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of bacterial peritonitis, the main complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). We determined the antibacterial activity of PM from 31 PD patients using gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) test organisms. In an 8-hour test assay, PM revealed the highest antibacterial activity against E. coli [median bactericidal index (Bi) = 5.46 representing 0.74 log growth inhibition compared to controls] and the lowest against P. aeruginosa (Bi = 1.63, 0.21 log growth inhibition, p less than 0.05). The antibacterial activity against S. aureus (Bi = 1.99, 0.3 log growth inhibition) and S. epidermidis (Bi = 2.0, 0.31 log growth inhibition) was within this range. When compared to peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PM reached only 4% (S. aureus) and 8.1% (E. coli) of their antibacterial activity (p less than 0.05). Using E. coli as a test organism, PM isolated after a 4-hour dialysis period revealed the highest antibacterial activity when compared to PM isolated after longer dialysis periods (p less than 0.05). Increasing the duration of PD to 6 and 8 h subsequently decreased the antibacterial activity of PM, suggesting that unphysiologic concentrations of toxic metabolites in the peritoneal effluent might have a harmful influence on PM functions.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of goats suffering from clinical PPR: isolation and identification.
AB  - Bacteriological isolation of aerobic bacteria from nasal discharge of achondroplastic West African dwarf goats showing clinical signs of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and the laboratory procedures carried out for the identification of the isolates are described. From a total of forty nasal swabs obtained seventy five isolates were recovered. The percentage frequency of isolation of different organisms in descending order of occurrence is as follows: Staphylococcus 44.0%; Streptococcus 22.67%; Neisseria 12.00%; Pasteurella 10.67%; Pseudomonas 4.00%; Proteus 4.00% and Corynebacterium 1.33%. A further break-down using biochemical tests revealed that Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 30.67% of the total bacteria isolates; Staphylococcus epidermidis 13.33%; Streptococcus viridans 18.67%; Streptococcus pyogenes 4.00%; Neisseria catarrhalis 12.00%; Proteus mirabilis 2.67%; Proteus rettgeri 1.33%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5.33%; Pasteurella multocida 4.00%; Pasteurella haemolytica 6.67% and Corynebacterium pyogenes 1.33%.
TI  - The viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  - In 1988 the University of Wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. This solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. In addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. Prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. However, there are no data on whether UW solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. We undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in UW solution at extended preservation times. Cultures of both aerobic (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (Bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 Macfarland turbidity standard) in both Eurocollins and UW preservation solutions. Samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. The organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. The samples were then incubated at 37 degrees C and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. Our results showed growth of all organisms except S epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. S epi grew in the Eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the UW solution. When the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the UW solution, S epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. These results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in UW solution with extended preservation times. It may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the UW solution and obtain similar results. It is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.
TI  - Sensitivity of bacteria to NaNO2 and to L-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages.
AB  - Sensitivity of bacteria to NO2-/NO and to L-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages was tested. The growth of all bacteria tested, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis, was significantly inhibited by NaNO2 at the concentration of 5 to 10 mM. However, L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism of LPS-activated murine macrophages was ineffective in killing these bacteria. It seems that the concentration of NO2-/NO in phagolysosome in the activated macrophages is insufficient to kill the bacteria in situ. We concluded that L-arginine-dependent effector mechanism can hardly work on bacteria killing in activated macrophages.
TI  - [Comparison of thrombogenic risk between teflon and polyethylene in prolonged catheterization of the radial artery].
AB  - This prospective study was designed to compare the rates of radial artery thrombosis after long-term cannulation with two different types of catheters with similar size. It included 101 patients, randomly assigned to group A (n = 51, 61 +/- 17 years, 80% males), and group B (n = 50, 55.8 +/- 18 years, 54% males). Patients in group A were cannulated with a polyethylene catheter (Leader Cath. 115-09), and those in group B with a Teflon catheter (Plastimed Seldicath). The diagnosis of arterial occlusion was made by way of a bedside angiography performed before catheter removal. An X-ray was taken after injection of 10 to 15 ml Hexabrix through the catheter. The two groups were similar with regard to anthropometric parameters (except for the sex ratio), cannulation technique, used drugs, duration of cannulation, pathological events during the stay in intensive care. The rate of complete arterial thrombosis in the two groups was similar (10%). There were no differences in the rates of partial thrombosis (51 vs. 36%, n.s.) and of absence of thrombosis (39 vs. 54%, n.s.). The rate of arterial thrombosis did not vary with the duration of cannulation, nor with age, sex, systemic heparinization, vascular collapse, cannulation technique. However, 4 polyethylene catheters were infected on removal (coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) versus only one Teflon catheter (Staphylococcus epidermidis). In conclusion, the biocompatibility of Teflon and polyethylene catheters was found to be similar.
TI  - In vitro studies on the microbicidal effectiveness of a xenon-based ultraviolet light device for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis connections.
AB  - Mercury vapor sourced ultraviolet light has been used for several years to disinfect connections that are integral to peritoneal dialysis solution delivery systems. This in vitro study evaluated the suitability of xenon flash sourced ultraviolet light as an effective alternative disinfecting agent. Candida albicans was determined to be at least four times more resistant than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ultraviolet radiation generated by both mercury vapor and xenon flash devices. Both ultraviolet devices effectively disinfected transfer set spikes that were inoculated intraluminally with each of these five test microorganisms suspended in a pool of patient dialysis effluent. However, ultraviolet (254 nm) absorbance values of dialysis effluent was found to vary greatly between patients, with the most ultraviolet-opaque effluent significantly reducing the microbicidal effectiveness of the mercury vapor, but not the xenon flash system.
TI  - Bactericidal effectiveness of modulated UV light.
AB  - Studies were designed to evaluate the effectiveness of pulsed modulated UV light  waveforms for killing bacteria. Exposure of five strains of bacteria to the modulated information encoded in the light decreased the colony population from a confluent lawn to less than 20 colonies. However, approximately 2,000 colonies survived treatment with the same intensity and time of exposure to UV light lacking the modulated information.
TI  - A prospective study of nosocomial infections in cardiac surgery patients in China.
AB  - A prospective survey of postoperative nosocomial infections (NI) in cardiac surgery was carried out in a cardiovascular specialty hospital in Beijing, China. During the period from December 1986 to December 1987, 1208 cardiovascular surgery patients were surveyed for NI. The overall incidence of NI was found to be 7.5%. The incidence of lower respiratory tract and wound infections were 4.5% and 2.9%, respectively. These two kinds of infection accounted for 78.1% of the total infections. After effective control measures were taken at the end of the first 6 months (December 1986 to May 1987) of the study, the incidence fell from 10.6% to 5.1% in the next 7-month period (June to December 1987). The pathogens causing NI were mostly gram-negative bacteria, and they were mainly opportunistic. The contribution of fungal infection was significant in the hospitals. The majority of the pathogenic isolates were highly resistant to the antibiotics commonly used in the hospital.
TI  - Mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  - Unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of Escherichia coli KL16 and Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal DNA. Since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of EDTA, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its DNA, but Staphylococcus epidermidis SK360 and Staph. aureus E3T, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. This suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. Zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.
TI  - [Survey on clinical isolates from 13 hospitals in Akita Prefecture--changes in frequency and susceptibility of isolates by scale of hospital. Survey Group for Clinical Isolates, Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture].
AB  - Isolates from various clinical materials in 13 hospitals in Akita prefecture and  their drug susceptibility were investigated by the Chemotherapy Research Committee of Akita Prefecture during the period from Dec., 1987 to Feb., 1988. The results were as follows: 1. The total number of isolates was 8,387, including Staphylococcus aureus (18.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%) and Enterococcus faecalis (6.6%). S, aureus and P. aeruginosa were detected more frequently in the larger hospitals. 2. The detection frequency of S. aureus from the sputum, throat swab and pus exudate was also very high. There was a diversity in isolates from the urine and the frequency of Escherichia coli was low. More than half of the isolates from the blood were S. epidermidis and S. aureus. Many kinds of bacteria were detected from pleural fluid and ascites, but the isolate showed no particular tendency. 3. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxacillin were variable in hospitals, and the susceptibility to cefazolin were even lower. Low susceptibility were also seen with norfloxacin. S. aureus showed the highest susceptibility to minocycline. The susceptibility was lower for inpatients than for outpatients. P. aeruginosa showed low susceptibility to cefsulodin. The number of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae isolates tended to decrease. Enterobacter cloacae showed a low susceptibility for cephems. Serratia marcescens showed low susceptibility to many drugs. Based on the above results, we concluded that attention should be paid to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter in clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteremia originated in intravascular cannulae: an epidemiologic study of 91 episodes].
AB  - This reports the analysis of an epidemiologic study of intravascular cannula bacteriemia (ICB) in a Barcelona university hospital. There were 91 episodes of ICB representing the 26.7% of the total hospital bacteriemia. In 60.6% of ICB the diagnosis was made in an intensive care area. The most common microorganisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis (27.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus (14.4%). Intravascular cannulae with higher incidence of bacteriemia were the central venous catheters (55%) and the arterial lines (29%). Bacteriemia produced by arterial lines had short free period interval (7.7 days) and in 80% of the cases were produced by Gram negative bacteria whereas that bacteriemia produced by central venous catheters had a long free period (11.2 days) and the most frequent agents were Gram positive bacteria. The overall mortality was 17% and that attributed to the infection 6%. An age above 65 years had a mortality rate of 33% and was identified as the only significant prognostic factor (p less than 0.001). The mean hospitalization period was 49.9 days and the cost of the treatment 830.000 ptas/patient.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Assessment of a new hub design and the semiquantitative catheter culture method using an in vivo experimental model of catheter sepsis.
AB  - An in vivo model of hub-related catheter sepsis in rabbits is reported. The model was used to investigate the protection offered by a new hub design against external contamination by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis and to reassess the diagnostic value of the semiquantitative culture method in bacteremia of endoluminal origin. Contamination of conventional Luer-Lock connectors was followed by clinical sepsis, positive catheter segment cultures, or both, whereas contamination of the new hub was followed by complete protection. Clinical and bacteriological discrepancies observed between contamination with P. aeruginosa and S. epidermidis suggest that the virulence of microorganisms may account for differences in the natural history of hub-originated catheter sepsis. The semiquantitative extraluminal method for catheter culture yielded less than 15 CFU in three animals with proven bacteremia and should not be used as the "gold standard" to define catheter-related bacteremia.
TI  - Prospective multicenter study of vascular-catheter-related complications and risk factors for positive central-catheter cultures in intensive care unit patients.
AB  - To determine the incidence rate of complications associated with vascular catheters in intensive care unit patients and to analyze risk factors for a positive vascular culture, we performed a multicenter study of intensive care unit patients at eight French hospitals. During the study period, 865 intravenous catheters were inserted in 566 patients; 362 (41.8%) were peripheral catheters, and 503 (58.2%) were central catheters. Local complications (i.e., infiltration) occurred significantly more often with peripheral than with central catheters (P less than 0.001); in contrast, fever and bacteremia were significantly more often associated with central than with peripheral catheters (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). The culture of the vascular-catheter tip was positive for 24% of central catheters (32 of 1,000 catheters days) and for 9% of peripheral catheters (21 of 1,000 catheters days). Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common microorganism isolated from both peripheral and central catheters, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No significant risk factor associated with positive cultures for peripheral catheters was found by univariate analysis. In contrast, the purpose of the cannula (nutrition and monitoring of central venous pressure), the insertion site (jugular), the dressing type (semipermeable transparent dressing), the antiseptic used to prepare the insertion site (povidone iodine), and routine changing of the intravenous administration set were significantly associated with positive cultures of central catheters. Three factors, duration of catheterization, use of a semipermeable transparent dressing, and the jugular insertion site, were found to be independently associated with positive cultures of central catheters by multivariate analysis.
TI  - Synthesis of 3-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The synthesis of some 3-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine derivatives is performed by reacting 2-(3-amino-1,2-dihydro-5-oxo-5H-pyrazol-4-il)-1,3,4- thiadiazoles with 2,4-pentanedione, ethyl 3-oxobutyrate and diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds is reported.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of previously infected or inflamed vitreous.
AB  - The authors investigated the ability of vitreous harvested from eyes previously infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis or inflamed with heat-killed cells of the same organism to support subsequent in vitro bacterial growth. Growth of S. epidermidis and S. aureus was not supported by previously inflamed or previously infected vitreous, but Pseudomonas aerugnosa grew in all samples. These findings suggest induction of an antistaphylococcal substance by infection or inflammation of rabbit vitreous by S. epidermidis.
TI  - The effect of protein and urine on uropathogen adhesion to polymer substrata.
AB  - Uropathogenic adhesion was measured using a range of polymer materials with differing surface tension properties. Experiments were carried out in the presence of phosphate buffered saline (controls), Tamm Horsfall protein (THP), and human urine with quantitation by image analysis. The results showed that THP did not bind to the polymer materials and therefore did not act as a receptor surface for type 1 fimbriated Escherichia coli. However, the THP did interfere with adhesion by binding directly to these organisms as well as to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and, to a lesser extent, Proteus mirabilis. Incubation of the uropathogens in THP and urine resulted in altered adhesion profiles to polymer surfaces, with no single trend apparent. The results emphasize that fluid components, particularly proteins, and substratum surface tension influence bacterial adhesion to biomaterials.
TI  - Double-blind comparison of pefloxacin and cefazolin as prophylaxis in elective cardiovascular surgery.
AB  - A total of 162 patients (134 males and 28 females) scheduled for coronary artery  bypass grafting (144) or valve surgery (18) were randomly assigned to receive, under double-blind conditions, either pefloxacin 400 mg iv or cefazolin 1.0 g 30 min before the surgical incision and then post-operatively 12-hourly x 4 or 6-hourly x 8, respectively. Positive per- and post-operative cultures were seen in 27 patients (11 pefloxacin, 16 cefazolin) and 47 micro-organisms were isolated: 34 per-operatively (21 pefloxacin, 13 cefazolin) and 13 post-operatively (4 pefloxacin, 9 cefazolin). There were five failures of prophylaxis (2 pefloxacin, 3 cefazolin): two early (less than 5 days: 1 pefloxacin, 1 cefazolin) and three late (greater than or equal to 5 days, 1 pefloxacin, 2 cefazolin) divided into (i) one major primary failure in the cefazolin group (1 cefazolin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis mediastinitis); (ii) two minor primary failures, one in each group (Gram-positive sternal incision abscesses) and (iii) two secondary failures (1 cefazolin resistant Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa UTI in the cefazolin group and one culture negative pneumonia in the pefloxacin group). Tolerance to both antibiotics was excellent. In our sample of patients, the efficacy and safety of pefloxacin was not different from those of cefazolin in prophylaxis in cardiovascular surgery.
TI  - Modulation of cell adhesion by modification of titanium surfaces with covalently  attached self-assembled monolayers.
AB  - The surface of titanium has been modified by covalent attachment of an organic monolayer anchored by a siloxane network. This coating completely covers the metal and allows controlled modification of surface properties by the exposed chemical endgroups of the monolayer forming surfactant. The attachment of such a film allows different bulk materials (e.g., glass and titanium) to have identical surface properties and this can be used in regulating cell adhesion responses. This control over surface functionality can modulate the functions of fibronectin in regulating attachment and neurite formation by neuronal cells. The effect on bacterial adherence that is achieved by using such monolayers to vary surface hydrophilicity is also assessed.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion of NFLX after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. The mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. The mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. The mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. A dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. The clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of NFLX were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. In 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. Staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Escherichia coli 10 strains, Salmonella sp. 5 strains, Morganella morganii 1 strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, Haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and Campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. Bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of C. jejuni only decreased. With regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. No abnormal laboratory test data were observed. From the above results, NFLX was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A case of Fournier's gangrene: was it triggered by prostatic massage?].
AB  - We have experienced a case of Fournier's gangrene which progressed rapidly after  prostatic massage. The patient was a 70-year-old man who had poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hemorrhoid, urethral stricture and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He visited an urologist complaining of pollakisuria and miction pain. Under the diagnosis of prostatitis, prostatic massage was performed. From that night, he developed a high grade fever. Simultaneously, redness, swelling and pain of the scrotum progressed rapidly, and 11 days later, he was admitted to our hospital. An X-ray examination revealed subcutaneous gas formation in the scrotum. Immediately, incision and drainage with extensive debridement of necrotic tissue were performed combined with chemotherapy using broad spectrum antibiotics and insulin therapy. About 3 months later, the gangrene and the wound were healed with granulation and scarring. Cultures of the pus and the necrotic tissue from the scrotum were positive for Bacteroides fragilis and several aerobes including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The case proved to be non-clostridial gas gangrene.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of local anesthetics].
AB  - In order to study the antibacterial activity of local anesthetics quantitatively, we procured their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), killing curves and postantibiotic effect (PAE), using the standard colony of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 10490. Both bupivacaine and lidocaine had bactericidal activity at a clinical concentration. MIC of the former was lower than that of the latter, and it means that bupivacaine has a greater antibacterial activity than lidocaine. At the same concentration, the commercial solutions, such as Xylocaine and Marcain, which contain preservatives, showed a greater antibacterial activity than the pure anesthetic solutions which contain no preservatives. However, the preservatives had no bactericidal activity, but weak bacteriostatic activity.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to urethral catheters.
AB  - Closed sterile catheter drainage has markedly reduced the incidence of nosocomial urinary tract infections. Infections that occur during closed drainage must ascend by colonizing the catheter or urethra. Our study compared adherence by different bacterial species to different catheter surfaces. We found no bacteria adhering to the hydrophilic catheter surface. Of the gram-negative bacteria Proteus mirabilis showed the greatest adherence to the other catheters and it, like most bacteria, showed the most marked adherence to the red rubber catheter.
TI  - Cervical osteomyelitis due to i.v. heroin use: radiologic findings in 14 patients.
AB  - We reviewed the radiographs of 14 patients who had cervical osteomyelitis and were IV heroin users. Eleven were men and three were women. Their age range was 33-48 years (mean, 39 years). Eleven regularly used the jugular vein access, and three alternated between the jugular and femoral veins. Initial radiographs of the cervical spine in 13 patients showed destruction of two or more vertebral bodies and the adjacent intervertebral disk, as well as a prevertebral soft-tissue mass. In one patient, findings on initial radiographs were normal, but marked destruction at two contiguous intervertebral levels and a large prevertebral abscess were identified 2 weeks later. All the patients had positive results on cultures of joint aspirates or bone biopsy materials (10 patients) or blood (four patients). Ten grew Staphylococcus aureus; two, Staphylococcus epidermidis; one, Streptococcus viridans; and one, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CT in nine patients showed inflammatory reaction adjacent to the carotid sheath resulting from the repeated jugular injections and delineated the extent of prevertebral abscess and bone destruction. Scintigrams were of minimal value in establishing the diagnosis. Advanced vertebral body destruction, disk space infection, prevertebral abscess, and anterior cervical inflammatory reaction appear to be typical findings on radiographs in heroin abusers with cervical osteomyelitis.
TI  - Bacteria from solid tumours.
AB  - Bacteria were grown from 63 (69%) of 91 specimens from necrotic tumours in 63 patients. Of the tumours, 14 were abdominal, 5 pelvic, 23 of the head and neck, 4 of the lungs, 4 mediastinal, 2 lymphatic, 3 of the breast, and 8 were miscellaneous. Aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria only were present in 12 (19%) specimens, anaerobes only in 10 (16%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 41 (65%). A total of 83 anaerobic and 47 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were isolated. The predominant anaerobic bacteria were Bacteroides spp. (36 isolates), and anaerobic cocci (21) and Propionibacterium acnes (22). The aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria most frequently isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli (seven isolates each), S. epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five isolates each). These data demonstrate that infection of tumours is usually polymicrobial.
TI  - The effect of the Y-set on catheter infection rates in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.
AB  - We hypothesized that catheter infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients may be reduced with a disconnect system. We examined this theory in 116 CAPD patients over a 2-year period. In CAPD patients who switched to the Y-set (n = 22), the catheter infection rate decreased from one per 13 patient-months to one per 26 patient-months (P = 0.05), whereas the catheter infection rate in matched controls (n = 22) remained unchanged. Patients who began CAPD using the Y-set (n = 36) had catheter infection rates of one per 14 patient-months versus one per 8 patient-months in matched controls (n = 36, P = 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of catheter infections in both groups of patients. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa replaced Staphylococcus epidermidis as the second most common cause of catheter infections in the patients using the Y-set. The number of catheters that had to be removed due to catheter infections, mainly those due to S aureus or P aeruginosa, was the same in the Y-set and control groups. We conclude that the Y-set system is associated with reduced numbers of catheter infections, but that catheter loss from catheter infections remains a serious problem.
TI  - Patterns of bacterial infection in calves implanted with artificial hearts.
AB  - Device-related infection is one of the most serious potential consequences of total artificial heart (TAH) implantation. This complication must be addressed before the full potential benefit of these devices, especially fully implantable devices, can be realized. A review of research reports and clinical data was conducted to ascertain if similarities existed between the patterns of infection reported in human TAH recipients and those seen in the experimental animal models. Infection was reported in approximately 57% of the human TAH recipients and approximately 47% of the implanted animals. Implant periods ranged from 1-620 days for the humans, and 32-287 days for the animals. The spectrum of organisms isolated from both groups were similar, with a high proportion of infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, numerous isolates of Enterobacter and Enterococci were obtained from the animals. Positive blood cultures have often been observed in animals within 2-4 weeks following implantation of the devices. The similarities noted in this review suggest that the calf may be an appropriate animal model in which to study the pathogenesis of TAH-related infection.
TI  - Parenteral fluoroquinolones in children with life-threatening infections.
AB  - The new fluoroquinolones have not been tested in children despite their wide spectrum of in vitro activity and efficacy, because of an observed damage to cartilage in young animals. However, in some cases they may be life-saving. We present three pediatric patients with life threatening infections in whom the fluoroquinolones were used when other antibiotics failed: A seven-year-old boy with meningitis due to multiresistant Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a three-year-old boy with Job's syndrome with line sepsis due to Staphylococcus epidermidis and a four month-old boy with agammaglobulinemia with mixed infection due to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. All three children were cured of their infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of  imipenem and ceftazidime. LJC10,627 had broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. The MICs of this compound for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. LJC10,627 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at an MIC90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. This compound inhibited Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species at MIC90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. LJC10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at MIC90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against Bacteroides fragilis at an MIC90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. LJC10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for Xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type II. LJC10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase I; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. Killing kinetics of this compound for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the MIC (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). LJC10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1B(s) of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - A new approach to optimal antibiotic dosage regimen by coupling pharmacokinetics  and killing curve parameters.
AB  - Antibiotic therapy is directed against bacteria responsible for infectious pathology which are able to resist treatment mainly when the dosage is misadapted. The choice of the initial dosage regimen actually takes into account toxicological, bacteriological and pharmacokinetic parameters. The determination of the classical bacteriological data is performed in vitro using fixed drug concentrations that are far from human therapy conditions, and moreover the efficiency is not well defined. The estimation of the pharmacokinetic parameters is realized in animals, healthy subjects or ill patients but takes into account only the drug disposition without correspondence with the kinetics of the antibiotic effect on the bacteria. Thus, each type of evaluation is made independently from the others without any correlation between the observed phenomena. It appears, therefore, interesting to propose a new approach including pharmacokinetic and bacteriological data to enable approximation of drug efficacy. The coupled evaluation of individual pharmacokinetic estimation and the killing curve determinations of an antibiotic will allow this type of development. On the basis of these data, a preliminary profile of the optimal dosage would be possible. This methodology has been applied to three antibiotics: teicoplanin, amikacin and ofloxacin and demonstrates a time- or dose-dependent activity, with interesting possibilities for optimization of dosage.
TI  - Effects of room-temperature exposure on bacterial growth in stored red cells.
AB  - Experiments were performed to determine the effect of room-temperature (RT) exposure on the growth rates of selected bacteria by deliberate contamination of AS-1 packed red cell (RBC) units contained in PL146 plastic bags. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, and Yersinia enterocolitica were inoculated into 3- to 5-day-old packed RBC units. The units were refrigerated at 4 to 6 degrees C for 14 days. On two occasions during this period, one-half of the units were removed from the refrigerator and held at 25 to 26 degrees C for 2 hours. Timed samples taken during the periods at RT revealed stable or decreasing bacterial counts in the majority of exposed units, and in no instance was a marked increase in bacterial growth observed. Samples taken after subsequent prolonged rerefrigeration showed no significant increase in bacterial counts as compared with those in control units that were refrigerated constantly. These results indicate that RT exposure of contaminated RBC units does not result in accelerated bacterial proliferation over a period of 2 hours and that it may, in fact, have a detrimental effect on bacterial growth.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - [Development of resistance to antibiotic therapy at a polyvalent intensive care unit during 3 years].
AB  - The antibiotherapy resistance evolution and the appearance of new enterobacter in our ICU's flora have been studied. A total of 638 bacterial samples were studied. The most frequent isolated pathogens were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (182 strands), Escherichia coli (108 strands), Staphylococcus epidermidis (99 strands) and Staphylococcus aureus (41 strands). These four types of bacteria have been used to evaluate the antibiotic resistance variations over a period of time, which have only been significant for Pseudomonas with an increased number of amikamicine's resistant strands after the second year (p less than 0.001) and the of one multiresistant strand to piperaciline and amikamicine this second year, and four (8%) the year after. There are not significant differences in the resistance of E. Coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis over this period of time. We have not observed new enterobacter strands over the time this study was performed although a higher incidence of Serratia (p less than 0.05) and Enterobacter (p less than 0.05) have been detected between the first and the third year, respectively.
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Recurrent postoperative endophthalmitis.
AB  - We treated five patients for postoperative endophthalmitis who demonstrated an initially good response to intravitreal management of their infection and then suffered a later recurrence. Four of the five patients received a single intravitreal injection of antibiotics as the only intravitreal therapy, and the fifth patient received a single antibiotic injection in addition to a partial vitrectomy. All recurrent infections occurred between 10 and 21 days after the original intravitreal injection of antibiotics. At the time of the recurrence, all five patients remained culture positive with the same organism that was initially isolated. The bacterial species isolated were S. epidermidis, group D streptococcus, P. acnes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa. All patients were ultimately sterilized with repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, vitrectomy, and/or intraocular lens removal. Factors that were related to recurrent infection were marginal susceptibility of the organism to the originally injected antibiotics, infection with a slowly replicating organism, and infection with a gram-negative bacillus. A single intravitreal injection of antibiotics may only partially treat bacterial endophthalmitis. Patients should be observed for at least 3 weeks following treatment of endophthalmitis for recurrence of their infection, and aggressive management, including vitrectomy and repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics, should be used to treat recurrent infections.
TI  - Glycocalyx positive bacteria isolated from chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis.
AB  - Bacterial cultures isolated from cases of chronic osteomyelitis and septic arthritis were screened for the production of glycocalyx. The presence of glycocalyx was noted in 76.3% of Staphylococcus aureus, 57.14% of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 50% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 75% of Escherichia coli isolates.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of the main opportunistic pathogenic aerobic bacteria].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 1421 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. was studied. Gentamicin, levomycetin (chloramphenicol) and ristomycin proved to be the antibiotics of choice in treatment of purulent inflammatory diseases caused by S. epidermidis and S. aureus. For antibiotic therapy of infections caused by gram-negative organisms gentamicin and polymixin might be recommended.
TI  - The phototoxic inhibitory effect and phototoxic killing effect of micro-organisms.
AB  - The toxic and phototoxic growth inhibitory and killing effect of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenus gr. A, St. viridans, Pityrosporum ovale and Candida albicans were studied. P. ovale and St. viridans were the only micro-organisms with any toxic effect against the other micro-organisms tested. P. ovale inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa and E. coli. St. viridans inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Ps. aeruginosa, E. coli, St. pyogenus gr. A and P. ovale. This effect was only growth inhibitory and not direct killing. The activity was increased by UVA on S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Ps. aeruginosa but not on E. coli and St. pyogenes gr. A. These effects of P. ovale and St. viridans may be of importance in the defense against infections.
TI  - Neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - All babies admitted to the neonatal unit during a period of 41 months were prospectively studied to find out the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of neonatal pneumonia, and the value of routine cultures of endotracheal tubes. Pneumonia of early onset (before age 48 hours) occurred in 35 babies (incidence 1.79/1000 live births). In 20 (57%) it was caused by group B streptococci. Blood cultures showed the presence of organisms in 16 of the 35 (46%). There were 41 episodes of pneumonia of late onset in 39 babies. Thirty six of the 39 were preterm, and 34 were artificially ventilated (10% of all ventilated babies). Endotracheal tube colonisation had occurred in 94% of these, most commonly by Gram negative organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In only one of seven cases with simultaneous bacteraemia was the same organism grown from cultures of the blood. After controlling for gestational age and duration of artificial ventilation there was no difference in the incidence or timing of endotracheal tube colonisation between babies who did and did not have pneumonia of late onset. Ten babies with pneumonia of early onset (29%) died; all were preterm infants. Only one death (2%) was associated with an episode of pneumonia of late onset. Routine surveillance cultures were not helpful in predicting and managing pneumonia of late onset.
TI  - Differential effects of a gram-negative and a gram-positive infection on autogenous and prosthetic grafts.
AB  - A canine model was developed to study the differential response of a gram-negative and a gram-positive bacterial infection on autogenous and prosthetic grafts. After replacing segments of the femoral arteries of 15 dogs with autogenous vein in one groin and polytetrafluoroethylene in the contralateral groin, 10(8) colony-forming units of nonmucin-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (five dogs), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five dogs), or sterile saline solution (five dogs) were directly inoculated onto the grafts. The grafts were examined 7 to 10 days after implantation. None of the control dogs exhibited inflammatory signs, and no grafts or anastomoses disrupted. S. epidermidis was unrecoverable from either graft material in any of the animals, although histologic evaluation confirmed neutrophils and bacteria in four of five animals in the vein and polytetrafluoroethylene groups. No dog inoculated with S. epidermidis had graft or anastomotic disruption. By contrast, P. aeruginosa was recovered from both types of grafts in all inoculated animals. Neutrophils, bacteria, and microabscesses were observed in all of these animals. In addition, three of five polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and all five vein grafts disrupted either at the anastomoses or in the body of the vein graft. Therefore S. epidermidis is a less virulent organism that may persist in graft walls despite negative cultures, whereas P. aeruginosa is a highly virulent organism that can disrupt native artery, vein grafts, and anastomoses. The graft material appears to be less important than the bacteria in determining the outcome of infection.
TI  - Three-year experience with sonicated vascular catheter cultures in a clinical microbiology laboratory.
AB  - Using a quantitative sonication method, we cultured 1,681 consecutive vascular catheters submitted to a clinical microbiology laboratory in a 36-month period. A total of 46% of the cultures were positive; the most common organisms isolated were coagulase-negative staphylococci (36.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), enterococci (10.0%), yeasts (9.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (5.8%), and Enterobacter species (4.4%). The frequencies of positive blood cultures within 48 h prior to a positive catheter culture result were as follows: Candida albicans (68.4%), S. aureus (60%), Enterobacter cloacae (42.9%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (32.1%), P. aeruginosa (27.7%), and enterococci (23.3%). The sonication method allowed quantification of the number of CFU removed from a catheter for between 10(2) and 10(7) CFU. For catheter cultures in which greater than or equal to 10(2) CFU grew, a linear regression equation could be calculated: (risk of positive blood culture for the same organism) = 14 [log10 (number of organisms removed from the catheter)] -21 (r = 0.93). For catheter cultures in which less than 10(2) CFU grew, positive blood cultures for the same organism were strongly associated with a proven infection at a site distant from the catheter (P = 0.001) or probable contamination (S. epidermidis). Our findings indicate that this technique has considerable potential for use in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in the diagnosis of vascular catheter infections and for clinical investigations into the pathogenesis of these infections.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - Toxicity and clearance of intravitreal cefotetan.
AB  - Direct intravitreal injection of antibiotics plays an important role in the management of bacterial endophthalmitis. In the present study we investigated the toxicity and clearance of intravitreally injected cefotetan in a rabbit model. No toxic ocular side effects could be detected by electroretinography (ERG) or light and electron microscopy up to and including a single intravitreal dose of 1000 micrograms. Intravitreal injection of 2000 micrograms cefotetan resulted in mild degeneration of photoreceptor outer segments and, sporadically, in cataract formation. After intravitreal injection of 4000 micrograms, moderate toxic degeneration of photoreceptors occurred, with displacement and mitochondrial swelling of inner segments. In addition, lysosomal lamellar inclusion bodies could be detected in pigment epithelial cells. After a single intravitreal injection of 1000 micrograms cefotetan, concentrations greater than the minimum necessary for the inhibition of most commonly occurring intraocular pathogens (except Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis) were maintained in the vitreous humor for greater than 48 h. Cefotetan may be a potentially important drug for intravitreal injection, especially in cases of gram-negative and suspected anaerobic endophthalmitis.
TI  - [Incidence of nosocomial infections in an cancer center: clinical and bacteriologic data].
AB  - Over a 5 month period, a study of the incidence of nosocomial infections (NI) was carried out in the Leon Berard Oncology Center (Lyons). It comprised 1,551 patients classified in groups according to the site of origin of the underlying malignancy. The respective frequency of the different types of nosocomial infections and the responsible agents was evaluated in each group and the incidence was calculated per day of hospitalization. The overall incidence of NI was 11.29 per 1,000 patient-days, with a maximal value of 20.04 for patients suffering from lymphomas. The most frequently encountered infections were bacteremias (22.7%), followed by urinary tract infections (20.8%) and wound infections (20.5%). The most frequent causative agents of NI were Escherichia coli (25.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.8%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.8%). The latter micro-organism together with Escherichia coli were the most frequent causative agents of bacteremias. Even though cancer patients are particularly prone to developing infections, the incidence of NI could be reduced thanks to a program of control and surveillance of infectious episodes during hospitalization.
TI  - Lytic effect of Vibrio cholerae elastase on gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Elastase of Vibrio cholerae caused the lysis of freshly grown cells of Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi A and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) organisms were resistant to this enzyme. Heat killed and lyophilized Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (except S. aureus and S. epidermidis) showed higher sensitivity to elastase. Both Gram-negative and -positive bacteria were lyzed maximally by elastase at pH 8.0. At this pH, lytic activity of elastase was maximum in Tris-HCl and glycine-NaOH buffers followed by Tris-maleate and cacodylate buffers.
TI  - [Community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. III. Microbiological aspects].
AB  - A retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the Ivrea-Castellamonte Hospital (Turin, Italy). A total of 4386 vials from 619 patients were examined. There were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). Ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. There were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). A total of 165 microorganism were isolated: Gram-positive (52.7%) and Gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). The predominant families were: Enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), Micrococcaceae (27.3%), Pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), Bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and Streptococcus "Genus" (18.8%). The species frequencies were: Escherichia coli (20%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), Enterococcus (8.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), Proteus mirabilis (4.2%), Brucella spp. (2.4%), Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus bovis e Propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). These findings are compared with those published in the Italian and international literature. Stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - [The conjunctival flora of HIV-positive patients in an advanced stage].
AB  - We evaluated the incidence of bacterial cultures taken from 23 outpatient and nosocomial AIDS patients. It was found that 36.6% of the 11 outpatients had non-pathogenic bacterial flora (Staphylococcus epidermis). Staphylococcus aureus as a pathogenic bacterium was found in 25% of the positive cultures in a group of 12 nosocomial patients. Candida albicans, a fungus, was also found in 25%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the only gram-negative bacteria, was identified in 8.3%. Staphylococcus epidermidis was found in 18.8%. It was concluded that preoperative cultures of the conjunctival sac of hospitalized AIDS patients are essential before intraocular procedures are carried out. There must be no apparent infection of the conjunctiva.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of natural products: 1. Propolis.
AB  - Material extracted from propolis (bee glue) by alkaline aqueous solvents or organic solvents showed weak inhibitory activity in vitro against certain species of Gram-positive bacteria. No antimicrobial activity was detected in urine from three volunteers who had taken 500 mg propolis three times a day for 3 days.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activity of cefpirome and cefotaxime against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Using a broth microtiter dilution method, minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined for the aminothiazolyl cephalosporins cefpirome and cefotaxime against 436 blood culture isolates. At concentrations of less than or equal to 16 mg/l, cefpirome inhibited 82.3% of the isolates and cefotaxime 66.5%. At the same concentrations, cefpirome killed 60.0% of the isolates and cefotaxime 46.7%. Whereas the MIC values indicated a far better activity of cefpirome than cefotaxime against oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MBC values showed a poor activity of both drugs against these strains. By comparison, cefpirome was the more active agent, covering a similar spectrum to that of cefotaxime with a slight additional activity against oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Nontoxic concentration of ceftazidime and flomoxef sodium for intravitreal use--evaluated by in-vitro ERG.
AB  - The effects of ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef sodium (FMOX) on the in-vitro electroretinogram (ERG) of albino rabbits were studied. The a-wave, the b-wave and the oscillatory potential (OP) were unchanged by 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ-containing solution. The OP was suppressed by 0.5mM (0.32mg/ml) CAZ. The a-wave, the b-wave and the OP were unchanged by 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX. The OP was suppressed and its peak latency was delayed by 2mM (0.52mg/ml) FMOX. The concentration of 0.3mM (0.19mg/ml) CAZ was higher than its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes. The concentration of 0.5mM (0.26mg/ml) FMOX was higher than its MIC against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens and Propionibacterium acnes.
TI  - Evaluation of pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in the treatment of thirty-nine cases of chronic osteomyelitis.
AB  - From October 1983 to October 1986, 39 patients with chronic osteomyelitis (of at  least two month's duration) were treated with either pefloxacin (n = 15), ofloxacin (n = 17), or ciprofloxacin (n = 7). The length of treatment ranged from 3 to 6 months; follow-up examinations were performed up until July 1988. The infecting bacterial strains (19 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 10 Escherichia coli, 8 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were all sensitive to the quinolone prescribed. Twenty-nine of the 38 evaluable patients had a satisfactory outcome at follow-up examinations 14 to 48 months after the end of treatment. Fourteen of the 21 patients with gram-positive bacterial infections responded satisfactorily, as did 15 of the 17 patients infected by gram-negative bacteria. Nine cases of failure were observed (2 for pefloxacin, 4 for ofloxacin, 3 for ciprofloxacin). The infecting bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin). The infecting bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus in six cases (3 on ofloxacin, 3 on ciprofloxacin), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (ofloxacin), Escherichia coli (pefloxacin), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pefloxacin) in one case each. In all these cases, local conditions (presence of a foreign body in 5 cases, sequestra in 3, and post-radiotherapy necrosis in 1) could have been responsible for treatment failure. Tolerance was good; adverse effects observed in the pefloxacin and ofloxacin groups disappeared after treatment was ended. Bone levels varied but were always superior to the MIC for the pathogen. In view of the satisfactory results, the possibility of oral administration, and the good tolerance, these quinolones should be considered as alternative agents for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.
TI  - In vitro bacteriological study of a new hub model for intravascular catheters and infusion equipment.
AB  - We investigated in vitro the antibacterial properties of a simulated new hub model in which the female part has an antiseptic chamber through which the needle (male part) must pass before connection of the set and the catheter. To establish the time needed for disinfection, the magnitude of reduction of the contaminating inocula by the new hub model, and the antibacterial properties of the different components of the hub, we used needles contaminated with solutions containing high inocula (1.9 x 10(7) to 1.2 x 10(11) CFU/ml) of microorganisms involved in hub-related catheter sepsis. Sterilization of the needles was accomplished by allowing them to remain in the antiseptic chamber for 10 s in all assays with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The rubber closures limiting the antiseptic chamber and the dilution effect of the antiseptic itself accounted for a minor part of the inoculum reduction achieved by the new hub model. This simulated hub provides good protection against endoluminal contamination. Further studies seem warranted to prove its industrial viability and clinical efficacy.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Deficient intracellular killing of bacteria by murine alveolar macrophages.
AB  - Microbiologic methods were used to assess the in vitro phagocytosis and intracellular killing of various species of bacteria by freshly isolated murine peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages showed effective phagocytosis of opsonized Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Listeria monocytogenes, and moderate ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Alveolar macrophages were poor in phagocytosing opsonized S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and E. coli; ingestion of S. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis was moderate. Peritoneal macrophages killed 40 to 80% of these bacteria intracellularly, but alveolar macrophages showed almost no intracellular killing of bacteria. To find out whether there is a correlation between the poor bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages and the oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms of these cells, we determined the uptake of oxygen and the release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by macrophages at rest and after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or opsonized S. aureus. Upon exposure to these stimuli, peritoneal macrophages, but not alveolar macrophages, showed an increased uptake of oxygen and release of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Because alveolar macrophages contain surface active material (SAM), we investigated the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of bacteria and the release of hydrogen peroxide by peritoneal macrophages pretreated with SAM. The results showed reduced phagocytosis and impaired intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by these macrophages. The release of hydrogen peroxide by SAM-pretreated peritoneal macrophages upon stimulation with PMA or opsonized S. aureus was equal to that of the control peritoneal macrophages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The effect of staphylococci on the manifestation of opsonic cooperation in the complement system].
AB  - The influence of the cultures of 14 Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains on the capacity of factor C3b of the complement for mediating the adhesive reaction of human neutrophils was studied. In experiments with 5 out of 11 S. aureus strains the essential weakening of reactions was registered, while one of the strains considerably enhanced reactions. Out of 3 S. epidermidis strains, the weakening of C3b-dependent reaction was noted in one case. The activity of the cultures did not correlate with the gelatinase properties of staphylococci and was absent in all gelatinase-positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The model worked out by the authors may be used for studying the influence of bacterial metabolites and biologically active substances on the effector properties of factor C3b of the complement.
TI  - The comparative in vitro activity of ofloxacin and selected ophthalmic antimicrobial agents against ocular bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone anti-infective agent, was evaluated against 419 ocular bacterial isolates of 55 species to determine its potential as a topical agent for the treatment of ocular infections. Other agents tested in this study, in which a modified tube-dilution procedure was used, include norfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, chloramphenicol, and polymyxin B. Ofloxacin demonstrated good to excellent activity against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The minimum inhibitory concentration against 90% of all bacterial strains tested (MIC90) of ofloxacin was 0.5 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, 2 micrograms/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 4 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These species were more susceptible to ofloxacin than to any of the nonquinolones tested. The MIC90 of ofloxacin was lower than that of norfloxacin, another quinolone, against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and St. pneumoniae and equal to that of norfloxacin against P. aeruginosa. Because of its broad spectrum of activity and excellent in vitro activity, we concluded that ofloxacin has the potential for development into a superior topical treatment for ocular infection.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) compared with other oral agents.
AB  - The bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of cefetamet (Ro 15-8074) were compared with those of cefadroxil, cefaclor, ampicillin, doxycycline, chloramphenicol and erythromycin against a total of 400 bacterial strains isolated from nosocomial respiratory tract and auditory canal infections. The broth macrodilution method was used to determine antimicrobial susceptibility. None of the compounds was effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. Cefetamet was very active against ampicillin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli strains with the minimal inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the strains tested ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/l. Cefetamet at a concentration of 8 mg/l inhibited 90% of Enterobacter aerogenes and 60% of S. epidermidis strains. In biophotometric studies, subinhibitory concentrations of cefetamet greatly lengthened the lag-phase and flattened the log-phase, the extent varying with the concentrations and species tested. It did not cause detectable lysis in the stationary-phase of the cultures. Adding two to 32 times inhibitory concentrations of cefetamet to middle-log cultures, no or moderate lysis occurred., except with Esch. coli. This observation suggests that cefetamet is primarily bacteriostatic for some of the strains tested.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of meropenem and interactions with other antibiotics.
AB  - MICs of meropenem for selected clinical isolates of bacteria were determined. Killing curves were performed on strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii and Acinetobacter spp. A reduction of greater than or equal to 3 x log10 in viable cells was observed at 4 and 6 h of exposure to 4 and 8 x MIC, and this was usually maintained at 24 h (with a few exceptions for methicillin-resistant Staph, epidermidis and Ent. cloacae). At the MIC and twice the MIC regrowth tended to occur at 24 h although this varied from strain to strain. The interaction with other antibiotics was determined by the chequerboard technique. Usually an additive or synergistic effect was observed when meropenem or imipenem was used in combination with an aminoglycoside against Gram-negative species, while in a few cases antagonism occurred in combination with beta-lactams. Against Staph, aureus, MRSA and Staph, epidermidis synergism was usually obtained with combinations with teicoplanin or vancomycin and either synergism or addition with combinations with rifampicin, co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activities of gentamicin, cefazolin, and imipenem in peritoneal dialysis fluids.
AB  - Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is an important modality of therapy for patients with renal disease. However, peritonitis continues to be a major risk factor and is usually treated by intraperitoneal administration of antimicrobial agents. Few data are available concerning the stability of antimicrobial agents in peritoneal dialysis solution beyond 48 h. Our investigation was designed to establish the chemical and biological stability of gentamicin alone and in combination with cefazolin in peritoneal dialysis solution at 6 and 72 h by an immunoassay and by an in vitro bactericidal test against American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. In addition, uninfected peritoneal dialysis effluent was inoculated with three American Type Culture Collection strains and gentamicin or imipenem. Gentamicin alone or in combination with cefazolin was not altered chemically and was bactericidal for Staphylococcus spp. but not P. aeruginosa. In contrast, imipenem was active against both Staphylococcus spp. and P. aeruginosa. Undefined factors other than inactivation of gentamicin may be responsible for the lack of bactericidal activity and treatment failure of Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics and inorganic ions in virulent bacterial strains from a hospital.
AB  - Virulent strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied for their resistance to antibiotics and inorganic ions, the correlation with their clinical use and the usefulness as an epidemioliogical tool. Multiresistance was common, the antibiotypes were similar to those previously reported, but characteristic resistotypes endemic of our county were found. A correlation between resistance and metal ion consumption was not detected. Staphylococci strains were susceptible to vancomycin, cephalothin and mercury chloride; S. epidermidis showed higher rates of resistance to antibiotics and lower to cadmium chloride and potassium iodine than S. aureus. E. coli strains were susceptible to new beta-lactamans; resistance to cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin was less than 10%. P, aeruginosa was the species with the most multiresistance and antibiotype diversity, only ceftazidime, amikacin and imipenem had a resistance rate less than 11%. In both E. coli and P. aeruginosa resistance to all tested metals (except silver nitrate) was found although with different percentages.
TI  - In vivo standardization of cutaneous bactericidal activity of antiseptics by using monoxenic hairless mice.
AB  - This study was designed to investigate the bactericidal activities of antiseptics on the cutaneous flora of hairless mice monoxenic to Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vivo. A standardized method for testing such antiseptics to compare their bactericidal effectiveness in humans in described. Seven antiseptics belonging to seven different chemical groups (iodine derivatives, alcohols, mercury compounds, quaternary ammonium salts, biguanides, phenols, and carbanilides) were used as recommended by the manufacturers (conditions of contact or prolonged contact time followed by washing with distilled water). Germfree hairless mice were infected with various bacterial strains by gastric intubation, producing levels of about 10(3) CFU/cm2 of skin. The antiseptic under test was placed on the right or left side of the ventral region. The contralateral side served as a control. In order to standardize the method, a number of crucial parameters were carefully controlled: the amount of antiseptic applied, the area of skin treated, the duration of treatment, and the washing procedure. Skin samples were obtained by cutaneous biopsy, which effectively removed all the bacteria along with the sample. The bacterial populations were counted before and after application of the antiseptic. Reductions of between 0.5 and 1.9 log units were obtained; these are comparable to those observed in humans. The standardization of our procedure and the use of animals with a strictly controlled flora eliminated much of the variability and sources of error inherent in human studies. This model could be of value for the study of resistant bacterial strains responsible for nosocomial infections and for investigations of damaged skin.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activities of Japanese green tea].
AB  - We found that extracts of Japanese green tea leaves inhibited the growth of various bacteria causing diarrheal diseases. All tea samples tested showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Vibrio cholerae O1, V. cholerae non O1. V. parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, Campylobacter jejuni and Plesiomonas shigelloides. None of the tea samples had any effect on the growth of V. fluvialis, Aeromonas sobria, A. hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae or Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella and Shigella showed susceptibilities different depending on the kind of Japanese green tea. Japanese green tea showed also bactericidal activity over S. aureus, V. parahaemolyticus and even enteropathogenic E. coli which was not sensitive when tested by cup method. The bactericidal activity was shown even at the drinking concentration in daily life.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Lytic effect of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase on gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa P3 caused lysis of freshly grown cells of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis) and Gram-negative (Proteus vulgaris and Salmonella typhi) bacteria. Heat killed and lyophilized Gram-negative bacteria showed higher sensitivity to elastase. Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were lysed maximally by elastase at pH 8.0. At this pH, the activity of elastase was maximal in Tris-HCl and glycine-NaOH buffers followed by Tris-maleate and Cacodylate buffers.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheter materials in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - Four different intravenous catheter materials, brands Teflon, Silastic, Vialon, and Tecoflex, were evaluated in vitro for bacterial adherence after 2 and 24 hours' incubation in trypticase soy broth and after 2 hours' incubation in nutrient-free phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The organisms used were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The significant differences in in vitro adherence of the different bacterial species to the various catheters were then evaluated in vivo by intravenous injection of a single bolus of 1 X 10(5) organisms via tail vein of rats with previously placed catheters in their superior venae cavae. There was no association between the in vitro bacterial adherence and the tendency of the in vivo catheters to become colonized. Results of scanning electron microscopy of clean catheters and those removed from the rats showed obvious differences in surface characteristics and in clot adhesion between the catheters. These characteristics did not correlate with bacterial adherence in vitro or colonization in vivo. It is concluded that laboratory studies of bacterial adherence to, physical characteristics of, and thrombogenicity of intravenous catheters do not necessarily translate into resistance to clinical catheter sepsis.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, QA-241.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, QA-241, 9-fluoro-6,7-dihydro-5-methyl-8(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) -1,7-dioxo-1 H,5H-benzo[ii]quinolizine-2-carboxylic hydrochloride, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. QA-241 inhibited 90% of isolates of Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. It was two-fold and four- to 16-fold less active than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. QA-241 was less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species than ciprofloxacin. Most Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 1 microgram/ml, as was that for S. epidermidis. For streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. QA-241 had minimal activity against anaerobic species. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-9) for members of the Enterobacteriaceae. However, resistant strains could be isolated by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity was less at an acid pH and in the presence of high Mg2+ concentrations. QA-241 showed a good postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli.
TI  - Lomefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone. Studies on in vitro antimicrobial spectrum,  potency, and development of resistance.
AB  - Lomefloxacin (NY-198; SC-47111), a potent new difluoroquinolone, was studied to compare its in vitro activity with that of other antimicrobials against 2194 clinical isolates. Lomefloxacin showed excellent inhibitory and bactericidal activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae and inhibited greater than 99% of the isolates at a concentration of 4 micrograms/ml or less. Lomefloxacin exhibited good-to-moderate activity against strains of Acinetobacter (MIC90 4 micrograms/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml), but poor activity for Pseudomonas cepacia (MIC90 greater than 16 micrograms/ml). Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were susceptible (MIC90 1 micrograms/ml) to lomefloxacin and the other fluoroquinolones. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae, (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml), and Branhamella catarrhalis (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.03 micrograms/ml) were highly susceptible to lomefloxacin. Streptococcal isolates, especially viridans streptococci, were considerably less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. Overall, lomefloxacin had comparable activity to norfloxacin, fleroxacin, and ofloxacin, and against many facultative anaerobes lomefloxacin was more active than imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid, aztreonam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Development of resistance to lomefloxacin by spontaneous mutation was low and comparable to that of other fluoroquinolones. Growth in subinhibitory concentrations resulted in increased resistance to fluoroquinolones for selected test strains.
TI  - [Pathogen spectrum and resistance status of infections following orthopedic operations--an evaluation of 5 years].
AB  - This study reports of 191 infections that occurred after 14807 primary clean operations from 1982 to 1986. The spectrum of organism and the resistancy of bacteria has been analysed. 5 groups of organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcen, Enterococcen and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are responsible for 82% of the infections. 88% of the bacteria in monoinfections were sensitive to Cefazedon. The development of resistancy against this type of Cefalosporin could not be seen.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - In vitro activity of lomefloxacin against multiply resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a promising new difluorinated quinolone with good antimicrobial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The in vitro activity of lomefloxacin was compared to other quinolones, expanded spectrum beta-lactams, and gentamicin. The lomefloxacin MIC90 against multiply resistant strains of P. aeruginosa was 4 mcg/ml, comparable to norfloxacin and ofloxacin. Lomefloxacin was also active against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis and JK corynebacteria. The role of lomefloxacin in the treatment of infections caused by multiresistant organisms remains to be determined in clinical trials.
TI  - [Evaluation of the treatment with oral ciprofloxacin: experience with 24 patients].
AB  - We have evaluated the clinical effectiveness and possible side effects of oral ciprofloxacin therapy in 24 patients (11 females and 13 males). Two episodes from overall 25 infections were excluded of clinical and microbiological evaluation but were assessed regarding possible side effects. In most patients, the clinical condition was stable at the beginning of therapy. Only 3 patients had nonfatal diseases. Seventeen episodes were urinary tract infections (four of them with concomitant bacteremia), four chronic osteomyelitis, and two severe soft tissue infections; 21 episodes were monomicrobial, and two polymicrobial. The isolated organisms were mostly aerobic gram negative bacilli or facultative anaerobes: E. coli (9), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Proteus mirabilis (5), Serratia marcescens (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas stutzeri (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). There were only two gram positive isolates: Staphylococcus aureus (1) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (1). The overall clinical response rate was 91%. Gastrointestinal tolerance was excellent. Colonization by Candida or Enterococcus developed in 3 cases (13%), and only one of them developed superinfection. Four patients developed several nervous system abnormalities, two increased transaminase activity and one drug exanthema. Ciprofloxacin appears as an effective drug for the monotherapy of several bacterial infections, including severe enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas infections.
TI  - [Evaluation of the effectiveness of disinfectants used in several Neapolitan hospitals].
AB  - Among the various and complex aspects concerning the etiology of nosocomial infections, a relevant role is played by the indiscriminate and incorrect use of disinfectants: they may change paradoxically from devices used for nosocomial infection prevention into carriers of infections. Critical situations are: a) inadequate cleaning of the container; b) inaccurate concentrations set up; c) use of unsterilized water as a diluent; d) introduction of gauze or cotton flocks into the container; e) disinfectant contact with inactivating substances such as soaps, detergents, and organic substances; f) solution stability; etc.. Therefore, in the light of the experience we acquired in the field of nosocomial infections, we believed interesting to carry out a study in order to detect contamination of disinfectants used in various hospitals in Naples as well as their usage. In the period from January to May 1988, 243 disinfecting solutions routinely used in surgical departments of the 2nd School of Medicine and of three large neapolitan hospitals were tested for microbiological contamination. The analysis was carried out according to Kelsey and Maurer. 13 disinfectants were contaminated. The bacterial count exceeded the value of 5000 col/ml in 6 cases, while for he other disinfectants there were levels between 2500 and 4500 col/ml. 64% of the microorganisms isolated belonged to Pseudomonas spp. (cepacia, aeruginosa, fluorescens, maltophilia), while Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were found in 21% and 15% of specimens respectively. A major consideration arising out from our study is the little attention played to health problems related to disinfection by hospital staff, together with a lack of knowledge about the proper way of using disinfectants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro activity of FCE 22101 and synergy studies with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - FCE 22101 is a penem antibiotic with broad in-vitro activity similar to that of imipenem, although less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combinations of FCE 22101 with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staph. epidermidis resulted in addition or indifference by the chequerboard method. The combination of FCE 22101 and gentamicin against Streptococcus faecalis was usually additive. Against Enterobacter cloacae FCE 22101 had MICs of 16 mg/l whilst in combination with gentamicin (0.25-0.12 mg/l) the MICs were reduced to less than 2 mg/l. Ciprofloxacin and FCE 22101 showed only addition against Enterobacter spp. similar results were obtained with the combinations of FCE 22101 and gentamicin or ciprofloxacin tested against Citrobacter freundii. With Serratia spp. FCE 22101 and gentamicin showed synergy, but FCE 22101 and ciprofloxacin showed indifference. Similar results were obtained with strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providencia spp. FCE 22101 plus gentamicin, or aztreonam, against Ps. aeruginosa usually showed indifference, but with ciprofloxacin addition was the rule. In general the combination of FCE 22101 with other agents resulted in an additive rather than a synergistic effect.
TI  - In-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of a new penem FCE 22101 was evaluated in comparison with other antimicrobial agents against 966 aerobic and anaerobic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. FCE 22101 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, H. ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis and group B streptococcus at concentrations of 0.12-4.0 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant with MIC90 of greater than 32 mg/l. Streptococcus faecalis displayed MIC90 of 16 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium spp., Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited at concentrations of 0.25-2.0 mg/l. beta-Lactamase-producing or methicillin resistant bacteria did not have significantly elevated MICs. FCE 22101 was generally less active than imipenem but more active than other beta-lactam antibiotics examined.
TI  - Comparative in vitro susceptibilities of 504 bacteremic isolates to ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A total of 504 clinical bacteremic isolates were tested for susceptibility to ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 12 other antibiotics. Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid showed superior antibacterial activity compared to penicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, and amikacin against bacteremic isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. However, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid's activity was inferior to that of vancomycin against methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus and S. epidermidis. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii, and lactose nonfermenting aerobic gram-negative bacilli, the activity of ticarcillin-clavulanic acid surpassed that of mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin. Of the antimicrobial agents tested, ticarcillin, piperacillin, ceftazidime, and amikacin were the most active antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - [The etiology of suppurative-inflammatory diseases caused by opportunistic microorganisms at the noninfectious disease clinic].
AB  - 5,853 strains of opportunistic microorganisms have been isolated from hospitalized patients at a polyclinic. The following microorganisms have been found to cause purulent inflammatory diseases most frequently: Escherichia coli (21.6%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (15.93%), Staphylococcus aureus (14.54%), microorganisms of the genus Klebsiella (11.86%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.91%) and microorganisms of the genus Proteus (7.5%). In cases of mixed infections Gram-negative bacteria prevail. The analysis of microbial species contained in the pathological excreta of patients in different departments has shown the prevalence of staphylococci in general surgery patients, E. coli in peritonitis and gynecological diseases, P. aeruginosa in patients with burns, Klebsiella, Proteus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa in patients with multiple traumatic lesions.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Urease activity of bacteria in urine].
AB  - Urea splitting bacteria are related to the formation of struvite or apatite. We investigated the urease activity of bacteria by two methods; the direct measurement of urease activity of viable bacteria and sonicated bacteria from amounts of ammonia by the indophenol method, and the measurement of urease activity by alkalization of infected urine. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had moderate activity of urease, and Morganella morganii and Staphylococcus epidermidis had the most powerful activity. P. mirabilis caused the strongest alkalization in infected urine.
TI  - Clinical overview of enoxacin.
AB  - Enoxacin is a new fluoroquinolone that will be available as oral and intravenous  preparations. This drug is bactericidal for a wide range of organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is exquisitely susceptible, as is Branhamella catarrhalis. The evaluation of the clinical activity of enoxacin is still relatively new, but published studies reveal a good deal of potential in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria in the urinary tract, upper and lower respiratory tracts, bones and joints, and the gastrointestinal tract. The general use of this drug has been associated with few adverse reactions. Further published data, as well as the results of comparative trials now in progress, will permit a thorough clinical evaluation of this useful drug.
TI  - In vitro study of the flush effect in two reusable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) disconnect systems.
AB  - Previously published in vitro results, confirmed by clinical studies, indicate that the use of a flush significantly reduces peritonitis in single-use and reusable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) systems. Since reusable systems may use the flush plus inline disinfectant between exchanges, the question remains as to whether or not the flush could be used alone in all disconnect systems. Using an in vitro model, we evaluated the flush in two reusable disconnect systems that use both flush and disinfectant in vivo. In a series of twenty sets per organism per incubation (0 h and 10 h), Y sets were inoculated in the lumen with three pure cultures (10(3) CFU range). Ability of flush without disinfectant to clear sets of contamination was analyzed by collecting multiple samples at each step of the procedure, enriching with tryptone broth and verifying bacterial growth. When contaminated sets were not incubated, flush efficacy of the systems was consistent with previous data showing 100% removal of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but only partial elimination of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After incubation, simulating reusable systems, the flush was able to eliminate S. epidermidis less than 50% of the time. There was no significant difference in results between the two systems tested. Reusable systems allow more contact time between bacteria and plastic resulting in reduced flush efficacy suggesting that, for safest conditions, they should be used with inline disinfectants.
TI  - The deconjugation ability of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the blind loop syndrome with high 14CO2 excretion--using the breath analysis technique and thin-layer chromatography.
AB  - Five patients with blind loop syndrome (Billroth II) were examined by measuring 14CO2 specific activity of expired breath samples taken at intervals after a meal containing glycine-1-14C cholate. The 5 patients tested showed a marked increase of 14CO2 specific activity. Furthermore, the ability of deconjugation of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of these patients was tested by thin layer chromatography. The bacterial species identified from the samples were as follows: enterococcus, Lactobacillus (L) buchneri, L. bifidus, L. brevis, Eubacterium (E) lentum, Bacteroides (B) vulgaricus, B. filamentosum, Corynebacterium (C) granulosum, Escherichia (E) coli, Staphylococcus (S) epidermidis, and Aerobacter (A) aerogenes. These species of bacteria, except E. coli and A. aerogenes, showed the deconjugation ability by which conjugated bile acids in ox gall was hydrolyzed. Administration of chloramphenicol (1g per day for 14 days orally divided doses) to the 5 patients reduced 14CO2 specific activity significantly. On the other hand, 9 healthy men (control subjects) who were tested showed a flat curve, and 8 of the 9 had no growth of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids. The remaining healthy man showed an overgrowth of E. coli and Pseudomonas (P) aeruginosa, but the species did not have the ability of deconjugation. Thus, we concluded that the patients with blind loop syndrome(Billroth II) had the bacterial overgrowth in the efferent loop that contained species with deconjugation ability, and, as a result the bacterial overgrowth contributed to causing abnormalities (increased deconjugation) in the metabolism of bile acids in the small intestine. When the concentration of conjugated bile acids in the small intestine was reduced to levels below the critical micellar concentration by several factors, fat malabsorption and subsequent steatorrhea were induced (1,-4). Furthermore, H. Fromm and A. F. Hofmann presented in vivo that the patients with blind loop syndrome had fat malabsorption and the patients who had a high 14CO2 output after oral administration of glycine-1-14C cholate showed a low 14CO2 output after oral administration of antibiotic drug (5,6). However, there has been no report on the deconjugation ability of bile acids of bacteria isolated from the jejunal fluids in the efferent loop of patients with Billroth II who had positive breath tests.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antagonistic action of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against Staphylococci, coliform bacilli and various types of Proteus].
AB  - Antagonistic activity of 2 fresh isolates and 3 collection strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against 177 microbial strains was determined with the method of late antagonism. Among the microbial strains there were 56 staphylococcal strains isolated from patents and carriers. 38 nontypable colon bacilli isolated from healthy persons, 59 enteropathogenic colon bacilli of various serogroups, 12 strains of Proteus and 12 colon bacilli, carriers of multiple drug resistance factors (R factors). All the cultures were sensitive to the antagonistic action of 5 or at least 3 strains of Pseudomonas used in the study. The most active antagonists were the fresh isolates of Pseudomonas as compared to the collection strains. Among the staphylococci S. aureus proved to be the most resistant to the antagonistic action of Pseudomonas as compared to S. epidermidis, the same as the strains isolated from carriers as compared to the strains isolated from patients. As for the enteric bacilli the most resistant were the strains of Proteus. Acquiring of transmissive R factors by the colon bacilli markedly increased their sensitivity to the antagonistic action of Pseudomonas.
TI  - Survival of Streptococcus viridans in gentamicin-supplemented McCarey-Kaufman medium.
AB  - Our experience with three cases of Streptococcus viridans endophthalmitis, following penetrating keratoplasty, prompted us to investigate the ability of gentamicin-supplemented McCarey-Kaufman (M-K) medium to kill S. viridans contaminants. After inoculation of 20 cc of gentamicin-supplemented M-K with S. viridans, the M-K was exposed to temperature conditions similar to those that would be encountered by a donor cornea during storage (4 degrees C) and preoperative warming prior to keratoplasty (23 degrees C). Colony counts were performed at regular intervals. After 1 h of warming, no reduction in the initial inoculum had occurred. This is in contrast to results from similar experiments with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in which more than 1 log unit of killing occurred after 1 h. While previously reported clinical experience has demonstrated an overall low incidence of postkeratoplasty endophthalmitis using gentamicin-supplemented M-K, our own recent clinical and laboratory data suggest that additional or alternate antibiotic coverage for S. viridans may be prudent.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Immunomodulation by altered gastrointestinal tract flora. The effects of orally administered, killed Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida, and Pseudomonas on systemic immune responses.
AB  - We investigated the role of microbial products from the gastrointestinal tract in the pathogenesis of immunosuppression in critical illness. Rats were gavaged daily for three weeks with killed Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida, and Pseudomonas--organisms frequently isolated from the upper gastrointestinal tract of the critically ill patient; nonspecific immunity was measured by the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. Gavage with either Pseudomonas or Candida resulted in significant suppression of DTH responses, while gavage with S epidermidis produced modest enhancement of DTH. Animals given Pseudomonas demonstrated impaired ability to localize a subcutaneous Staphylococcus aureus challenge and decreased IgM but enhanced anti-Pseudomonas IgA and IgG responses after intraperitoneal immunization. Pulmonary bacterial clearance at seven days was normal. These findings suggest that gut colonization with Candida or Pseudomonas may contribute to impairment of cell-mediated immunity in the critically ill patient.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of sulbactam/cefoperazone].
AB  - Sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) is a preparation containing CPZ and SBT, an inhibitor of beta-lactamases, at the ratio 1:1. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs and the utilization of the test in the evaluation of proper administrative doses were studied using 365 strains of clinical isolates. The antimicrobial activity of SBT/CPZ was stronger than that of CPZ alone. This increase in the antimicrobial activity due to the addition of SBT was well observed in the disc diffusion susceptibility test and MIC values. The MIC80 of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus aureus was 12.5 micrograms/ml, while that of CPZ alone was 50 micrograms/ml. MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were smaller than those of CPZ, and were 0.20, 12.5, 25 and 3.13 micrograms/ml, respectively. However, MIC80s of SBT/CPZ against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were not changed compared to those of CPZ alone, and MIC80s were 6.25, 0.20, 0.78, and 0.78 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the SBT/CPZ disc diffusion susceptibility test in the quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs prepared in this laboratory, both of which contained 30 micrograms of CPZ and 30 micrograms of SBT. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the SBT/CPZ disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of approximate MIC values. To interpret results of the Showa SBT/CPZ disc test, the following 4 category classification was used: ( inverted question mark) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark 3 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, ( inverted question mark15 micrograms/ml less than MIC less than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In both 6 and 8 mm diameter disc tests, when uniform break points of inhibitory zone diameter were similarly applied to all strains isolated clinically, some strains of S. aureus, E. faecalis, and P. aeruginosa, brought false positive (susceptible) results showing slightly greater inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs. However, if different break points against P. aeruginosa as indicated in this study were applied and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, excellent results were obtained in the quantitative estimation of MICs. Antimicrobial activities of antibiotic agents have been reported to be reduced by serum protein binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Preliminary studies on the mechanism of infection and characterization of Malassezia pachydermatis in association with canine otitis externa.
AB  - A study on the mechanism of infection and the characterization of Malassezia pachydermatis in connection with canine otitis externa was conducted. The ability of this yeast to grow uninhibited in intimate contact with the diversity of other microbial isolants of the canine aural canal was demonstrated. Canine cerumen seemed to promote the growth of this yeast. Although the source of infection is still obscure, M. pachydermatis managed to survive in soil and dust at different temperatures for four weeks. Among the commonly used diagnostic media, Sabouraud's dextrose agar was shown to be the most supportive for the growth of this yeast.
TI  - Bacterial keratitis after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be a serious problem in developing countries. The authors studied 881 patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty (total of 947 procedures) from January 1983 to March 1986 at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital, Riyadh, Saudia Arabia. All patients were followed for at least 6 months. Clinical evidence of bacterial keratitis developed in 113 (11.9%) eyes with penetrating keratoplasties in 108 patients. The causative organisms among those patients included: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 (26%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 (21%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 13 (12%); Staphylococcus aureus, 5 (4%); Hemophilus influenzae, 5 (4%); Moraxella spp, 5 (4%); alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, 5 (4%); and other bacteria, 27 (25%). In addition, postoperative epithelial defects that required hospital admission for treatment developed in 21 (2.2%) patients. Herpetic keratitis developed in three (0.3%) patients and fungal keratitis developed in 1 (0.1%). Statistically significant predisposing risk factors included: trichiasis (P less than 0.0001), epithelial defects (P less than 0.0001), soft contact lens wear (P less than 0.0001), and eroding sutures (P less than 0.0001). The authors believe that the incidence of postoperative bacterial keratitis can be minimized or avoided by appropriate selection of patients for penetrating keratoplasties as well as good preoperative and postoperative management of associated ocular conditions.
TI  - Clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  - In this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in AIDS patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). The following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: Staphylococcus aureus (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Serratia marcescens (1), Escherichia coli (1), Aeromonas hydrophila (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Salmonella cholerae-suis (1), Salmonella sp. (1), Enterobacter cloacae (1). All isolates were sensitive to the drug. Of 5 cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). The best results were obtained in patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. Two patients with salmonella bacteremia and AIDS experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. The patient with mediastinitis was successfully treated. Improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. The drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. The study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of various infections.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - Bacteremia complicating acute leukemia with special reference to its incidence and changing etiological patterns.
AB  - Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of bacteremia occurred in 132 patients with acute leukemia at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions. This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with chronic leukemia, malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma or aplastic anemia, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with all other internal diseases. The rate of occurrence of bacteremia, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period. The frequency of gram-negative bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency. The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of nosocomial infection. On the other hand, the frequency of gram-positive cocci increased from 9 to 36%. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens. Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation cephalosporins and central venous catheters. It is thus suggested that vancomycin be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when gram-positive infections are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in infection prevention.
TI  - [Clinical examination of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor on chronic respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of S 6472 (sustained release preparations of cefaclor), a granule form of cefaclor, was performed in 20 patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The patients subjected to the study consisted of 11 males and 9 females with ages between 44 and 76 years. S 6472 was given orally to each patient in a daily dose of 750 mg in 2 divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 days in 1 case, 7 days in 11 cases, 11 days in 3 cases and 14 days in 5 cases. A total of 5 strains including 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified from sputum samples before the administration of the drug. All strains were eradicated but, instead 2 strains, 1 strain each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared after the therapy. The clinical efficacy rate was 95.0% (19/20): Excellent in 5 cases, good in 14 cases and fair in 1 case. No side effects were observed, but eosinophilia was observed in 1 case. From the above results, it appeared that S 6472 was effective, safe and useful agent for the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Surgical service nosocomial infections at a Veterans Administration medical center.
AB  - Nosocomial surgical infections at a Veterans Administration medical center were monitored from February 1986 to June 1987 (17 months). Three hundred twenty-four patients had 508 nosocomial infections, including 66 patients in whom cultures were not performed. The remaining 258 patients had 584 microorganisms, including gram-negative bacilli (56.8 percent), gram-positive cocci (33.6 percent), and yeasts (8.4 percent). The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, group D enterococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were similar for nosocomial and all hospital isolates combined 84.5 percent of the time; all hospital isolates combined were more resistant in 5.5 percent and nosocomial isolates in 10.0 percent. The infection rate for surgical wounds was only 2.5 percent. When all nosocomial infection sites were compared, however, the rate for lower respiratory tract and some other infections appeared high and disproportionate. The significance of this finding is questionable because of a lack of comparable published reports from other Veterans Administration medical centers. The importance of patient population at risk of obtaining some nosocomial infections (especially lower respiratory) may be greater in adult men than in other patient populations.
TI  - Bacterial challenge study of a porous carbon percutaneous implant.
AB  - Numerous percutaneous devices for power transmission and control to electrically  powered, intracorporeal blood pumps have been used for periods ranging from 12 months to 4 yrs; however, consistent and reliable performance has not been achieved, due most frequently to the development of infection and sinus tracts at the percutaneous lead exit site. The present study showed that percutaneous devices fabricated from porous vitreous carbon can function satisfactorily in vivo over extended periods. The implant sites successfully resisted infection by normal flora bacteria for as long as 48 months, although superficial surface colonization and infection did occur after deliberate application of pathogens.
TI  - [The microbial factor in the chemiluminescence of the peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with suppurative surgical infection].
AB  - The luminol-dependent chemiluminescence of neutrophils in the peripheral blood of 30 healthy adults and 39 patients with the local and generalized forms of purulent infection was studied. Nonstimulated chemiluminescence and the index of chemiluminescence stimulation in the presence of opsonized Staphylococcus aureus added in vitro were determined. The former characteristic was found to be directly and the latter one, inversely related to the concentration of S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans, but not E. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Citrobacter, in the primary focus. At the microbial concentration exceeding 10(4) cells/g of tissue, the former characteristic was essentially higher than the level of chemiluminescence in healthy persons. With the improvement of the general state of the patients and in the absence of microorganisms in the wound as the result of complex treatment this characteristic decreased to values comparable with the reaction of neutrophils in healthy persons.
TI  - L-656,575 (OCP-9-176): a novel oxacephem. In vitro activity against aerobic and anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - L-656,575 (OCP-9-176) is a novel oxacephem superior to ceftazidime in in vitro activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter species, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and multiply-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our results suggest that L-656,575 has a high affinity for penicillin binding proteins of Pseudomonas and may bind preferentially to PBP-3 in this organism. L-656,575 is active against beta-lactamase derepressed Enterobacteriaceae and ceftazidime-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Therapy of acute and chronic gram-negative osteomyelitis with ciprofloxacin. Report from a Swedish Study Group.
AB  - Oral ciprofloxacin was used at doses ranging from 500 mg to 1500 mg twice daily for 15 to 476 (mean 139) days for treatment of acute or chronic osteomyelitis in 38 patients, and acute arthritis in two. Clinical efficacy could be evaluated in 34 patients; 22 had resolution of their osteomyelitis, five improved and there were seven failures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the causative agent in 28 patients. It was eradicated in 22 patients, persisted but remained sensitive to ciprofloxacin in three and persisted with emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin in three. Nineteen other pathogens, five Gram-negative and 14 Gram-positive, were isolated. Of those, one strain of Staphylococcus aureus, two of Staph. epidermidis and three of Streptococcus faecalis remained sensitive to ciprofloxacin during treatment. In one patient, Slr. faecalis persisted with emergence of resistance to ciprofloxacin. Ten adverse events related to ciprofloxacin treatment were observed in nine patients; two phototoxic reactions, two cases of impaired colour vision, and one each of exanthema, abdominal pain, malaise, drug fever, peripheral neuropathy and eosinophilia. In three patients the adverse events led to treatment discontinuation. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin seems to offer an oral alternative to injectible antibiotics in patients with osteomyelitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including Ps. aeruginosa.
TI  - Enhanced bacterial adhesion on surfaces pretreated with fibrinogen and fibronectin.
AB  - The effect of certain plasma proteins on the adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis on polyurethane, polyvinylchloride, or glass was investigated. Test surfaces were treated with serum, plasma, albumin, immunoglobulin G, fibrinogen, or fibronectin. Using a specially designed test chamber, surfaces previously treated with test proteins were incubated with bacterial suspension. During the experiment, the test chamber was placed on a rotator to prevent settling of bacteria. At the end of the experiment, each test well was rinsed repeatedly to remove non-adherent bacteria. The number of bacteria adherent to the test surfaces was quantitated by a combination of methods including microscopic counting of cells, scintillation counting and autoradiography. It was noted that a greater number of bacteria adhered to surfaces coated with fibrinogen or fibronectin whereas surfaces treated with serum showed reduced bacterial adhesion. The inhibitory effect of serum appeared more pronounced with S. epidermidis when compared with P. aeruginosa under identical experimental conditions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that adherent bacteria were randomly distributed on the test surfaces and appeared to replicate while still adherent. These observations suggested that bacterial adhesion to biomaterials can be significantly influenced by the composition of the adsorbed proteins at the interface.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin activity in cyst fluid from polycystic kidneys.
AB  - Renal cyst infection in patients with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is often unresponsive to standard antimicrobial therapy, in part because of the failure of most antibiotics to adequately penetrate cyst fluid. Ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antibiotic, possesses in vitro activity against most pathogens likely to be encountered in renal cyst infection. To study the potential usefulness of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of cyst infection, fluid from 70 cysts was obtained from seven patients with polycystic kidney disease who were receiving the drug. Cysts were categorized as nongradient or gradient by the sodium concentration in the fluid. The ciprofloxacin concentration within cysts was measured, and the cyst fluid bactericidal activity against likely cyst fluid pathogens was determined. The mean (+/- standard error) ciprofloxacin concentration was 12.7 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml. Preferential accumulation of ciprofloxacin occurred in gradient cysts; these levels exceeded levels in serum by more than fourfold. Cyst fluid bactericidal activity titers were uniformly high against Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis, while less activity was observed against Streptococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Evolution of beta-lactamase inhibitors.
AB  - Beta-lactamase, the bacterial enzyme that can inactivate penicillins, cephalosporins and related antibiotics, can function outside the cell or in the periplasmic space. This resistance can be transferred between bacteria of the same or different species. Most strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides species are beta-lactamase producers. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that works by blocking the enzyme center. When it is combined with amoxicillin and ticarcillin, it expands those drugs' spectrum of activity to bacteria that are resistant to the single antibiotics as well as to anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - In-vitro microbiological activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, novel synthetic oxazolidinones.
AB  - DuP 105 and 721, synthetic antibiotics belonging to a totally novel chemical class (oxazolidinones), have been found to be active in vitro against a wide range of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. DuP 721 had geometric mean MICs ranging from 1.1 to 16 mg/l against 167 strains of Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. saprophyticus, streptococci of Groups A, B and D and diphtheroids. DuP 105 was between 1.5 and eight-fold less active. Bacteroides fragilis strains were also susceptible to the DuP compounds (mean MICs being 8.3 and 14.9 mg/l for DuP 721 and 105, respectively), but other Gram-negative species and yeasts were not inhibited by concentrations in excess of 100 mg/l. Both compounds had a predominantly bacteriostatic action. No primary resistance was found, and the incidence of resistant variants in 105 strains tested was less than 1 per 10(8) bacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, T-3262 (A-60969).
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, T-3262 [A-60969; DL-7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1-, 4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, ceftazidime, imipenem, and gentamicin. T-3262 inhibited 90% of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was two to four times more active than ofloxacin and similarly or slightly less active than ciprofloxacin. Ninety percent of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited at 0.5 micrograms/ml. It was 4- to 8-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 8- to 16-fold more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas cepacia and Pseudomonas maltophilia, which were resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml. The MIC for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, was 0.12 micrograms/ml; that for Staphylococcus epidermidis was 0.5 micrograms/ml, as was that for Enterococcus faecalis. It inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 2 micrograms/ml, considerably more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. The frequency of spontaneous point mutational resistance was less than 10(-10) for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp. Resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculture. Similar to other quinolones, its activity could be affected by culture conditions. T-3262 showed a postantibiotic suppressive effect on Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus.
TI  - [Treatment of peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with intraperitoneal ceftriaxone].
AB  - In 16 patients under CAPD, 29 cases of bacterial peritonitis were observed, with  clinical manifestations in 23. The mean cell count in peritoneal dialysis fluid was 5608/mm3 with 4991/mm3 polymorphonuclear, Leukocytes Causative pathogens were Staphylococcus in 14 cases, Streptococcus in 6, Bacillus in one, Enterobacteria in 5, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 and Moraxella in 1. Three cultures were negative. First choice treatment was a daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 g of ceftriaxone. 79.3% of patients recovered within 5 days. Failure were due to a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, a Streptococcus faecalis in two cases, and a Staphylococcus aureus in three observations, which two were responsible of abscess round catheter peritoneal. Mean ceftriaxone concentrations 24 hours after the intraperitoneal injection were 50.6 mg/l (range: 3.3-141 mg/l) in serum and 58.1 mg/l (range: 4.3-180 mg/l) in dialysate. These concentrations are greater than most of ceftriaxone's MICs for susceptible bacteria, a finding that confirm the value of treatment with a single daily intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone.
TI  - In vitro activities of two oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, DuP 721 and DuP 105.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of DuP 105 and DuP 721, new oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, were compared with those of beta-lactams and glycopeptides. Ninety percent of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates, including methicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 4 micrograms of DuP 105 and 1 microgram of DuP 721 per ml. DuP 721 inhibited hemolytic streptococcus groups A, B, C, F, and G at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, and it inhibited viridans group streptococci at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium group JK species, anaerobic cocci, and Clostridium spp. including Clostridium difficile. They did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the MIC for 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates was 8 micrograms of DuP 721 per ml.
TI  - Microbiology of indwelling central intravascular catheters.
AB  - Indwelling central-line catheters (n = 502) from 362 patients in intensive care units were analyzed prospectively. The skin site, 6-cm-distal and -proximal subcutaneous segments of the catheter, exudates, and blood were cultured. Semiqualitative roll plate cultures of the catheter segments were followed by broth cultures and examined for 72 h. All isolates were identified, and susceptibilities were determined. Line infections, defined clinically, yielded 22 different microbial species; 10 different species were recovered from colonized lines. Of the Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates recovered, 39% occurred singly and 21% occurred in combination with other microorganisms; Enterococcus faecalis, S. hominis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were next in frequency of isolation. Line infections also yielded other staphylococci, viridans group streptococci, several members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacters, anaerobic bacteria, Candida spp., and Aspergillus fumigatus. While S. epidermidis was also the most frequent isolate among the line colonizers, different species and different frequencies of isolation were found among this group. The study showed that the distal catheter segment broth culture was the best predictor of clinical line infections; in addition, gram-negative bacteria were isolated only from the catheters of patients with overt infections.
TI  - Infectious complications in four long-term recipients of the Jarvik-7 artificial  heart.
AB  - This article describes the infectious complications that occurred among four of the longest-term recipients of the Jarvik-7 artificial heart. Infection arising from the drive lines, with spread to the mediastinal periprosthetic space, was the major limiting factor in long-term use of the device in these patients. Periprosthetic infections were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species. Other infectious complications incurred by some of the patients included pneumonia, empyema, urinary tract infection, and intravascular line sepsis with Candida. Intensive antimicrobial therapy for prolonged periods seemed to suppress but not to eradicate infection and was accompanied by the appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. Complications of antimicrobial therapy included diarrhea secondary to overgrowth with Clostridium difficile in two patients. Use of the current device for more than 30 days should be considered extraordinary and should be reserved for patients for whom no other form of life support is available.
TI  - Postmortem microbiological findings of two total artificial heart recipients.
AB  - This report describes the postmortem microbiological findings and related gross pathology from two patients who had the longest survival after implantation of the Jarvik-7-100 total artificial heart. We documented extensive polymicrobial colonization at the site of the device and adjacent structures; however, the internal drive lines were remarkably free of bacterial colonization despite evidence of infection at the skin junction and in close proximity to the artificial heart. The polyurethane polymer (Biomer) on the external surface of the device was discolored and pitted in appearance and the Velcro material that attaches the two ventricles together was eroded. A nonspecific mass of tissue that was adherent to the device and to portions of the drive lines contained inflammatory cells, fibrinous debris, and colonies of microorganisms.
TI  - Candida albicans infection of a prosthetic knee replacement: a report and review  of the literature.
AB  - A woman with rheumatoid arthritis who underwent total knee arthroplasty is described. The implant became infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis and she received a prolonged course of postoperative antistaphylococcal antibiotics. Four months postoperatively she developed a calf ulcer that grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa and required further antibiotic therapy. One year later she presented with a painful, swollen knee with radiographic findings suggesting loosening of the prosthetic knee implant. Arthrocentesis cultures grew Candida albicans. She was treated with arthrodesis, amphotericin B, 5-fluorocytosine, and ketoconazole and remains free of infection 21 months after removal of the prosthesis. The clinical course of 6 other cases of Candida prosthetic joint infections is reviewed.
TI  - In vitro activity of temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Temafloxacin, a new difluoro quinolone, inhibited the majority of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. It was 4-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin and 2-fold less active than ofloxacin. Cefotaxime and imipenem-resistant isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited. Temafloxacin inhibited Neisseria, Branhamella, and Haemophilus species at less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Clostridium spp. were inhibited at concentrations less or equal to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to intravenous cannulae: influence of implantation in the rabbit and of enzyme treatments.
AB  - Comparison was made of the adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six types of intravascular cannula material. Adhesion to materials removed from rabbit tissues did not differ significantly between types of material or between bacterial species. In contrast, major differences were found when unimplanted materials were examined; the overall rank order of adhesiveness of bacteria to unimplanted materials (S. epidermidis greater than P. aeruginosa greater than S. aureus much greater than K. aerogenes greater than E. coli) was highly significant (F = 13.0, P less than 0.0005), and although no single material was consistently least attractive to all micro-organisms, FEP-Teflon and PTFE-Teflon showed significantly lower overall affinity for bacteria than other materials (P less than 0.001); all species showed a significant preference for a silicone polymer (P less than 0.0005). The nature of the bacterial surface structures responsible for adhesion were investigated by the actions of pronase and mixed glycosidase, which produced significant respective decreases and increases in adhesion of staphylococci to unimplanted materials; their effects on the Gram-negative bacilli were less consistent.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of single-dose ceftizoxime vs. multiple-dose cefoxitin in preventing infection after vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - The efficacy, safety and effect of a single, 1-g dose of ceftizoxime on the return of vaginal flora were compared to those of the standard regimen of three 2-g doses of cefoxitin for prophylaxis in 99 randomized women undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. Thirty-four were studied in Dallas and 65 in Los Angeles. Surgical procedures were comparable for all the antibiotic groups, although proportionately more simple hysterectomies were performed in Dallas. The patients received a povidone-iodine vaginal preparation immediately before surgery; vaginal packs, when used, contained no antimicrobial agents. Primary prophylactic failure (operative site infection) occurred in 1 of 52 (1.9%) and 4 of 47 (8.5%) of the ceftizoxime- and cefoxitin-treated patients, respectively, for a nonsignificant difference. All five primary prophylactic failures occurred in the Los Angeles patients. One patient in each antibiotic group developed a urinary tract infection and was classified as a secondary prophylactic failure. Febrile morbidity, length of hospital stay and incidence of adverse effects did not differ by antibiotic. The enterococcus was commonly found in the postoperative vaginal flora and was of no value in predicting operative-site infection. Enterobacter species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated more commonly in patients who received cefoxitin. Diphtheroids, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Peptostreptococcus species were isolated more commonly in patients treated with ceftizoxime.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia in a large Spanish teaching hospital: analysis of factors influencing prognosis.
AB  - Five hundred forty-three episodes of nosocomial bacteremia were prospectively followed in a large Spanish university hospital. The commonest isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida species. The most frequent sources of infection were intravenous lines, urinary tract, and lower respiratory tract. Overall mortality was 18%. A step-forward logistic regression analysis defined eight variables independently influencing the outcome: shock, underlying rapidly fatal disease, high-risk source of bacteremia (intraabdominal, lower respiratory tract, or not identified), age more than 70 years, hospitalization in intensive care or medical units, inappropriate antibiotic treatment, infection due to a high-risk microorganism (P. aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, or Candida), and development of septic metastasis. The identification of those factors independently influencing the outcome and their possible modification may represent a further step in the control of nosocomial bacteremia by improving its prognosis.
TI  - Phototoxicity of skin microorganisms tested with a new model.
AB  - A new standardized method for testing phototoxicity of chemicals against microorganisms is described. The inoculum size of the microorganism, application of test chemicals, prediffusion time, incubation time and incubation period are defined. Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Pityrosporum orbiculare were studied. Both 8-methoxypsoralen and trimethylpsoralen were phototoxic against all microorganisms tested, while tetracycline and doxycycline were not phototoxic. C. albicans may be chosen for phototoxicity testing because it has been used earlier, it is easy to maintain in culture, it grows easily when tested, and its pathogenicity is low. The phototoxicity of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Propionibacterium acnes, C. albicans, and P. orbiculare against each other were also investigated. Only P. orbiculare was inhibitory. It inhibited the growth of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Ps. aeruginosa - both in the dark and after irradiation. The growth inhibition was markedly enhanced after UVA irradiation, indicating phototoxicity. The phototoxic effect of P. orbiculare may play a role in the ecology of the human skin flora.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators on bacterial growth in human serum.
AB  - The effect of synthetic iron chelators of the 1-alkyl-3-hydroxy-2-methylpyrid-4-one class (the L1 series) and 1-hydroxypyrid-2-one (L4) on bacterial growth in human serum was compared with those of the plant iron chelators mimosine and maltol and of the microbial siderophore desferrioxamine. None of the synthetic chelators enhanced growth of 3 Gram-negative organisms (Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa); in some cases they were even inhibitory. L4 strongly stimulated growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, but the L1 series had only a marginal effect. Maltol was mildly inhibitory to all 4 bacterial species, while mimosine enhanced the growth of S. epidermidis and Y. enterocolitica but had little effect on E. coli or P. aeruginosa. Desferrioxamine enhanced the growth of all except E. coli. These results suggest that the chelators of synthetic or plant origin may carry less risk of increasing susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients undergoing chelation therapy for iron overload than does desferrioxamine, the drug currently in clinical use.
TI  - Microbiologic and therapeutic aspects of Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent (28.8%) gram-positive organism in 149 cystic fibrosis patients. Next to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus was the most persistent bacterial pathogen as well. Persistence was not correlated to the age or sex of our patients. Colonization by S. aureus was not prevented completely by oral antibiotics like cotrimoxazole or oral cephalosporins. Persisting staphylococci were less susceptible to the antibiotic substances used than strains detectable only sporadically. Increase of sputum concentrations of P. aeruginosa was observed in episodes of treatment with purely antistaphylococcal compounds. Improvement of effectiveness of antibacterial therapy may be achievable by antibiotics more active against staphylococci, active both against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa, or adequate drug combinations.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro studies of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240), a new trifluorinated quinolone derivative.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro 23-6240) against 441 bacterial isolates was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, amoxycillin, cefadroxil, cefuroxime and tobramycin. An agar dilution method was used for the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Ciprofloxacin showed the highest activity against the Enterobacteriaceae, 95% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.06 mg/l, but fleroxacin and ofloxacin were also highly active (MIC 90% = 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). Ciprofloxacin was the most active agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 90% = 0.12 mg/l), whereas the activities of fleroxacin and ofloxacin were more variable. Tobramycin was highly active against P. aeruginosa, 75% of the isolates were inhibited by 0.5 mg/l or less. The quinolones and tobramycin exhibited high activity against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the great majority of the isolates being susceptible to 0.5 mg/l or less of any agent. All the quinolones showed high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but fleroxacin was less active against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus than were the other derivatives. The pneumococcal and streptococcal isolates were markedly less susceptible to fleroxacin than to the other quinolones tested (MIC range 4-32 mg/l). All isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by the lowest concentration of the quinolones employed in the study (0.03 mg/l). Cefuroxime was also highly active against N. gonorrhoeae, whether the strains were beta-lactamase-producing or not, but was somewhat less active against H. influenzae. The quinolones displayed moderate and similar activity against Bacteroides fragilis isolates (MIC range 1-16 mg/l). The MICs of fleroxacin against gram-negative rods were generally 4-16 times higher at pH 8.8 than those obtained at pH 5.8 and 7.3. The activity against gram-positive cocci was not markedly influenced by changes in pH.
TI  - The role of infection in the premature baboon with lung injury.
AB  
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Ofloxacin for prevention of bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients.
AB  - We studied the potential value of oral ofloxacin (200 mg twice daily) for selective decontamination and infection prevention in 40 granulocytopenic patients with acute leukemia, blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, hairy cell leukemia or severe aplastic anemia. The quality of selective decontamination was acceptable with rapid elimination of Enterobacteriaceae from the alimentary tract, only a slight decrease in concentrations of anaerobes in faeces, and a small number of newly acquired transient (twelve isolates in seven patients) or colonizing (six strains with 28 isolates in four patients) aerobic gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus (one isolate) recovered from 672 surveillance cultures from faeces, oral washings and urine. Two of three patients colonized with ofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains developed Pseudomonas infections. A total of twelve acquired infections was observed. Six were microbiologically documented infections, all caused by ofloxacin-resistant bacteria (two P. aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Aerococcus viridans, one Micrococcus sp.). Tolerance was acceptable with no serious side effects observed. Mean drug concentrations in serum and saliva were comparable to those determined in healthy volunteers and were found to be higher in saliva than in serum. We conclude that ofloxacin may be studied as an effective alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for selective decontamination and infection prevention in severely granulocytopenic patients. Careful monitoring of colonizing Pseudomonas spp. with decreased ofloxacin sensitivity, however, seems necessary.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating the effective administrative dose of latamoxef. Significance of a 4-category system interpretation of the latamoxef disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of latamoxef (LMOX) against 249 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. LMOX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis (except 2 out of 30 strains) and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 3.13 micrograms/ml. It was also active against Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC80 of 1.56 micrograms/ml. LMOX was less active against Serratia marcescens, inhibiting about 43% of strains at a level of 6.25 micrograms/ml. It was also less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing MIC80 of 12.5 and 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. LMOX was not active against Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The reliability of the LMOX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Difco), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of LMOX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the LMOX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of LMOX. For the interpretation of LMOX disc test results, if uniform break points of zone diameters were used to test all bacteria, inhibitory zone diameters of Showa discs used on Staphylococcus were relatively large compared to MICs determined, probably due to decarboxylation of LMOX sodium salt in the discs. However, those of Difco discs were not, because Difco discs use LMOX ammonium salt. Both discs also showed relatively large inhibitory zone diameters compared to MICs determined against P. aeruginosa. Using different break points from those used for other bacteria to interpret inhibition zones for Staphylococcus and P. aeruginosa, these disc susceptivility tests should be useful to estimate approximate MICs. A 3 category system for the interpretation of disc test results has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: Resistant (R) MIC greater than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml, intermediate (I) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. The 4 category system uses break points as follows: MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - SIGNAL blood culture system for detection of bacteremia in neonates.
AB  - In the SIGNAL (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) blood culture system, gas produced by bacterial metabolism displaces medium from the culture bottle into an upper reservoir via a hollow needle. Displacement of media may provide a visual indication of the presence of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms in a single medium. The single-bottle SIGNAL system was compared with paired BACTEC 16B and 7D (Johnston Laboratories, Inc., Towson, Md.) radiometric system bottles by using bacterial inocula and conditions which simulated those found in neonatal and pediatric populations. The single SIGNAL bottle was a good as the combined BACTEC media for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, but was slower for Candida spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group B streptococci, alpha-streptococci, and pneumococci. The SIGNAL system failed to detect four of five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis and four of eight anaerobic organisms. The SIGNAL system is not suitable for neonatal blood cultures at its present state of development.
TI  - The value of prophylactic antibiotics during the insertion of long-term indwelling silastic right atrial catheters in cancer patients.
AB  - Over a 3.5 year period from August 1982 to December 1985, 200 Hickman catheters (Evermed, Medina, WA) were inserted into patients at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSHRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. One hundred sixty catheters were placed in patients with malignant disease, many of whom were immunosuppressed at the time of catheter insertion. Seventy of 160 (44%) patients received prophylactic antibiotics and 90 (56%) did not. The mean age of each group was 23 years (range, 2 to 70 years), and the patients in each group were statistically similar in sex, underlying disease, and routine preoperative hematologic and biochemical evaluation. Exit-site wound infections occurred in 50 of 90 (55.5%) patients who did not receive prophylaxis and in 12 of 70 (17%) patients who received prophylaxis (P less than 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tunnel and incision site infections. The mean duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 2.9 days (SD, 1.2 days). Organisms cultured from catheter associated infections, included Staphylococcus epidermidis 36, S. aureus 30, Klebsiella pneumoniae 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, Escherichia coli 1, and diphtheroids non-CDC-JK 3. Vancomycin was used as antibiotic prophylaxis in 64 patients, Kefzol (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) in one, oxacillin in three, nafcillin in one, and Septra (Burroughs Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, NC) in one. The data indicate that the use of intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces exit site infection and may reduce both tunnel and incision site infection. Prophylactic antibiotic coverage should be provided to patients during insertion of long-term indwelling right atrial catheters.
TI  - Microbiology of acute periodontal infection in myelosuppressed cancer patients.
AB  - This study characterized the subgingival microbial flora associated with 27 acute exacerbations of preexistent periodontal disease in 24 patients with chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. All but two acute periodontal infections developed at low granulocyte levels (less than 1,000/microL). Suspected pathogens were detected in high concentrations in subgingival plaque specimens in 17 episodes of acute periodontal infection; a single pathogen was recovered in ten acute infections, and more than one pathogen was recovered in seven acute infections. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, S aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa predominated, with combinations of these detected in some patients. Concomitant bacteremias developed in two of these patients. The subgingival microflora associated with ten acute periodontal infections was characterized by predominantly indigenous microorganisms, which in nine episodes were in abnormal proportions compared with microbial profiles in noncancer patients with similar degrees of periodontal disease. These data demonstrate that pathogens normally associated with infections in myelosuppressed cancer patients, as well as indigenous oral flora, are associated with acute periodontal infections during granulocytopenia. This finding is important, since this body site has not commonly been recognized as a source for acute infection in these patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new penem antimicrobial agent, CGP 31608, was compared with those of imipenem, SCH 34343, and several other antimicrobial agents against approximately 600 bacterial isolates. CGP 31608 was active against gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC for 90% of the isolates [MIC90], 0.25 microgram/ml) and penicillin-susceptible streptococci (MIC90s, less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml). Penicillin-resistant streptococci (including enterococci) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus were more resistant to the penem. Activities of CGP 31608 against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were remarkably uniform, with MIC90s of 8 to 16 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was at least as active as imipenem and ceftazidime and more active than piperacillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Drug activity was not influenced by the presence of any of 10 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases. Against strains of Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and P. aeruginosa with derepressible chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, the presence of cefoxitin did not induce increased resistance to CGP 31608. The new drug was also active against anaerobes (MIC90s, 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/ml), and Legionella spp. (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml). CGP 31608 showed an antibacterial spectrum similar to those of imipenem and SCH 34343 (except that the latter is not active against P. aeruginosa) but was generally less potent than these drugs. However, CGP 31608 demonstrated more activity (MIC90) than imipenem against P. aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-807, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - CS-807 is a new oral prodrug of R-3746, a cephalosporin derivative, with potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa of 102 patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - A microbiological analysis of 102 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis was conducted over a 22 month period. 20 microbial species with the following incidence were identified: Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 83.4%; Candida albicans: 29.4%; Staphylococcus aureus: 24.5%; Staphylococcus epidermidis: 11.8%; Haemophilus influenzae: 11.8%; Streptococcus pneumoniae; 6.9%; Pseudomonas maltophilia: 6.8%; Aspergillus fumigatus: 5.9%. Other species were present in less than 5% of the patients. In the majority of specimens with P. aeruginosa, more than one type (up to six) was detectable. These strains were identical in colony appearance, O-serotype and pyocin-type. Quantitative analysis revealed concentrations of colony-forming units of 10(7) to 10(9) for P. aeruginosa, 10(6) to 10(8) for P. maltophilia, 10(4) to 10(7) for S. aureus, 10(4) to 10(6) for S. epidermidis and 10(4) to 10(7) for C. albicans in the majority of specimens. Significant differences were observed in the time periods during which the pathogens persisted in the patients. Maximum persistence was observed for P. aeruginosa. P. maltophilia and A. fumigatus had about similar persistence rates, which were lower than those for P. aeruginosa but above those for S. aureus and H. influenzae. S. epidermidis was eliminated within shorter periods than S. aureus. C. albicans, although the second most frequent microorganism identified, showed a very low persistence rate. The microbiological analysis confirms results from other research centers (high incidence of P. aeruginosa), but reveals significant regional differences as well (Pseudomonas cepacia not detectable, higher incidence of P. maltophilia and C. albicans). This underlines the necessity for detailed qualitative and quantitative microbiological analysis of sputa from cystic fibrosis patients as a prerequisite for rational analysis of etiological, epidemiological and therapeutical aspects of cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - The growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing glucose, amino acids, and lipid emulsion in one container and amino acid/dextrose solutions [conventional total parenteral nutrition (TPN) formulations] were studied in a controlled laboratory experiment for their ability to support the growth of microorganisms. Both TNA and conventional TPN formulations for peripheral and central venous administration with standard additives were inoculated with microorganisms to provide 10(1)-10(2) colony-forming units/ml (CFU/ml) of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. The admixtures were stored at room temperature and samples for quantitative microbiology were taken at time 0, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hr. K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were able to proliferate in central TNAs, but the growth of these organisms was retarded in conventional TPN solutions. In the peripheral formulations, K. pneumoniae and E. coli proliferated in both the TNA and conventional TPN systems, whereas P. aeruginosa grew well only in the peripheral TNA. S. epidermidis was not able to grow in any admixtures tested; however, C. albicans grew well in all admixtures, but growth was slower in the conventional central TPN. In conclusion, peripheral and central TNAs supported the growth of microorganisms significantly better than conventional TPN solutions.
TI  - In vitro correlation of platelet aggregation with occurrence of disseminated intravascular coagulation and subacute bacterial endocarditis.
AB  - Platelet-bacterial interactions were examined in vitro by incubating organisms isolated from patients with septicemia with normal platelet-rich plasma. The potency of various species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to induce irreversible platelet aggregation was then determined in an aggregometer. The aggregation curves produced by the bacteria resembled the normal platelet response to collagen and were impeded by the presence of aspirin. Strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from 25 different patients produced maximum increases in light transmission and irreversible platelet aggregation with relatively rapid mean aggregation times; six of these patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In contrast, isolates of alpha streptococcus and Staphylococcus epidermidis induced irreversible platelet aggregation much less commonly and were associated with considerably longer mean aggregation times. None of the latter group of patients had evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Isolates of bacteria from a small number of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis uniformly induced irreversible platelet aggregation. Addition of paired bacterial isolates to normal platelet-rich plasma demonstrated a synergistic aggregation response. These data suggest that a relative hierarchy exists in bacterial strain potency to induce irreversible platelet aggregation. The rapidity and degree of aggregation in vitro correlated well with the clinical and laboratory evidence for subacute bacterial endocarditis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in vivo. These observations may provide useful adjunctive laboratory information to help establish the diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis, especially in the clinical setting where the classical findings of endocarditis are not obvious during initial presentation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome (HR 810), a new cephalosporin antibiotic having a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain, was compared with in vitro activities of 5 other cephalosporins. HR 810 showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria when tested using 71 standard strains and 876 clinical isolates. HR 810 inhibited 70% of the clinically isolated Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains when used at 0.59-0.84 microgram/ml, 2- to 25-fold lower than values of reference antibiotics, and the compound was also highly effective against Enterococcus faecalis which is relatively resistant to most of the existing cephem antibiotics. The activity of HR 810 against Enterobacteriaceae members (11 species), based on its minimal inhibitory concentrations inhibiting 90% of bacterial growth (MIC90S), was the highest among the cephalosporins used. Especially against Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, the MIC90S of the compound were 4- to 64-fold lower than the values of the other antibiotics. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, HR 810 was as active as cefoperazone, an antipseudomonal agent. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of HR 810 were equal to or only 2-fold greater than the MICs for most of 12 standard strains tested. The compound markedly decreased viable bacterial counts at its MICs, thus showing strong bactericidal activities. The in vitro activity of HR 810 was not affected by pH or human serum content of agar media, but the activity against Gram-negative bacteria was lowered as the inoculum size increased.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - [Bone infections: treatment by ofloxacin. Apropos of 10 cases].
AB  - Because of its pharmacokinetic, broad spectrum and oral administration, ofloxacin can be used in the treatment of chronic bone infections. A clinical trial was performed in 10 patients with subacute or chronic osteitis (5 Staphylococcus aureus, 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Patients were given orally 200 mg 12 hourly. Treatment duration went on from 2 to 6 months. In this trial, the evaluation was successful in the 10 cases with a delay of 2 to 13 months (m 8,9) after the end of the treatment. Prosthetic material has been taken off in 1 case out of 4 patients (prosthetic hip) because of persistaet free bacteria outflow. For one patient, a superinfection with a Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin was noticed at the second month. Bone levels (microbiological method) were between 1,3 and 9,7 mg/l and always higher to the MIC of the bacteria. Biological tolerance was satisfactory in spite of a rise of transaminase level, a transient renal disfunction whom relationship to the treatment was difficult. 3 transient photosensitivities were also noticed.
TI  - Transport, nutritional and metabolic studies of taurine in staphylococci.
AB  - A specific, Na+-dependent, energy-requiring transport system for taurine has been reported recently in the Staphylococcus aureus M strain. Taurine was taken up vigorously by all S. aureus strains tested. The system was Na+-dependent, and Na+ decreased the Km but had no effect on the Vmax of the transport system. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, the Staphylococcus epidermidis group (a taxonomically related group of species associated with humans or other primates) and the free-living, wide-ranging species Staphylococcus sciuri showed vigorous taurine uptake. Somewhat lower rates were found in the Staphylococcus saprophyticus group. Low or barely detectable uptake rates were noted in other staphylococcal species that were primarily of animal origin. No taurine uptake was detected in a variety of other bacterial species tested. Taurine uptake, which was not Na+-dependent, occurred in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain grown on taurine as sole energy, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur source, but not when it was grown in a gluconate/salts medium. In nutritional studies we were unable to demonstrate a role for taurine as a sulphur source for S. aureus. [1,2-14C]- and [35S]taurine were taken up during overnight growth of cells, and radioactivity was distributed similarly among cellular fractions, indicating that the carbon and sulphur atoms of taurine were not cleaved and had the same fate. We were unable to demonstrate any catabolism of taurine in radiorespirometric experiments to detect evolution of 14CO2 by cells incubated with [1,2-14C]taurine. Thus, we found no evidence for a role of taurine in the energy, carbon and sulphur metabolism of S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of ceftizoxime. Observation from MIC and ceftizoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - In vitro activities of ceftizoxime (CZX) against 328 clinical isolates were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml. CZX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Proteus vulgaris with MIC values below 0.20 microgram/ml. It was also active against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes with MIC85 of 3.13 micrograms/ml. CZX was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, showing inhibitory activities against only 47 and 78% of these clinical isolates, respectively, at a dose level of 12.5 micrograms/ml. CZX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis. The reliability of CZX disc diffusion susceptibility tests for quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was also investigated using 8 mm diameter discs (Showa) and 6 mm diameter discs (Eiken), both of which contained 30 micrograms/disc of CZX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, hence the CZX disc susceptibility test should be useful for the estimation of proper dose levels of CZX, except against P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis. For the interpretation of CZX disc tests, a 3 category system has been used in USA and Europe, but a 4 category system is generally used in Japan. The 3 category system uses break points to classify bacteria into 3 categories of susceptibility according to MIC values as follows: resistant (R) MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (MS) MIC 16-32 micrograms/ml, and susceptible (S) MIC less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - Lectins for the identification of ocular bacterial pathogens.
AB  - In a preliminary in vitro investigation, fluorescein-conjugated lectins were used in the identification of bacteria commonly involved in ocular infections. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Strep. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hemophilus influenzae, and Proteus mirabilis were incubated with each of eleven lectins using a slide technique. Bacterial fluorescence was readily observed with a fluorescence microscope. All clinical isolates bound wheat germ agglutinin. The Gram-positive isolates bound Concanavalin A, while the Gram-negative isolates did not, with rare exceptions. Streptococcal species isolates reacted with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin, while staphylococcal species isolates did not. Lectins may be useful in furthering the initial identification of causative organisms in bacterial ocular infections.
TI  - Tissue concentrations of ofloxacin in the middle ear.
AB  - Twenty patients with chronic otitis media underwent tympanoplasty and were given  an oral dose (two 200-mg tablets) of a new antibiotic, ofloxacin, three to seven hours before surgery. The study aimed to demonstrate satisfactory concentrations of ofloxacin in the middle ear as the basis for that agent's well-known clinical efficacy. The main pathogens responsible for bacterial infections in the ear, nose, and throat, especially those in the ear, are Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and alpha-streptococci. The chemotherapeutic agent used must reach adequate concentrations in the bone, mucous membrane, and serum. Mucous membrane, bone, and serum samples were obtained from the middle ear and examined for ofloxacin levels. The medication was also administered for a minimum of five days postoperatively. The average serum level of ofloxacin was 2.1 micrograms/ml, and the concentrations in both the mucous membrane and bone (2.2 micrograms/gm) were above the serum levels. The extent to which the concentrations at the possible site of infection exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for the pathogens was investigated at our clinic in 190 isolates. The study showed that, with the leading pathogens such as staphylococci, tissue concentrations were about four times higher than the MICs and that even Pseudomonas organisms were effectively inhibited. All patients had a satisfactory clinical response to therapy. The authors thus recommend a dosage of 400 mg of ofloxacin three to five hours prior to surgery for middle ear infection.
TI  - Bacterial endocarditis in a child with a Broviac catheter.
AB  - Broviac and Hickman catheters facilitate the care of children with cancer but provide a source of potential infection. We describe a child with a Broviac catheter who developed left-sided bacterial endocarditis in whom right-to-left atrial shunting was documented following catheter flushing. Following removal of the catheter and administration of prolonged intravenous antibiotics, recovery was complete and cardiac function returned to normal.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - Extended-wear lenses, biofilm, and bacterial adhesion.
AB  - While medical scientific knowledge pertaining to bacterial adhesion to biomaterials has become a rapidly growing field in most areas of medicine, its significance in ophthalmic infections has not been emphasized. Corneal bacterial ulceration in patients wearing extended-wear contact lenses has become a problem of epidemic proportions. The designation of the contact lens itself as a suitable substratum for bacterial colonization and as a source of subsequent inoculum to compromised epithelial cells are important factors in the pathophysiology of corneal ulcer formation. We demonstrate polysaccharide- (biofilm-)mediated adhesion to two ophthalmic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis) to the surface of a typical extended-wear contact lens in vitro using cytochemistry and scanning and transmission electron microscopic techniques. This interaction between the biomaterial and bacterial organisms, which represents a favorable self-protective environment for propagation and inoculation, is a previously overlooked area of importance in the mechanism of corneal ulceration associated with hydrophilic (soft) contact lenses.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from late prosthetic joint infections: dental treatment and chemoprophylaxis.
AB  - The recommended administration of prophylactic antibiotics, before and during dental procedures, to persons with total joint prostheses is not without controversy. Hospital and dental charts of 2,693 patients in whom total prosthetic joints were placed at the Veterans Administration Hospitals of Ann Arbor and Allen Park, Michigan, as well as the University of Michigan Hospital, were analyzed. The identity of the micro-organism associated with the late (6 months after placement) infected prosthetic joint and the sensitivity of the organisms to specific antibiotics were recorded. Of the 30 (1.1%) late prosthetic joint infections, only one (0.04%) could be temporally associated with dental treatment. Fifty-three percent of the isolates were gram-positive staphylococci, the most common isolate being Staphylococcus epidermidis (36%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most frequent gram-negative isolate cultured. Twenty-five of 34 isolates tested were resistant to penicillin, while only 3 of 36 isolates tested were resistant to a cephalosporin and 5 of 21 isolates tested were resistant to methicillin.
TI  - Growth of four microorganisms in polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans in reconstituted polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution (PEG-ELS) stored under refrigeration and at room temperature was studied. A standard inoculum of each organism was added to one of four 4-L containers (one organism per container). From each container 28 aliquots of 25-mL each were removed and stored under refrigeration or at room temperature. One container was not inoculated and served as a control. Duplicate aliquots of the inoculated and the control solutions were filtered and incubated for quantification of organisms on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 30. Solutions stored at room temperature supported the growth of S. marcescens and Ps. aeruginosa. The counts of these organisms increased to approximately 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL over 16 days. The counts of Staph. epidermidis in solutions stored at room temperature increased slightly over the first 24 hours and declined steadily to zero after day 4. C. albicans reached a maximum colony count of 5.84 cfu/mL on day 16 and steadily declined to 0.92 cfu/mL on day 30. Solutions stored under refrigeration did not support the growth of any microorganisms. Microbial growth was not detected in any of the control solutions over the 30-day study period. The polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution studied here should be refrigerated after reconstitution to minimize microbial growth. This solution may be used for up to 30 days after reconstitution when it is stored under refrigeration.
TI  - Activity of ciprofloxacin against multiply resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and group JK corynebacteria.
AB  - The susceptibilities of multiply resistant clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeurginosa to ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and several beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics were evaluated. Ciprofloxacin also was compared with methicillin and vancomycin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and group JK corynebacteria. Ciprofloxacin exhibited the lowest MICs and MBCs for 90% of the isolates among all of the antibiotics tested against P. aeruginosa. In addition, ciprofloxacin exhibited excellent bactericidal activity against the gram-positive organisms. Clinical trials are necessary to confirm the in vitro results and monitor for emergence of resistance.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ambulance oxygen humidifier water reservoirs: a potential source of pulmonary infection.
AB  - The risk and benefit of oxygen humidification during ambulance transport is unknown. We cultured the water in plastic multiple-use bottles of humidifiers on 30 randomly selected area ambulances during November 1985. There were 22 positive cultures. Potentially pathogenic bacteria (four Pseudomonas maltophilia, three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one Staphylococcus epidermidis) were found in nine samples. Assuming that the water in ambulance humidifiers should have been sterile, the findings are statistically significant (P less than .01). Because there is no evidence that humidification is of benefit for nonintubated patients receiving oxygen at flow rates of 4 L/min or less when environmental humidity is adequate, we suggest that such patients should receive oxygen without humidification during ambulance transport. All other patients requiring oxygen during ambulance transport should continue to receive humidified oxygen. If a multiple-use humidifier reservoir is to be used, a written policy for its use must be developed and there must be appropriate documentation of compliance with the policy. An alternative is to replace the multiple-use humidifier reservoir with single-use sterile disposable devices, which cost approximately $2.00 per unit.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new difluoro oxacephem, 6315-S.
AB  - 6315-S, a novel difluoromethyl thioacetamido oxacephem, had in vitro activity comparable to that of cefotaxime and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., inhibiting 90% at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. It inhibited piperacillin- and cefoperazone-resistant isolates in these species. 6315-S did not inhibit cefotaxime- or moxalactam-resistant Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, or Enterobacter cloacae (MICs for 90% of the strains tested were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml). Proteus vulgaris resistant to cefotaxime was inhibited. Pseudomonas species and Acinetobacter species were resistant (MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml). MICs for 90% of the Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis isolates were 4 micrograms/ml. 6315-S was highly active against anaerobic species of Clostridium, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and peptostreptococci and was superior to other agents against these organisms. 6315-S was not hydrolyzed by the major plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases, but it induced chromosomal beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of imipenem against 1386 clinical isolates.
AB  - 1386 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against imipenem by disc agar diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. agglomerans, E. cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozanae, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, P. rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Citrobacter diversus, C. freundii, Morganella morganii, Serratia liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. cepacia, P. maltophila, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, pneumococcus, Lancefield group A, B and D streptococci, viridans streptococci, diphtheroids and Bacillus species. In vitro activity of imipenem was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, methicillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 819 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 99.5% were susceptible to imipenem. Ninety-seven percent strains of P. aeruginosa were also susceptible to imipenem. All the 161 isolates of S. aureus and 116 of the 117 isolates of enterococci exhibited in vitro susceptibility to this antibiotic. All gram positive bacteria tested were inhibited by imipenem except 28% isolates of S. epidermidis and 5% isolates of S. agalactiae.
TI  - The nosocomial colonization of T. Bear.
AB  - A national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the National Institutes of Health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. The program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (T. Bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. One of the items used is a stuffed toy T. Bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. Considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the T. Bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. A prospective study of 39 sterilized T. Bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. Hospital acquired organisms cultured from the T. Bear included Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, Corynebacterium acnes, Micrococcus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus sp, and species of Candida, Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Aspergillus and others. Concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. Although the T. Bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Population analysis of susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid in Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (Cfl) and nalidixic acid (Nal) was tested in vitro by means of the population analysis technique against six strains of Staphylococcus, one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and seven strains from five genera of Enterobacteriaceae. All strains of Staphylococcus were uniformly resistant to Nal as was the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, all bacteria being resistant to 250- less than 500 micrograms/ml. The Enterobacteriaceae were heterogeneous as regards susceptibility to Nal. With some strains minority populations of highly-resistant bacteria could be detected with frequencies of about 10(-6.3). The MIC for Cfl for the staphylococci varied between 0.25 and 0.50 microgram/ml. There were no differences in MIC of penicillinase-producing and penicillin-susceptible strains, either in Staphylococcus aureus or in Staphylococcus epidermidis. The MIC for Cfl in the enterobacteria varied between 0.004 and 0.03 microgram/ml. The MIC for Cfl in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC for Cfl increased in all strains when the parental strains were compared to bacteria selected from the plates with the highest concentration permitting growth, indicating heterogeneity against Cfl. But while the MIC of the selected enterobacteria were lower than one fourth of the level obtainable in serum, the MIC of the selected staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were either exceeding the level obtainable in serum or were only a little lower than this level. While Cfl thus seems to be a promising antimicrobial agent in the treatment of infections caused by enterobacteria, the suitability for infections caused by staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be further explored.
TI  - [Bacterial interference with skin colonization in germfree hairless mice].
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the digestive tract and the skin was studied over a 3-week period in a group of 10 germfree HRS mice using Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sequential utilization of two strains allowed us to carry out six assays and to show the presence of interference phenomena during colonization of the skin. When P. aeruginosa was given after challenge with S. aureus or S. epidermidis, it did not colonize the skin. If the first challenge was done with P. aeruginosa, this bacteria was eliminated within 10 days by S. aureus and S. epidermidis on the skin, but it succeeded in colonizing the digestive tract. When the first challenge was done with S. aureus, colonization of the skin and the digestive tract with S. epidermidis was prevented, whereas these two species were found in association when S. aureus was given in second place. None of the in vitro assays (mixed culture, bacteriocin production, adherence inhibition, antimicrobial activity) could explain the in vivo observations.
TI  - Cefoperazone for empiric therapy in patients with impaired renal function.
AB  - Thirty-five patients with serious infections and impaired renal function were treated empirically with 2 to 8 g of cefoperazone per day. Infections included sepsis in 14, nonbacteremic urinary infections in nine, pneumonia in five, intra-abdominal infection in five, fasciitis in one, and malignant otitis externa in one. The average age of this group was 64.3 years, 25 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases, and their average serum creatinine level was 5.2 mg/dl. Infections were caused by Enterobacteriaceae in 23 patients, Streptococcus faecalis in five, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in four, Staphylococcus aureus in four, Hemophilus influenzae in three, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Clostridium sordelli in one each. Overall, 32 patients had clinical and microbiologic cures, two had improvement, and one had failure. Hypoprothrombinemia occurred in 18 of 28 patients not given vitamin K for prophylaxis and occurred more often in those with serum albumin concentrations below 3.5 g/dl. Prothrombin times returned to normal within 36 hours of treatment with vitamin K, although two patients experienced mild hematemesis. In anicteric patients with liver function abnormalities, 2 g every 12 hours produced peak and trough serum concentrations that averaged 254 and 125 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared with 179.5 and 19.5 micrograms/ml, respectively, in five with normal liver function test results. In jaundiced patients treated with 1 g every 12 hours, trough concentrations were comparably elevated. Serum concentrations did not correlate with hypoprothrombinemia, but high levels throughout the dosing interval may have contributed to the excellent cure rate in this study.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  - The charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. All patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. The most common organisms cultured were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, Candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10 patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, Enterobacter, 16 cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. The classic isolates, Escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and Bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. To determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. Candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and S. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. The spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those with acute peritonitis. Despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.
TI  - Comparison of bacteria in the tympanic cavity and the mastoid antrum in chronic otitis media.
AB  - Materials collected from the tympanic cavity before operation and from the mastoid antrum during operation of 58 discharging ears of patients with chronic otitis media were cultured, and the bacteria in these two cavities were compared. Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest organism in the tympanic cavity, and S epidermidis in the mastoid antrum. Anaerobic bacteria were found only in the mastoid antrum of patient with cholesteatoma. In 32 (55 per cent) of the 58 ears examined, bacteria were detected in both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. In 17 ears (53 per cent), the bacterial strains in the two cavities differed. The results indicate the necessity of bacteriologic examination of the mastoid cavity during operation to select antibiotics for postoperative treatment.
TI  - Effects of infection on oxygen consumption and core temperature in experimental thermal injury.
AB  - Oxygen consumption (VO2) and colonic temperature (Tc) were measured in groups of  rats before and after 30% total body surface, full thickness burns. Some wounds were seeded with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus epidermidis, and some seeded wounds were treated with Sulfamylon or Silvadene. Three groups became bacteremic (B) during the 2-3 week period of observation. At an ambient temperature (Ta) of 32 C, VO2 of the B group rose from 0.83 +/- 0.01 to 1.20 +/- 0.01 ml/hr/g (mean +/- S.E., p less than 0.001) versus 0.81 +/- 0.01 to 0.99 +/- 0.02 for nine nonbacteremic (NB) groups (p less than 0.001). Tc increased only in the B groups--from 36.8 +/- 0.1 to 37.7 +/- 0.1 C (p less than 0.001). In the second or third week postinjury, VO2 of the NB rats was reduced when Ta was increased to 34 C; Tc followed changes in Ta. Sulfamylon lowered VO2 of P. aeruginosa seeded, NB rats. The metabolic cost of wound contamination appeared to vary with bacterial strain. The metabolic effects of infection appear to be a continuum, beginning with a modest rise in VO2 and progressing to greater increases in VO2 and Tc with wound invasion and systemic infection.
TI  - Risk factors for wound infections after genitourinary reconstructive surgery.
AB  - In January through August 1983, eight children developed wound infections after they underwent genitourinary reconstructive surgery at one hospital. Cultures of purulent drainage yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two cases, Streptococcus faecalis in one case, both S. faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis in one case, and S. faecalis and other Gram-negative rods in four cases. A study in which uninfected children who had had genitourinary reconstructive surgery were used as controls revealed that all cases and controls had received cephalosporin prophylaxis. Antibiograms revealed that all organisms were resistant to the cephalosporin antibiotics tested. Risk of infection was associated with shaving (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and exposure to one nurse (nurse X) (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test) and one surgeon (surgeon X) (p = 0.007, Fisher's exact test). Nurse X was the private scrub nurse for surgeon X; she was present only at operations surgeon X performed (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test) and had no reported or observed practices different from those of other surgical nurses. However, surgeon X had two practices that were notably different from those of other surgeons: 1) he used quaternary ammonium compounds, acetone/alcohol, and 1 per cent hexachlorophene for preoperative skin preparation; and 2) he prepared the operative site himself. In addition, he was observed to prepare the operative site by beginning centrally, moving peripherally, and returning to the central area with the same sponge. These findings suggested that the shaving of the operative site and the use of certain agents and/or different preparatory techniques may have contributed to increased risk of wound infections. These wound infections were caused by organisms resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic(s) used.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of enoxacin (CI-919).
AB  - Antibacterial activity of enoxacin was evaluated against more than 3,700 clinical isolates using the agar-dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4)-10(5) cells per site. For comparison other antibiotics appropriate for each species were also included. For most enterobacteria and for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of enoxacin was below 2 mg/l. Serratia marcescens was more resistant; the MIC90 being 4 mg/ml. Enoxacin also showed high activity against Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Streptococci were comparatively resistant, 32 mg/l to 64 mg/l of the compound being required to inhibit 90% of strains.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - Management of bacterial corneal ulcers.
AB  - A prospective microbiological study of 48 patients with corneal ulcers due to bacterial infection was performed. Positive cultures of corneal ulcer samples were obtained in 60% of all patients; about half of these patients had received antimicrobial treatment prior to sampling. A relatively high incidence of Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated from ulcer patients (27%) compared with normal controls (10%). Gram stains of ulcer samples were positive for organisms in only 27% of all patients and were not considered useful in determining initial therapy in this series. We concluded that treatment should be started with a broad combination of antibiotics while awaiting the culture results.
TI  - Extracranial mycotic aneurysms in infective endocarditis.
AB  - Nine of 217 (4.15%) patients with infective endocarditis who were followed from October 1978 to February 1984 had extracranial mycotic aneurysms (MA). Age range of patients was 6-43 years (mean of 24.8 years) and 7 were male. Etiologic agents were Streptococcus viridans (3 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (2 cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (1 case), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case). Two patients had negative blood cultures. The MA involved the arteries of the limbs (5 cases), thoracic (3 cases), and abdominal (1 case) arteries. The diagnosis was made by means of physical examination (5 cases), chest roentgenogram (2 cases), ultrasound examination (1 case), and aortography (1 case), at hospital admission (2 cases), early or before antibiotic therapy (2 cases), and from two days to six months after finishing antibiotic therapy (5 cases). All but one patient were operated upon due to MA; bleeding occurred in three cases; surgery was an emergency procedure in one case and performed from 8 to 58 days after the diagnosis of the MA in the others. Signs of infection at surgery were found in one case. In the others, further antibiotic therapy was not administered. There were no limb losses in the peripheral MA. Four patients received surgical treatment for endocarditis. There was one in-hospital death and another one 6 months later due to heart failure.

TI  - Synergy of fosfomycin with beta-lactam antibiotics against staphylococci and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fosfomycin inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis at the initial stage. It can act synergistically with beta-lactams. The effect of the combination of fosfomycin and selected penicillins and cephalosporins against staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and selected Gram-negative bacteria was determined. Synergy was determined by agar dilution and checkerboard titration methods; synergy was defined as an FIC index less than or equal to 0.5 and partial synergy greater than 0.5 to 0.75. Concentrations of drugs used were those that would be reached in man by intravenous and oral routes. Fosfomycin combined with nafcillin and with cefotaxime against staphylococci showed synergy for most isolates. For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, synergy or partial synergy was found for 90% of isolates. Synergy was less frequently found with Staphylococcus epidermidis. The MICs for S. aureus were reduced from greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml to less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Fosfomycin was synergistic with ticarcillin, piperacillin, azlocillin, ceftazidime, aztreonam and imipenem against 31 to 61% of P. aeruginosa. MICs were reduced from greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml to 8-32 micrograms/ml, depending upon the agent. Although fosfomycin acted synergistically with azlocillin, piperacillin and ceftazidime against some P. cepacia, most often there was an indifferent interaction and MICs were in the resistant range, greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. The interaction of fosfomycin and ampicillin was synergistic against a number of strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri, yielding MICs in an achievable range. The combination of fosfomycin with beta-lactams may be clinically useful in selected situations, particularly for methicillin-resistant staphylococci and beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Adherence of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains to human lung fibroblasts in vitro.
AB  - The adherence to eukaryotic cells of Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and the yeast Candida albicans was studied by light microscopy with an in vitro micromethod involving different cell lines. The method is inexpensive, consumes little time and material, and is reproducible. It was used to show that the gram-positive Cowan I strain of S. aureus, which naturally forms protein A on its surface, adheres in much larger numbers to human lung fibroblasts than the protein A-free Wood 46 strain, the strain of S. epidermidis, and the encapsulated Smith strain. The presence of a capsule on the latter strain apparently prevented its attachment to the fibroblasts. Among the gram-negative species studied, a piliated clinical isolate of N. gonorrhoeae, displaying the opaque colonial phenotype, adhered in larger numbers than another isolate lacking pili and displaying the transparent phenotype. E. coli K12 attached slightly to the cell line, whereas P. aeruginosa adhered to it moderately. One strain of C. albicans tested did not attach in any detectable numbers. No clear correlation between bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity, as evaluated by the hexadecane assay, and adherence to eukaryotic cells could be demonstrated for these microorganisms. With our method, bacterial attachment proceeded best at 37 degrees C and did not require more than 1 h of contact with the cell monolayer. The method described revealed differences in the adherence to eukaryotic cells, not only among species, but also between strains of the same species.
TI  - An in vitro study of the interaction between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime.
AB  - The in vitro activities of cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), cefuroxime (CXM) and ceftizoxime (CTZ) were compared against 272 recent clinical isolates and the effect of CTX and DES in combination was studied using agar dilution checkerboards. CTX and CTZ had similar activity, inhibiting 90% of Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and Providence spp. at 0.0075 mg/l. Ninety percent of Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. were inhibited by 1 mg/l of CTX and CTZ. Ninety percent of staphylococci were inhibited by 4 mg/l of CTX, although CTZ was significantly less active against strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci had MICs for CTX of 32 and 128 mg/l respectively. DES had similar activity to CXM with MICs 2 to 5 dilutions less than CTX and CTZ. In checkerboard tests, synergy (FIC less than 0.5) between CTX and DES was demonstrated against 34% of isolates overall, with antagonism (FIC greater than 1) in 24%. CTX and DES were synergistic against 72% of staphylococci and 50% of enterococci. They were antagonistic against 81% of Enterobacter spp. and 62% of Serratia spp. although both species were susceptible to CTX alone. There was an additive effect or slight antagonism with 90% of Ps. aeruginosa. Other investigators have reported lower incidences of antagonism between CTX and DES: this could be due to variations among the collections of clinical isolates or methodologies used. The relevance of the in vitro interaction between CTX and its metabolite to the antimicrobial activity of CTX in vivo remains to be demonstrated.
TI  - Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against some selected gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were tested against five selected groups of clinical bacterial isolates. Both were active against: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, irrespective of their resistance to methicillin or gentamicin; Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, irrespective of their beta-lactamase production; members of the Enterobacteriaceae family which were resistant to most oral beta-lactams, and most intestinal bacterial pathogens including Campylobacter, Vibrio, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia. Ciprofloxacin was found more active than ofloxacin against Pseudomonas with most isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens susceptible, while those of Pseudomonas cepacia were resistant.
TI  - Effect of 5-fluorouracil, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, and vincristine on the antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefotiam, piperacillin, and netilmicin.
AB  - Using the checkerboard agar dilution technique, antibacterial activity and in vitro interactions of 4 antineoplastic agents and 5 antimicrobial drugs were examined against 56 strains of 7 bacterial species. 5-fluorouracil was found to inhibit all strains of Staphylococcus aureus and of Staphylococcus epidermidis at a concentration of 0.8 micrograms/ml or less. 84% of all gram-negative strains were inhibited synergistically when 5-fluorouracil was combined with beta-lactam antibiotics. Methotrexate and cefotiam were antagonistic in 42% of all combinations, especially when tested against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Growth of bacteria and fungi in total nutrient admixtures.
AB  - Total nutrient admixtures (TNAs) containing dextrose, amino acids, and fat emulsion were evaluated for their ability to support bacterial and fungal growth. The following solutions were tested: a standard adult total parenteral nutrient (TPN) solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a standard neonatal TPN solution with dextrose, amino acids, and electrolytes, a 10% fat emulsion, a 20% fat emulsion, a TNA with 40% of the total calories as fat, a TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a neonatal TNA with 25% of the total calories as fat, a control (fat emulsion was replaced with an equal amount of sterile water) for solution 5, and a control for solution 6. Serial dilutions of each solution were inoculated with 5 X 10(5) bacteria/mL or 5 X 10(3) fungi/mL, incubated, and visually rated on a scale of 0 (no growth) to 4 (maximal growth). Bacterial growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and Group JK Corynebacterium was greater in the TNA solutions than in the control or standard TPN solutions. Escherichia coli, Candida tropicalis, and C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. Torulopsis glabrata grew better in solutions that did not contain fat emulsion. Growth characteristics did not differ significantly between the adult and neonatal (more dilute) solutions. The addition of fat emulsion to TPN solutions enhances the ability of these solutions to support bacterial growth; this possibility must be considered when evaluating patients for this type of total parenteral nutrition therapy.
TI  - Semipermeable occlusive dressings. Effects on growth of pathogenic bacteria and reepithelialization of superficial wounds.
AB  - Six commercially available semiocclusive dressings were tested for their effect on the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria and the reepithelialization of experimentally induced wounds in human volunteers. Scarification and abrasion-type wounds inoculated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were quantitatively cultured at different times after being covered with the dressings. Reepithelialization was assessed by serial stereomicrographs. None of the dressings was able to prevent clinical infection. All dressings provided microenvironments that were conducive to the growth of resident and pathogenic bacteria. There was no difference in the rates of reepithelialization.
TI  - [Clinical experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of severe infections in general surgery].
AB  - In a prospective study 43 patients (19 men, 24 women) suffering from severe bacterial infections such as peritonitis (n = 16), soft tissue infection (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 7), septicemia (n = 6), catheter sepsis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 4), osteomyelitis (n = 3), complicated urinary tract infection (n = 2) or endocarditis (n = 1) were treated t. i. d. with short-time i. v. infusions of 0.5 g imipenem/cilastatin for five to 37 days (means = 9). All the patients were cured or significantly improved following therapy with imipenem/cilastatin alone or in combination with surgical intervention. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. 58 (83%) of the 70 pathogens isolated initially were eliminated. The 12 microorganisms (gram-negative aerobic bacteria) which persisted were non-contributory to the course of the infection and had MICs between 0.32 and 4 mg/l. The MICs for 60 isolates were less than or equal to 1 mg/l; the MICs for nine isolates were in the range of 2 to 8 mg/l. One S. epidermidis isolate presented primary resistance to imipenem (MIC 16 mg/l). The tolerability was good. Phlebitis was observed in one case only. Based on our experience we conclude that monotherapy with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage of 0.5 g t. i. d. is appropriate for the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. The activity of ofloxacin was two to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was more active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., Legionella spp., and Bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin, enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa. Ofloxacin strongly inhibited DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase purified from E. coli KL-16. There is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its inhibitory action against DNA gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of E. coli. These results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against DNA gyrase in bacterial cells.
TI  - Protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  - Factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. Protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. Host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. Microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. Nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. Microorganisms including Bacteroides bivius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, and Propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. Protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.
TI  - A comparison between a detergent baby bath additive and baby soap on the skin flora of neonates.
AB  - A detergent based baby bath additive as an alternative to soap for bathing neonates was investigated. The yield of Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Pseudomonas spp., Candida spp. and coliforms from skin swabs was compared in a group of 22 babies bathed in the detergent additive with a similar group of 22 babies bathed in soap. No differences were detected in the isolation rate of these organisms between the two groups.
TI  - Microbial adhesion to fibronectin in vitro correlates with production of endocarditis in rabbits.
AB  - Microbial adhesion to the constituents of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is an important early event in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. Fibronectin is a ubiquitous mammalian glycoprotein with diverse functions which binds to certain bacteria but not to others. In this study, we determined that fibronectin is present on the surface of NBTE (after catheter-induced aortic valve trauma) but not on normal rabbit cardiac valvular endothelium. The adhesion of various bacteria and yeasts to human fibronectin in tissue culture wells was then measured. Microorganisms with a high isolation frequency from endocarditis cases (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida tropicalis, C. albicans, Streptococcus faecalis, S. sanguis) bound significantly better (P less than 0.01) to fibronectin in vitro than other organisms (Escherichia coli, C. krusei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) rarely implicated in this disease. Microbial adhesion to fibronectin correlated closely with the propensity of each organism to produce endocarditis in rabbits (e.g., ID50) with preexistent NBTE. A similar distribution was noted after binding of soluble radiolabeled fibronectin to bacteria in suspension. The results suggest that fibronectin, expressed on the surface of NBTE, may mediate microbial adhesion of circulating organisms to initiate colonization during the early pathogenesis of infective endocarditis.
TI  - Evaluation of the sterility and stability of insulin from multidose vials used for prolonged periods.
AB  - Diabetic patients frequently use their insulin vials for prolonged periods, even  though antibacterial preservatives used in multidose insulin vials are not required to be effective beyond 28 days. For this reason, we evaluated the antibacterial activity present in multidose insulin vials for up to 50 days. Multidose lente insulin vials were inoculated with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Vials incubated at room temperature (21 degrees C) were sterile by 48 hours, whereas when they were incubated at refrigerator temperatures (4 degrees C), S. aureus contamination persisted up to the 17th day and P. aeruginosa were killed after 10 days. The same vials were serially contaminated on days 17, 30, and 50, and a similar antibacterial effect was maintained. Sixty-nine multidose insulin vials used for an average of 53 days were cultured. Eight vials demonstrated bacterial contamination with 1 cfu/ml of S. epidermidis or Propionibacterium acnes. No endotoxin was detected in the multidose vials used for more than 28 days. Insulin assays on 40 multidose insulin vials used for more than 28 days showed an average insulin content of 101.6 +/- 1.9 units/ml. This study did not demonstrate significant bacterial contamination, endotoxin activity, or insulin degradation of multidose insulin in vials used for periods longer than 28 days. In addition, antibacterial preservatives were more effective at room temperature than at refrigerator temperature; thus, the practice of patients not refrigerating insulin vials is sensible.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Empirical use of imipenem as the sole antibiotic in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - Seventy-three patients with eighty-five infections were treated with imipenem as  the sole antimicrobial agent. Some of these infections were caused by pseudomonads and enterococci resistant to other cephalosporins. The vast majority of the Gram-positive and the Gram-negative bacteria that were isolated had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of less than 1 mg/l, and all MICs for initial isolates were below the levels of imipenem that were achieved in plasma and other body fluids with a dose of 500 mg every 6 h. The outcomes of 67 infectious episodes were satisfactory, four outcomes were failures and 14 were not evaluable. During the two years of this study, only a few strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa emerged which were resistant to imipenem.
TI  - Role of cephalosporins in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults. Overview with special emphasis on ceftazidime.
AB  - Experience with the use of first-generation cephalosporins in bacterial meningitis has been disappointing; low concentrations were obtained in the cerebrospinal fluid, and therapeutic failures were encountered. Of the second-generation cephalosporins cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin, only cefuroxime has proved efficacy in meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or Hemophilus influenzae. The third-generation cephalosporins offer new advantages in the treatment of meningitis because they are active at the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations obtainable. Cefotaxime has produced high cure rates in patients with meningitis caused by meningococci, pneumococci, or H. influenzae. Several controlled comparative studies indicate that ceftriaxone is as effective as conventional treatment in therapy for neonatal or childhood meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, or H. influenzae. Moxalactam has been found in uncontrolled studies to be effective when the cause was enteric gram-negative bacilli. Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a high degree of beta-lactamase stability and a broad antibacterial spectrum, which includes Pseudomonas aeruginosa that enters the cerebrospinal fluid. Data from 29 patients who received ceftazidime as monotherapy for bacterial meningitis showed an overall cure or improvement rate of 75.9 percent. Therapy failed in three patients with meningitis caused by gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. agalactiae), and in three with gram-negative organisms. Of 14 patients with Pseudomonas meningitis, 11 showed a cure, as did six of six patients with meningitis caused by Enterobacter, Serratia, or Acinetobacter. More, preferably controlled, studies of the efficacy of ceftazidime in the treatment of meningitis should be undertaken.
TI  - Effective use of streptokinase for peritoneal catheter failure.
AB  - The fibrinolytic enzyme streptokinase (streptase) was infused into the peritoneal catheter in 19 episodes of catheter failure in 16 patients. Intraabdominal bleeding prior to infusion was seen in seven of these episodes. Fibrin strands and clots were present in four additional successful cases. Streptokinase successfully relieved the obstruction in 13 episodes in 11 patients. The procedure failed in two cases of omental ingrowth and in another with catheter malposition. Streptokinase infusion also failed in two patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one patient with Staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis. Intraperitoneal streptokinase infusion is simple and free of side effects. Its use should be considered in peritoneal catheter failure, particularly in cases where bleeding or fibrin accumulation may play a role.
TI  - Comparison of arterial and venous blood samples for the diagnosis of bacteremia in critically ill patients.
AB  - We compared the blood culture results obtained either by venipuncture or through  an arterial catheter in 51 critically ill patients with 217 clinically suspected episodes of bacteremia. During each episode, three blood culture samples, two arterial and one venous, were drawn within 1 h. One or more cultures were positive in 42 (19%) of the episodes, but there were great discrepancies between the results obtained by the two methods. In only eight cases did both methods give the same microorganism. In eight other episodes, the two arterial cultures were positive while the venous sample was negative, probably indicating a continuous contamination of the catheter system. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the two most common microbes. The frequency of positive arterial catheter blood cultures did not increase with the length of catheter use. We conclude that an arterial catheter is not a reliable sampling site for blood cultures and does not replace the conventional venipuncture method.
TI  - Multicenter study of the clinical efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin for treatment of serious infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of imipenem/cilastatin was evaluated in a multicenter study. For 49 of the 78 patients with 79 infections entered into the study, the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of therapy could be evaluated. Toxicity data were analyzed for all 79 infections. Overall, 35 of 49 infections were cured or improved: 10 of 11 cases of pneumonia; 8 of 15 cases of pyelonephritis; 4 of 5 cases of osteomyelitis; 3 of 4 intravascular infections; 6 of 9 soft tissue infections; and 4 of 5 miscellaneous infections. There were 13 bacteriologic failures; superinfections with resistant organisms (i.e., Candida albicans, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas maltophilia) occurred in three patients; reinfection with sensitive pathogens complicated one urinary tract infection; relapses developed of five urinary tract infections and of one case of endarteritis; and bacteriologic persistence occurred in three soft tissue infections. Infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most difficult to treat. In only six of 11 P. aeruginosa infections was both bacteriologic and clinical cure achieved. Adverse effects were minimal; no serious hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no adverse renal effects were noted.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of imipenem: the first thienamycin antibiotic.
AB  - Imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) is the first representative of a new class of beta-lactam antibiotics--the carbapenems. Imipenem has an unusually broad spectrum, high potency, and no cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. Susceptible gram-negative species include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, and Enterobacter. Activity is high against Staphylococcus aureus, most group D streptococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis but is variable against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Imipenem is more active against Bacteroides than are other beta-lactam agents, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and clindamycin. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 98% of 30,655 isolates--excluding those of the three resistant species (Pseudomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Streptococcus faecium)--were less than 8 micrograms/ml, the susceptibility breakpoint adopted for clinical trials. Imipenem is bactericidal (minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs] less than twice the MICs). For P. aeruginosa, MBCs of imipenem are less influenced by high inoculum density rather than are MBCs of antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins. Stability of imipenem to diverse classes of plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases accounts for its lack of cross-resistance with other beta-lactam antibiotics. Imipenem is also active against P. aeruginosa with non-lactamase-mediated resistance to classical beta-lactam agents. Efficacy of imipenem was shown in animal models, including septicemia in normal and neutropenic rodents and P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Imipenem also has a unique postantibiotic effect against P. aeruginosa in vivo.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). Moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. Of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. On combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. The combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. Secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. Rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. In combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. In subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. Of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. Synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. Using this combination, secondary resistance of Pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. When ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro inhibitory and killing activity of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant and tolerant and nontolerant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - With a macrotube dilution method, MICs and MBCs were determined for three aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, cefpirome (HR 810), ceftazidime, and cefotaxime, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant, -susceptible, and -tolerant strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Comparatively, cefpirome was the most active agent against all gram-positive cocci, including enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and was as active as ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. MBCs of cefpirome were within two dilutions of the MICs for 91% of P. aeruginosa and 90% of gram-positive cocci strains tested, except methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MBCs were within three dilutions for 90% of strains.
TI  - Imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - Imipenem is a new broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic, which when administered  with cilastatin may be a suitable alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside and either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole as therapy for intraabdominal infections. The clinical and microbiologic results for 164 assessable patients given imipenem/cilastatin for intraabdominal infections are reported. Only three of 416 bacterial strains isolated prior to therapy from intraabdominal infection sites were resistant to imipenem (one of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one of Morganella morganii, and one of the Fusobacterium varium). Resistance acquired during treatment was reported in four cases: for three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and for one strain of Proteus mirabilis. Of 412 strains susceptible to imipenem prior to therapy, 359 were eradicated during treatment. The frequency of clinical cure or improvement was 91%. Imipenem/cilastatin seems to be a useful alternative to the combination of an aminoglycoside with either clindamycin or a nitroimidazole.
TI  - Contamination of corneal tissue from infected donors.
AB  - Thirty-two corneas with scleral rims were cultured from the eyes of 17 cadavers that harbored systemic infection at the time of death. Twelve (71%) of 17 cadavers demonstrated corneal contamination from one or both corneas. Eleven (92%) of 12 donors with positive postmortem blood cultures had positive corneal cultures from at least one eye. Six of these 12 had the same organism isolated from both the blood and corneal tissue. Bacterial corneal cultures were negative in the five donors with negative postmortem blood cultures. Control cultures were obtained from 19 eyes of ten donors without evidence of infection at death. Four (21%) of 19 control eyes yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis. There was a significantly higher incidence of corneal contamination in donors who died with systemic infections. Eye banks should continue to screen donors carefully for documented or suspected sepsis in an effort to reduce the incidence of postkeratoplasty infections.
TI  - The growth of micro-organisms in intravenous fluids.
AB  - The growth of four micro-organisms in 12 different intravenous fluids at room temperature was studied. Gram-negative organisms grew better than Gram-positive, and lipid solutions were most favourable to microbial growth. Microbial growth was inhibited in solutions with osmolalities over 500 mosmol/l; Staphylococcus epidermidis was inhibited by inocula with Gram-negative bacilli, while the growth of Gram-negative bacilli generally was not affected. Candida albicans was inhibited by Gram-negative bacilli in lipid and 5% dextrose solutions.
TI  - Clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - The Roche Septi-Chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans and C. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001) and Gardnerella vaginalis (P less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. Staphylococci (P less than 0.01), Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli (P less than 0.05), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (P less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. The overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.
TI  - [Studies of isolated organisms from otorhinolaryngological infections and their susceptibilities to macrolide antibiotics].
AB  - To study current situation of pathogenic bacteria and their drug resistance to macrolide antibiotics in the otorhinolaryngological infections, 609 strains diagnosed as pathogen derived from 463 patients were collected from cohospitals or institutions during the period of 1980-1983. The results obtained were as follows: Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was dominant (410 strains) and major species were S. aureus (135 strains), S. pneumoniae (81 strains), S. epidermidis (68 strains) and S. pyogenes (65 strains). In Gram-negative bacteria giving 147 strains and 43 strains, of anaerobes prevailing species were H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Peptostreptococcus spp. Representative species in the diseases were S. aureus (26.6%), S. epidermidis (24.5%), and P. aeruginosa (12.8%) in acute otitis media, S. aureus (34.4%), S. epidermidis (17.7%) and P. aeruginosa (14.6%) in acute exacerbation of chronic otitis media, S. epidermidis (17.0%), S. aureus (16.1%) and H. influenzae (13.4%) in acute paranasal sinusitis, S. pyogenes (29.1%), S. pneumoniae (19.6%) and S. aureus (15.1%) in acute tonsillitis. Although most of isolates were susceptible to macrolides, 62 resistant strains to macrolides were found in 501 strains and the resistant rates were 26.7% in S. aureus, 23.1% in S. epidermidis and 6.5% in S. pyogenes. The resistant pattern was somewhat different against each macrolides, resistant strains giving over 100 micrograms/ml in MIC were 55/62 in erythromycin, 35/62 in josamycin and midecamycin and 7/62 in TMS-19-Q, a new macrolide.
TI  - Twice-daily moxalactam versus gentamicin and clindamycin in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma.
AB  - The effectiveness and total costs of moxalactam administered every 12 hours versus a combination of gentamicin and clindamycin for prophylactic use in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma were compared. Fifty patients scheduled for laparotomy after penetrating abdominal wounds were randomly assigned to receive either clindamycin phosphate 600 mg every six hours with gentamicin (as the sulfate salt) 3-5 mg/kg/day in three divided doses or moxalactam disodium 2 g every 12 hours. Therapy was begun preoperatively and continued for a minimum of three days in patients without hollow-organ injury and five days in patients with hollow-organ injury; total duration of therapy could not exceed four weeks. Patients receiving moxalactam also received phytonadione 10 mg intramuscularly once a week. Although wound cultures from several patients were positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci, no symptomatic infections developed. No direct toxic effects of moxalactam or gentamicin-clindamycin were seen; transient abnormalities in blood-coagulation tests or serum creatinine concentration occurred in several patients. Although mean drug costs per patient for moxalactam and gentamicin-clindamycin were similar, the mean cost of therapy per patient was $125.23 higher for the combination regimen than for moxalactam when laboratory, personnel-time, and supply costs were added to drug costs. Moxalactam given every 12 hours was a safe and effective alternative to the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin for preventive use in the study patients with penetrating abdominal trauma.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of Trypticase soy broth in agar slide and conventional blood culture systems.
AB  - A commercially available biphasic blood culture system that utilizes an attachable agar slide paddle and Trypticase soy broth (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, Md.) was compared with a conventional Trypticase soy broth blood culture bottle in 6,867 paired blood cultures from adult patients. Both systems were inoculated with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. More clinically important bacteria and fungi, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., other Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were recovered from the biphasic system (P less than 0.001). In contrast, more anaerobic bacteria of importance were recovered in the conventional bottle (P less than 0.01). Staphylococci (P less than 0.001), gram-negative facultative and aerobic bacteria (P less than 0.001), and fungi (P less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas pneumococci (P less than 0.05) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. Of 603 clinically important microorganisms that grew in the biphasic system, 601 (99.7%) were detected by day 7 of incubation, but only 403 of 490 microorganisms (82.2%) were detected by day 7 in the conventional bottle. Overall, the biphasic system was superior to the conventional bottle. For optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the biphasic system should be used in conjunction with a complementary anaerobic conventional bottle.
TI  - Symposium on infections in the compromised host. The leukemias.
AB  - The treatment of acute leukemia in the adult causes prolonged and profound granulocytopenia. When the patient has less than 100 granulocytes per microliter, the risk of life-threatening infection is extremely high. Major infections include bacteremia, pneumonia, pharyngitis, esophagitis, colitis, perianal or perirectal lesions, and cellulitis. The major organisms are gram-negative bacilli (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus), the yeasts (Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata), and the filamentous fungi (Aspergillus flavus and fumigatus). Infection prevention includes the return to normal of the patient's host defense mechanisms, reduction of invasive procedures which breach body barriers, and methods to decrease the acquisition of potential pathogens, and to reduce the number of organisms colonizing the patient.
TI  - Prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Aspiration of the exudate through open perforation was performed in 48 children with chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-two aerobic and 93 anaerobic isolates were recovered. Aerobic bacteria only were involved in 22 patients (46%), and anaerobic organisms only were involved in five patients (10%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered from 21 patients (44%). The most common bacteria isolated were Bacteroides melaninogenicus group (40% of patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). There were 50 beta-lactamase-producing organisms (26 anaerobes and 24 aerobes) recovered from 33 patients (69%). Forty-four of these bacteria were isolated from the 37 patients recently treated with a penicillin. These included all ten isolates of S aureus and Bacteroides fragilis group, 11 of 19 of B melaninogenicus group, five of the 14 P aeruginosa, three of ten K pneumoniae, three of six of Bacteroides oralis, four of six of Haemophilus influenzae, two of three of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and two of four of Branhamella catarrhalis. The beta-lactamase-producing organisms have a possible role in the failure of penicillin therapy.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of N-chloramines and diazolidinyl urea.
AB  - A combination of MICs of an N-chloramine, a simple chlorinated amino acid, and diazolidinyl urea gave synergistic activity against bacteria, but not fungi. The two compounds at a higher concentration, 0.1 and 0.3%, respectively, gave synergistic inhibition of fungi; kill times were 1 h for Trichophyton tonsurans, 3 h for Aspergillus niger and Fusarium moniliforme, and 6 h for Aspergillus fumigatus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.
TI  - Effect of an expanded physical facility on nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - Fifty-two months' data were reviewed to assess the effect of a threefold increase in space per infant in a neonatal intensive care unit on rates of nosocomial infections (NIs) and colonization with Staphylococcus aureus (39 months in a crowded 18-bed unit and 13 months in a spacious 32-bed unit). Mean length of stay, survival rates, mean birth weights, and other parameters indicated that infant populations in the old and new units were similar. NI rates were not significantly different in the old and new units (11.7% and 9.6%, respectively; p = 0.17) nor were rates of colonization of anterior nares with S. aureus (11.7% and 10.7%; p = 0.5). NI rates, but not S. aureus colonization rates, were significantly higher during months of high patient turnover (p less than 0.01). Sites of infection were similar in the old and new units. There was, however, a significant change in bacterial species causing NI. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused 20.4% of NIs in the old unit, but only 2.1% in the new unit (p less than 0.001) and NIs caused by S. epidermidis increased from 4.7% to 14.9% (p = 0.02) in the new unit. There was also a marked decrease in the numbers of clusters of NI occurring in the new unit, indicating that cross-infections between infants were probably minimized.
TI  - [Infections caused by intravascular catheters].
AB  - Microbiological investigations showed a positive culture in 430 out of 1540 venous catheters and shunts for dialysis. In 21 cases, a mixed culture with two different specific organisms was present. Of the total of 451 isolated organisms, 362 were gram-positive cocci and only 56 gram-negative bacillaceae. Staphylococcus epidermidis was by far the most frequent pathogen (n = 228), staphylococcus aureus in second place (n = 94). Among the gram-negative organisms, germs of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter group and Pseudomonas aeruginosa dominated. Staphylococcus aureus represented 31% of all germs isolated from Scribner shunts and Brescia fistulas. On the other hand the causative organism could be isolated in only 18% of the infected venous catheters. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent pathogen in septicemia due to catheters; in 16 out of 24 patients this microorganism was found in both cultures drawn from the blood and from the catheter. In 16 cases, a venous catheter led to septicemia, a shunt for chronical dialysis in 2 cases only. The frequency of infections caused by catheters can be significantly lowered by prudent care of the site of insertion, sterile handling and short indwelling time.
TI  - Respiratory superinfections after the use of third-generation cephem antibiotics.
AB  - This paper is a report on our studies on superinfections in respiratory tract infections treated during the years 1981-1984. The isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and glucose non-fermentative gram-negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant to third-generation cephem antibiotics. These organisms proved to be widely distributed in hospitals and were frequently isolated from the sputum, excised lung and cardiac blood. The colonization of the sputum by bacteria in respiratory tract infections before, during and after treatment with third-generation cephem antibiotics revealed a tendency for these organisms to appear after treatment. Among the gram-positive cocci, S. faecium was most resistant to these antibiotics, followed by S. faecalis, S. epidermidis and S. aureus in that order. The incidence of resistant isolates in 1984 exceeded that in 1983, suggesting an annual increase in resistant bacteria.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Superinfections during antimicrobial treatment with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies.
AB  - The frequency, etiology and risk factors of superinfections during and/or within  one week after antibiotic therapy with betalactam-aminoglycoside combinations were evaluated in 631 patients with hematologic malignancies admitted to the Institute of Hematology of Rome from January 1982 to December 1984. 356 patients (56%) developed 402 episodes of proven or presumed infection. Of these patients, 78 developed 102 superinfections. Overall, superinfections responded less satisfactorily to antibiotic therapy than the primary febrile episodes (63% vs. 85%). The distribution of etiologic agents of superinfections differed from those responsible for primary infections, since fungi and anaerobes (especially Clostridium difficile) were mostly isolated after antibiotic therapy had begun. Moreover, among aerobic bacteria, frequently antibiotic-resistant species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were the leading etiologic agents of superinfection. The risk of superinfection appeared to increase with the depth and persistence of granulocytopenia. On the other hand, the length of hospitalization, length of previous antibiotic therapy, previous chemoprophylaxis and presence of indwelling venous catheter did not affect the risk of superinfection.
TI  - Quantitative evaluation and laboratory studies of topical antibiotic therapy in burns.
AB  
TI  - [The perfusate culture--bacteriologic monitoring of kidney grafts].
AB  - Since the kidney recipient's immune system is entirely suppressed, any bacterial  contamination from a graft might be hazardous. Major statistics [1,3,4,5] reveal a mortality as high as 10% due to infectious and gastrointestinal complications. From July 1979 to December 1983 114 kidney grafts have been done in our center. After transplantation none of the patients died as a result of complications due to infection. Microbiologic examination of the perfusate is obligatory to detect contamination. It was used in 145 donor nephrectomies; 28% of the perfusate culture samples were positive: In 4 of 5 cases (81%) the bacteria isolated were of the non-pathogenic type seen in the normal flora of the skin (Staphylococcus epidermidis). Introduction of cover drapes lowered the positive culture rate to 8%. Isolation of S. epidermidis after desinfection of the skin (6x) with 70% spore-free alcohol is proof of the extraordinary sensitivity of the method used. The outstanding clinical importance of this method is the rapid information obtained on any contamination and the early suggestion concerning the first choice of antibiotic. Though E.coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found in the culture, no clinical infection was seen under adequate antimicrobial therapy. Among 114 kidney transplantations in our center no patient died of bacterial infection. Our experience points out that the effect of general antibiotic prophylaxis is negligible. Instead, the effect of early application of antibiotics in accordance with the results of the perfusate culture is superior.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ceftriaxone against clinical bacterial isolates  in Nigeria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin derivative, recently introduced in Nigeria was compared with the activities of other related beta-lactam antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefuroxime, cephaloridine, cloxacillin/ampicillin and ampicillin against 530 local clinical isolates of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The spectra of activity and potency of ceftriaxone and cefotaxime were generally similar against the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia spp., Streptococcus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis when compared to cefotaxime. All the other beta-lactam antibiotics tested were less active than ceftriaxone. The action of ceftriaxone was bactericidal and the minimum inhibitory concentration values observed with R-plasmid beta-lactamase mediated resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and N. gonorrhoeae strains did not exceed the maximum value obtained with the beta-lactamase-negative strains.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and other agents against ocular pathogens.
AB  - 302 clinical isolates representing 16 bacterial species most often implicated in  ocular infections were tested in vitro against norfloxacin and a panel of antibacterial agents. On the basis of the 90% minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC90) data, norfloxacin was 4-32 times more active than the next best antimicrobial tested against Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with overall MIC90 less than or equal to 1 mg/l. Norfloxacin was equal in activity to polymyxin B against Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), and it ranked second to both polymyxin B against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cotrimoxazole against Staphylococcus aureus, (MIC90 = 2 mg/l in each case). Along with neomycin and cotrimoxazole, norfloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) ranked second to gentamicin and tetracycline against Moraxella species. Compared to erythromycin (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l), norfloxacin (MIC90 less than or equal to 16 mg/l) was considerably less active against streptococci. Overall, norfloxacin was the most active agent in both potency and antibacterial spectrum against the test organisms. These results suggest the potential use of norfloxacin in the treatment of superficial bacterial infections of the eye.
TI  - The relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  - One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.
TI  - Antimicrobial agent susceptibility patterns of bacteria in hospitals from 1971 to 1982.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to 16 commonly used antibiotics was analyzed for a 12-year period (from 1971 to 1982, inclusive). Susceptibilities of 5,828,243 strains isolated from a mean of 242 hospitals nationwide and of 194,575 strains isolated at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., and the Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center, New York, N.Y., were compared. Strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed virtually the same susceptibilities to antibiotics throughout the 12-year period, whereas Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant increases in resistance to most antibiotics. The close similarity between antibiotic susceptibilities shown at both the 242 hospitals and the 2 individual hospitals suggests that this analysis accurately reflects trends of bacterial resistance to antibiotics in U.S. hospitals. Since most of the species analyzed produce serious disease and high mortality, their susceptibility to antibiotics is relevant both to physicians treating infectious diseases and to epidemiologists.
TI  - In vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  - A review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. An evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean MIC90 being less than 8 mg/l. The MIC90 for cocci, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. The MIC90 for all Enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only Pseudomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic resistance. Imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the MIC usually being below 1 mg/l even for Bacteroides fragilis. Rare bacteria such as Nocardia asteroides, Listeria monocytogenes or fast growing Mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. Increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. In most species the MBC only slightly exceeded the MIC; however in the case of Streptococcus faecalis the MBC value was many times the MIC value. Synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. Induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Enoxacin: worldwide in-vitro activity against 22451 clinical isolates.
AB  - A worldwide multicentre study involving 31 centres in eight countries was conducted to compare the in-vitro activity of enoxacin with that of other currently available antibiotics. Enoxacin was active against virtually all of the species of Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25-2 mg/l). It was also effective at inhibiting Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 3540), Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis (MIC90 = 2 mg/l; n = 2635 and 837 resp.), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (MIC90 = 4 mg/l; n = 260), Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (both MIC90 less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l). The MIC90 for enoxacin against streptococci ranged from 8 to 32 mg/l. Comparison of data from Canada, West Germany, U.K., South Africa and New Zealand showed the MICs for enoxacin to be generally consistent throughout the world. The only exception was for Citrobacter freundii where the MIC90 was significantly higher in the U.K. than in West Germany (P less than 0.05 Mann Whitney U Test). Against susceptible species the activity of enoxacin was generally greater than that of ampicillin, gentamicin and the cephalosporins. Because of the prevalence of resistance to these drugs, there appears to be a continued need for new antibiotics with differing mechanisms of action.
TI  - Wide-spectrum antibiotic activity of bovine granulocyte polypeptides.
AB  - The antibiotic activity of a polypeptide fraction purified from bovine granulocyte granules was tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus and Enterobacter spp. All of these bacterial species were susceptible to the antibiotic polypeptide(s), with MICs ranging from 3 to 100 micrograms of protein per ml. The antimicrobial activity was resistant to boiling and abolished by proteinase treatment. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human fibroblasts grew normally in the presence of 100 and 50 micrograms of antibiotic polypeptide(s) per ml, respectively. [3H]thymidine incorporation into bacterial, but not fibroblast, DNA was efficiently and promptly inhibited by the antimicrobial polypeptide preparation. This suggests that its main target is a component of the system, which catalyzes and regulates the biosynthesis of bacterial DNA.
TI  - Postoperative ocular infections: an analysis of laboratory data on 750 cases.
AB  - From 1981-1982, 750 clinical specimens from patients who developed postoperative  infections were processed in the ocular microbiology laboratory. Bacterial cultures were positive in 71.0%, fungal in 1.3% and another 1.4% yielded both. The remaining 26.3% were sterile. Infections were due chiefly to Gram positive organisms (63.6%); only 6.4% were due to Gram negative bacteria while 0.9% were due to both. Staphylococcus aureus (52.0%) was the most common isolate, followed by S epidermidis (37.2%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were the next frequent pathogens. Aspergillus was the most common fungus among the fungal isolates. The highest number of infections followed cataract extraction and keratoplasty. A vast majority of postoperative infections seem to be occurring with hospital acquired strains. Cloxacillin seems to be the most effective remedy for treating staphylococcal infections and polymyxin B for infections due to Pseudomonas. Chloramphenicol appears to be as effective as gentamicin for treating all infections.
TI  - [Role of cross-infection in the development of postoperative complications].
AB  - The increased intensity and volume of surgical interventions in large surgical hospitals leads to a greater amount of postoperative complications. Intrahospital strains of infections are responsible for some of such complications. The complex investigations of the microbiological background allowed the range of prophylactic measures against gram-positive microflora to be enlarged.
TI  - Multiple pulmonary complications in a patient with Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
AB  - Since first described in 1922, Stevens-Johnson syndrome has been associated frequently with pneumonia of many etiologies. This "mucosal respiratory syndrome," first reported by Stanyon and Warner in 1945, is associated with "early" pneumonia which resolves 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the rash. In our patient, pneumonia began 10 days after rash onset and was nearly resolved by day 20. The unique feature of this case was the onset of late pulmonary complications 25 days after the appearance of the exanthem, manifesting as acute noninfectious interstitial disease with superimposed airway obstruction.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of coumermycin alone and in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  - Coumermycin has been shown to inhibit Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains that are susceptible and those that are resistant to methicillin at concentrations less than or equal to 0.05 micrograms/ml. Listeria monocytogenes and Corynebacterium spp. resistant to cephalosporins were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.6 micrograms of coumermycin ml, and streptococcal species, with the exception of Streptococcus faecalis, were inhibited by 0.1 micrograms/ml. Cross-resistance with beta-lactams or aminoglycosides was not found. Coumermycin acted synergistically with ofloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin against S. aureus but did not show synergy when combined with nafcillin, vancomycin, or rifampin. Coumermycin did not inhibit members of the family Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - Modified tissue culture medium for corneal storage. II. Investigation of the effect of the corneoscleral rim on bacterial contamination.
AB  - Our previous experiments showed the effect of time, temperature, and antibiotics  on replication of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa introduced into the modified tissue culture medium (MTCM). Penicillin G potassium was ineffective in the MTCM, and gentamicin sulfate was not uniformly effective against a gentamicin-sensitive organism. Placement of the MTCM at room temperature for two hours enhanced the antibacterial activity of gentamicin. Culturing techniques that fail to remove the antibiotic from the system are invalid. Experiments reported herein showed that the addition of the corneoscleral rim (or extraneous protein) prolongs the survival of these same organisms. Organisms can survive in the MTCM despite high concentrations of gentamicin. Maintaining the MTCM at room temperature for two hours after storage at 4 degrees C effectively reduces but may not completely eliminate the recovery of organisms. The antibiotic removal device may be superior to other methods for recovering viable organisms.
TI  - Modified tissue culture medium for corneal storage I. Investigation of the effect of antibiotics on bacterial contamination.
AB  - A series of experiments were performed to determine the effect of modified tissue culture medium (MTCM), temperature, time, and antibiotics on the replication of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A known inoculum of the organisms (usually 10(6)/mL) was introduced, and the recovery of viable organisms was compared by different methods of culturing, including techniques of diluting, inactivating, or removing the antibiotic from the system. The invalidity of techniques that failed to remove the antibiotic from the system was substantiated. The newly developed antibiotic removal device was superior to all other culturing techniques. Penicillin G potassium was ineffective in the MTCM system, and gentamicin reagent solution was not uniformly effective against a gentamicin-sensitive strain of P aeruginosa. Placement of the MTCM at room temperature for two hours enhanced the antibacterial activity of gentamicin, although organisms may still be recovered in small numbers.
TI  - Comparative study of bacterial and fungal floras of contracted sockets and fellow eyes.
AB  - Through studying 50 contracted sockets, our observations showed that generalized  and gross contractions were the most common. The main cause of loss of eyes was trauma. No correlation was observed between the cause of eye loss, type of surgery done, duration of eye loss, and the type of the socket. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common bacterial pathogen followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pathogens were encountered more commonly in the sockets wearing artificial eyes, a majority of which carried the same organisms. Staphylococcus epidermidis was seen most frequently in the fellow eyes. Fungal flora of the contracted sockets did not differ from that of the fellow eyes.
TI  - [Comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. Apropos of  135 cases].
AB  - The formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as Proteus sp. and some other bacteria. Ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. Its significance in the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. In this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and U. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained Proteus (27), E. coli (4), Staphylococcus epidermidis (3), Streptococcus D (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Corynebacterium (1), Candida albicans (1). U. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. Different bacteria were isolated from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). This findings suggest that Ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.
TI  - Recognition and clinical significance of mechanisms of bacterial resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  - Resistance to beta-lactams may be difficult to recognize. This is due to the difficulty in detecting these resistances, when the routine tests performed in diagnostic laboratories are interpreted in the usual manner. Since failure to recognize this type of resistance may have serious consequences for the patient, it is essential that it be detected when present. For the detection of methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus a standardized method using either a medium containing 5% NaCl or a low incubation temperature is advocated. Methicillin resistance of S. epidermidis can only be recognized reliably by means of a quantitative test and incubation for 42-48 h. Resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin may be intrinsic or it may be caused by a TEM beta-lactamase; a beta-lactamase test should be used to detect the latter type of resistance. Inducible cephalosporinase may be responsible for the rapid development of resistance of some bacterial species to cefamandole, even during therapy. If a stable beta-lactamase production is attained by mutation, resistance to other beta-lactams will usually be present as well. Routine induction tests should be performed for all isolates of species of Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter and Proteus, indole-positive. The same type of 'hidden' resistance may be present in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with regard to cefotaxime and other third-generation cephalosporins. Beta-lactamase-positive Neisseria gonorrhoeae can easily be recognized by a beta-lactamase test. In addition, the results of diffusion tests allow one to distinguish between beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains. Recognition of those strains of N. gonorrhoeae having a decreased susceptibility to penicillin is only possible when well-standardized quantitative tests are used.
TI  - [Bacterial colonization of the stomach in newborn infants with gastrostomy].
AB  - Quantitative bacterial cultures were carried out in 137 gastric aspirates of 52 neonates with gastrostomies due to intestinal malformations. In 28% there was no growth of any organism, in 72% we found one to four bacterial species. Most often enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and candida albicans could be cultured. We could not find any influence of systemic antibiotic therapy on bacterial colonization of the stomach. On the other hand nystatin given orally significantly decreased colonization by candida albicans. Different types of formulas or breast milk had no influence on types of species isolated. Clinically it was interesting to note that 12/52 children developed diarrhea and that 6 newborns developed septicaemia caused by the same organisms as we had found in elevated numbers in their gastric aspirates.
TI  - Effects of preservatives, steroids, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate on the antimicrobial activity of sulfacetamide.
AB  - The effect of EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetate), steroids, and preservatives on  the antimicrobial activity of 10% sodium sulfacetamide solutions was evaluated in this study by kill rate and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using five representative microorganisms. The results indicate that thimerosal-preserved sulfacetamide solutions containing EDTA are more effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans than similar paraben-preserved solutions. Furthermore, the addition of EDTA improves the kill rate, but not the MIC, for the Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Candida species regardless of the preservative. The combination of a steroid with sulfacetamide does not affect its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - The effects of severe protein-calorie malnutrition on antibacterial defense mechanisms in the rat lung.
AB  - Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) impairs systemic immunity in humans and animals, but its effects on regional defense mechanisms in the lung are not clear. Therefore, we investigated lung phagocytic antibacterial defenses in vivo and in vitro in an animal model of PCM. Matched groups of weanling rats consumed Isocaloric diets containing either 0.8% (PCM) or 24% protein (Control, C). A third group of animals was fed the C diet in restricted amounts to match the daily caloric intake of the PCM animals (pair-fed control, PF). After 4 wk on the diet, PCM animals were hypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, and anemic and had depressed systemic cell-mediated immunity. In vivo, the lung clearance rate of Listeria monocytogenes was markedly delayed in PCM animals (% bacterial recovery at 9 days, mean +/- SE:PCM = 120 +/- 25.1; PF = 5.2 +/- 3.0; C = 0.6 +/- 0.6; p less than 0.001 for PCM versus C). Only 36% of the PCM animals survived for 9 days after Listeria exposure, whereas more than 94% of the C and PF animals survived (p less than 0.01). Recruitment of macrophages to the lungs of PCM animals after Listeria aerosolization was markedly impaired compared with that in the PF and C animals (p less than 0.001). By contrast, lung clearance rates of 2 pyogenic organisms, Staphylococcus aureus 502a and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 177, were similar in all groups. In vitro, alveolar macrophage chemotaxis toward zymosan-activated serum, and microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis were also similar in all groups of animals. Our findings indicate that in the rat, PCM impairs the pulmonary clearance of L. monocytogenes, and that this defect is associated with impaired macrophage recruitment to the lung after Listeria inhalation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [UV irradiation of the peritoneal dialysis solution for the prevention of peritonitis].
AB  - Micro-organisms causing peritonitis during peritoneal dialysis or CAPD can reach  the peritoneal cavity either along the Tenckhoff-catheter or via contaminated dialysis fluid. Laboratory experiments with UV irradiation of artificially contaminated CAPD fluid were made to demonstrate whether decontamination could be achieved during the flow through a UV-penetrable (lambda 2537 A) section of the CAPD catheter. Five CAPD bags were contaminated with a fluid culture of the following micro-organisms which frequently cause peritonitis (S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and Candida albicans). After UV irradiation positive cultures could not be demonstrated. UV irradiation of the peritoneal dialysis fluid before entering the peritoneal cavity is proposed as an additional preventive measure.
TI  - Antibacterial activity studies of flavonoids from Salvia palaestina.
AB  - Ten aglycones and six glycosides of luteolin and apigenin were identified from the leaves of Salvia palaestina Bentham (Labiatae). Among them cirsimaritin showed a high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while the others have little or no activity against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - [Comparison of the in vitro activity of ceftazidime: in culture, in serum and in  combination with granulocytes].
AB  - The bactericidal activity of ceftazidime against 5 serum resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and 5 serum sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains was compared in Mueller-Hinton broth and normal human serum. Except for the first 4 hours incubation time ceftazidime was less active in serum as compared to broth against the serum resistant staphylococci at subinhibitory concentrations. Against the serum sensitive Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains the in vitro activity of ceftazidime in serum was significantly higher than in broth at all concentrations investigated. In vitro activity of ceftazidime was best in combination with leukocytes and serum against a Staphylococcus aureus and a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. Leukocytes in serum enhanced the bactericidal activity of ceftazidime against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain already at 1/4 MIC, which could only slightly be improved at 1 MIC, but not at 4 MIC.
TI  - [Bacterial species recently isolated from urinary tract infections and their antibiotic susceptibility, with special reference to acute cystitis].
AB  - Numbers of the strains of each bacterial species isolated from urinary tract infections were summed and their incidences were calculated for each a half year from the second half of 1980 to the first half of 1982. The incidences of Escherichia coli strains were found to be greatly reduced and those of Streptococcus faecalis strains were greatly increased. Those of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were also increased. This trend was thought to be caused by the extensive and exclusive use of cephalosporin derivatives. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), latamoxef (LMOX) and minocycline (MINO) against these isolated strains were estimated. The most sensitive drugs for E. coli were found to be CZX, LMOX, GM and AMK, CZX and MINO for Klebsiella, CZX and LMOX for Proteus, and GM for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All Gram-positive cocci were found generally to be most susceptible to MINO, but S. faecalis and other Pseudomonas were also sensitive to ABPC. Exclusive use of cephalosporins for the treatment may induce selective increases of the resistant species in normal flora. Since these flora could be the causative agents for various infections, these selections caused by the exclusive use of the monotype drugs are not preferable, and various different drugs should be used for the suitable cases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - The turbidimetric stability of common clinical bacterial isolates in water.
AB  - Ninety common clinical bacterial isolates were suspended in sterile deionized, tap and lake water to a turbidity of 100 Klett-Summerson Colorimeter Units. The suspensions were then measured for turbidity at seven and 14 days of storage at 25 degrees C. Turbidities for Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were stable for 14 days, however those of Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were unstable as evidenced by a decreased turbidity. Staphylococci were much less stable in deionized water than tap or lake water. Overall, the turbidity of most isolates was most stable in lake followed by tap and deionized water, respectively.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in intensive care unit areas.
AB  - The incidence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial resistance rates of nosocomial pathogens vary considerably among countries and even among intensive care units (ICUs) within one hospital. Such differences might be partly due to the selection pressure exerted by certain antibiotics, since intensive care patients are given more antimicrobials than any other group of patients. We therefore compared resistance rates of four important nosocomial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) isolated from patients in general wards and ICUs. There were few trends toward higher resistance of ICU isolates, and most differences were found with Klebsiella pneumoniae. We also tried to relate antibiotic use in ICUs and frequency of antibiotic resistance of five selected nosocomial pathogens. The ampicillin and cephalosporin resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae arose along with an increase in usage of both drugs. Decreasing prescription of cotrimoxazole was not reflected by decrease in resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Increasing prescriptions of tetracyclines were followed by an increasing resistance of E. coli, but not of Staphylococci. The oxacillin resistance of Staphylococcus epidermidis almost paralleled the consumption, the opposite was true for Staphylococcus aureus. There seemed to be a rather close relationship between the incidence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains and the quantities of gentamicin, tobramycin and azlocillin prescribed. The increase or decrease of prescriptions of certain antimicrobials increased or decreased their resistance rate to the respective drugs of only certain bacterial strains in one ICU, but not in the other. The findings in our hospital cannot necessarily be applied to other hospitals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - Use of rifampin for the treatment of serious staphylococcal and gram-negative bacillary infections.
AB  - The use of rifampin combined with other antimicrobial agents for the treatment of 40 serious bacterial infections against which other treatment regimens had failed was reviewed. Seven of 17 staphylococcal infections (16 due to Staphylococcus aureus and one due to Staphylococcus epidermidis) were cured, as were 16 of 23 infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. In vitro tests of interaction between rifampin and other antibiotics produced variable results. However, eight rifampin-resistant strains (six of S. aureus, one of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one of Proteus mirabilis) emerged during combination therapy in seven patients; the drugs involved were rifampin plus vancomycin in three instances, rifampin plus gentamicin in two, rifampin plus colistin in one, and rifampin plus pristinamycin in one. Thus, while rifampin produced a dramatic beneficial effect in some patients with serious bacterial infections, the emergence of resistant strains, even with dual drug therapy, was identified as a potential problem.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of hypertonic sucrose medium at a 1:5 ratio of blood to broth for detection of bacteremia and fungemia in supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - The value of hypertonic media in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia is controversial, since prior clinical trials have yielded conflicting results with different media. Earlier, we showed that the addition of 10% sucrose to supplemented peptone broth at a 1:10 ratio of blood to broth yielded better recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeasts. To evaluate the effect of 10% sucrose on blood cultured at a 1:5 ratio, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from adult patients in 5,839 blood samples cultured in supplemented peptone broth with 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate with and without 10% sucrose. The atmosphere of incubation (open venting units), 1:5 ratio of blood to broth, and methods of processing were the same for both bottles. Recovery of facultative gram-positive (P less than 0.02) and gram-negative (P less than 0.02) bacteria was improved, but the recovery of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria was both reduced (P less than 0.01) and delayed (P less than 0.02) by sucrose. The total yield of microorganisms including fungi, however, was increased with sucrose. The effect of sucrose on blood cultures appears to depend on the ratio of blood to broth as well as on the medium used and strains of microorganisms encountered.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin (MK366) against 477 aerobic gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates was compared to that of nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, ampicillin, cephalexin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and the combination trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Norfloxacin was more active than the other agents against all gram-negative organisms tested. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less than or equal to 0.125-32 mg/l with 90% inhibited (MIC90) by 4 mg/l; MICs of the Enterobacteriaceae including Serratia marcescens were less than or equal to 0.125-8 mg/l with an MIC90 of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. There was also excellent activity against the gram-positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the enterococci, with MICs less than or equal to 0.125-4 mg/l and an MIC90 less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Only 8 of 477 organisms were norfloxacin-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 16 mg/l): 3 of 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 of 10 Pseudomonas maltophilia and 2 of 15 Streptococcus bovis strains. In contrast, 97% of the gram-positive cocci and 49% of the gram-negative bacilli were nalidixic acid-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 32 mg/l). Norfloxacin shows excellent activity against a wide range of bacteria and merits further study as a urinary antibacterial agent.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of the new quinoline derivative ciprofloxacin (BAY 0 9867) was evaluated in comparison to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid using 495 clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The compound was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with MICs ranging from 0.008 mg/l to 4 mg/l, whereas the MICs of norfloxacin ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 16 mg/l. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were inhibited with a concentration of 2 mg/l ciprofloxacin and 32 mg/l norfloxacin. Ciprofloxacin was also active against gram-positive cocci. The MICs for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis ranged from 0.008 to 2.0 mg/l. The activity of ciprofloxacin was only slightly influenced by inoculum size, whereas an acid environment caused a noticeable decrease in the activity. Ciprofloxacin would seem to be a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of urinary tract infection.
TI  - The comparative activity of norfloxacin with other antimicrobial agents against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Norfloxacin (MK0366) displayed appreciable activity against the great majority of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (MIC90) of the Enterobacteriaceae was 0.5 mg/l or less while for Campylobacter, Neisseria, Haemophilus MIC90s were 0.25 mg/l or less. Norfloxacin was also among the most active drugs tested against methicillin susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, enterococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MIC90s between 0.5 and 4 mg/l.
TI  - Wound healing accelerated by Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - While comparing the effects on wound healing of a heated scalpel with those of the cold scalpel, we discovered that inoculation of rat skin incisions with a strain of Staphylococcus aureus dramatically accelerated the gain in wound strength. The accelerating effect was evident four days postoperatively, was maximal at seven to ten days, and was still present at 28 days. The accelerating effect was correlated with the number of S aureus organisms introduced into the wound, and was found in conventional rats and rats germ free up to the time of monocontamination with S aureus. There was no evidence of infection on gross examination; on histologic examination an occasional microabscess was seen in some rats. There may be both local and systemic mechanisms underlying the S aureus accelerating effect. Seven strains of S aureus with varying characteristics demonstrated the wound-healing accelerating effect. In sharp contrast, Staphylococcus epidermidis (three strains), Staphylococcus hominis (one strain), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two strains) did not show this effect. The increases in wound healing due to S aureus were substantially greater than reported previously for any nutritional supplement, drug, or other chemical or physical agent.
TI  - Treatment of serious infections with moxalactam.
AB  - In 93 hospitalized patients, 111 bacterial infections were treated with moxalactam. Eighty-three infections responded well to therapy, nine infections failed to respond to therapy or relapsed, and nine infections showed superinfection with resistant bacteria. The great majority of bacteria isolated had mean inhibitory concentrations below levels readily achieved in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, bile, abscess fluid, and peritoneal fluid. Among the commonly identified bacteria, only Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, and Staphylococcus epidermidis had variable sensitivity to moxalactam.
TI  - Comparison of the B-D urine culture kit with a standard culture method and with the MS-2.
AB  - A total of 100 random clinical urine specimens were divided and used to compare Becton, Dickinson & Co. B-D Urine Culture Kit-treated urine (BDU) with refrigerated urine (RU). Each RU-BDU pair was cultured with the standard calibrated loop-plate method and also screened with the Abbott Laboratories MS-2 system at 0, 5, and 24 h. An additional 158 positive urine specimens containing greater than 10(5) CFU/ml were tested by standard culturing and MS-2 at 0 and 24 h. In addition, growth curves were run for Escherichia coli containing RU-BDU pairs at 0 and 24 h, and MS-2 detection time frequencies were analyzed. Culture results showed few changes in colony counts at 0 and 5 h for RU and BDU specimens. At 24 h, there were decreased colony counts for 7.0% of RU and 17.7% of BDU specimens. MS-2 results showed detection rates at 0 h of 100% for RU and 82.9% for BDU specimens and at 24 h of 91.1% for RU and 63.3% for BDU specimens. The organisms most frequently missed at 24 h were E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Growth curve analysis showed a 1-h delay of logarithmic growth in BDU specimens. MS-2 detection time analysis showed delayed positive reports owing to be extended detection time for BDU specimens. The B-D Urine Culture Kit is a convenient transport system; however, some difficulty in recovering organisms at 24 h with the standard culture method and increased difficulty with the MS-2 system were recognized.
TI  - [Intrauterine bacterial and mycotic infections in cows].
AB  - Bacteriologic, mycologic, and serologic investigations of cows and calves and three experiments with rabbits were carried out to shed light on the bacteriology and mycology of the intrauterine infections in cows. The following organisms were isolated from the investigated cows that exhibited disturbances in their reproduction, and had abortions, or gave birth to calves that were affected with diseases or died: Escherichia coli (17.84%), association of bacteria (7.64%); Vibrio genitalis (3.86%); Streptococcus sp. (2.78%); moulds (2.54%); Staphylococcus aureus (2.20%); Proteus sp. (1.62%); Staphylococcus epidermidis (1.39%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.39%); Pasteurella multocida (0.11%). The serologic investigation of a total of 231 blood samples from cows that miscarried, gave birth to dead calves, or failed to conceive revealed that in 15.58 per cent there was vibriosis, and in 6.06 per cent--leptospirosis. Demonstrated was the etiologic link between cows with reproductive disturbances and diseased calves with regard to vibriosis and leptospirosis. The tests with rabbits were indicative of bacterial carriers (with special reference to the genitalia) up to the 60th day following infection. There were abortions, sterility, and death cases and the birth of unviable bunnies in the case of reproduced coital infections with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - Penetration of cefotaxime into the aqueous humour of the human eye after intravenous application.
AB  - The penetration of cefotaxime, a new semi-synthetic cephalosporin, into human aqueous humour was investigated. Doses of 1 g (17 patients) and 2 g (19 patients) were administered intravenously at time intervals varying from 45 min to 4 h prior to routine cataract surgery. After the 2 g dosage the average concentration of cefotaxime in the aqueous humour was higher (P less than 0.05) and lasted longer than after the 1 g dosage. The highest average concentration in the aqueous humour after the 1 g dosage was 1.85 microgram/ml, 3.95 micrograms/ml after the 2 g dosage. Therapeutic levels were consistently found in both groups for the organisms most commonly responsible for bacterial endophthalmitis, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxalactam against pathogenic bacteria and its comparison with other antibiotics.
AB  - 843 isolates from clinical specimens were tested against moxalactam by disc agar  diffusion. The bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group B and group D Streptococci. In vitro activity of moxalactam was compared with the following antibiotics: ampicillin, amikacin, carbenicillin, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, colistin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin, penicillin, tetracycline, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin. Of the 471 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 466 (98.9%) were susceptible to moxalactam. Except for penicillin G, the gram-positive cocci were generally more resistant to moxalactam than the other beta-lactam antibiotics. Moxalactam was comparable to gentamicin, as far as its activity against P. aeruginosa was concerned, but was less effective than amikacin, tobramycin, carbenicillin or colistin.
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221).
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefodizime (HR-221), a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was compared with the activities of selected antimicrobial agents against a broad spectrum of aerobic bacteria. Cefodizime concentrations of 2 micrograms/ml inhibited about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae studied. Serratia marcescens required 8 micrograms/ml to inhibit 90% of strains. Among gram-positive cocci, 50% of strains were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml of cefodizime (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefodizime. Cefotaxime, an antibiotic closely related to cefodizime structurally, was about fourfold more active.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of hypertonic sucrose medium for detection of bacteremia and fungemia in supplemented peptone broth.
AB  - Because the value of hypertonic media in detection of bacteremia and fungemia is  controversial, we evaluated supplemented peptone broth (SPB) with 0.03% sodium polyanetholsulfonate with and without 10% sucrose in 5,439 paired blood cultures from adult patients. The aerobic atmosphere, 1:10 ratio of blood to broth, and methods for processing blood cultures were identical. Only cultures with adequate blood samples (greater than or equal to 4 ml) were compared statistically. More clinically important bacteria were recovered from SPB with sucrose (P less than or equal to 0.001), including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Bacteroidaceae. However, only one of nine isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae grew in SPB with sucrose. Staphylococci (P less than 0.001), Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.01), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than 0.01), and yeasts (P less than 0.05) were detected 1 or more days earlier in SPB with sucrose. The effect of sucrose on blood cultures appears to be medium dependent, based on comparisons of our results with those of published reports.
TI  - Broviac catheter-related bacteremia in oncology patients.
AB  - In 27 pediatric oncology patients (median age, 2 years) undergoing chemotherapy for malignant tumours, Silastic Broviac catheters were placed to provide vascular access. The catheters were in place for a total of 174 patient-months. There were 14 episodes of Broviac catheter-related bacteremia or fungemia that occurred in six patients: one patient had six bacteremic episodes, one patient had four episodes, and four patients each had one bacteremic episode. Cultures of blood drawn from Broviac catheter were positive in all instances, and in 12 of 14 samples drawn from the peripheral vein. The most common initial symptoms were fever and chills. The species causing the infections were Enterobacter cloacae (three cases), Staphylococcus epidermidis (three cases), Staphylococcus aureus (three cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (two cases), Escherichia coli (two cases), Pseudomonas dentrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida tropicalis. Antimicrobials administered through the catheter cured the infection in ten of the 11 cases in which they were used.
TI  - Evaluation of three methods for detecting low-level bacterial contamination in intravenous solutions.
AB  - The accuracy of three sterility-testing methods in detecting low-level contamination in deliberately contaminated intravenous solutions was studied. One-liter bags of 5% dextrose (D5W) and 0.9% sodium chloride (saline injections were contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; approximately 10(1) viable bacteria were injected into each bag. Two membrane-filtration methods (Ivex-2 and Addi-Chek) and one aliquot method [twice concentrated trypic soy broth (2X-TSB)] were used to test each of 10 diliberately contaminated solutions for both D5W and saline; 500 ml of each liter bag was filtered or added to 2X-TSB. Incubation containers were stored at 37 degrees C and inspected at 24, 48, and 72 hours for turbidity. There was no significant difference among the three methods in the detection of contaminated saline solutions. The Addi-Chek system was significantly less effective in detecting contamination in D5W than either of the other methods. It is concluded that the Ivex-2 system is accurate and the easiest-to-use system of the three tested.
TI  - Comparative synergistic activity of netilmicin-piperacillin versus gentamicin-piperacillin.
AB  - The synergistic action of the combination netilmicin-piperacillin in comparison to gentamicin-piperacillin was studied in 206 clinical isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by means of the checkerboard technique. Overall, netilmicin-piperacillin acted synergistically against 31% and gentamicin-piperacillin against 14% of the 206 strains. In particular, synergism was more frequently observed with netilmicin-piperacillin against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Synergy was uncommon with either combination against enterococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Serratia spp. Only partial synergy or indifference was seen with both combinations against Klebsiella spp. The interaction of netilmicin would appear to be superior to that of gentamicin in combination with piperacillin.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of E-0702, a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  - E-0702 is an antipseudomonal cephalosporin derivative which has a broad spectrum  of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Its in vitro antibacterial activities were less than those of cefoperazone and cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, but were significantly high against gram-negative bacteria including the Pseudomonas group. It was most characteristic that E-0702 showed high antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. E-0702 was relatively stable to inactivation by plasmid-mediated penicillinases and cephalosporinases produced by gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Aetiology and treatment of acute bacterial infection of the external eye.
AB  - The microbial flora of 738 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis, corneal  ulceration, blepharitis, dacryocystitis, and discharging sockets has been investigated. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae were the main pathogens isolated. Str. viridans was associated with conjunctivitis in patients aged under 1 year. moraxella sp. was isolated on only one occasion. Overall, 40% of specimens were associated with Staph. epidermidis or mixed skin flora, which also occurred with cultures of the normal eye. Clostridium welchii was isolated on 3 occasions but was not associated with bullae or gas gangrene. The least overall resistance, of 6%, was to chloramphenicol, but no one antibiotic was effective against all pathogens. Gentamicin remains the antibiotic of choice for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.
TI  - Activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin and cephalosporins against isolates from nosocomially acquired bacteremia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was compared with that of seven beta-lactam agents against bacteremic clinical isolates, including gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, and enterococci. N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active antibiotic against all of the gram-positive cocci studied, with the exception of Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the only agent active against the enterococci. N-formimidoyl thienamycin was less active than some of the other agents against Enterobacteriaceae, except for the strains of Serratia and Citrobacter studied. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was the most active agent (4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that inhibited 90% of the strains tested).
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - [Hygienic and microbiological influences exerted on natural water biotopes by algae and the growth of water plants. 1. Communication: antibacterial properties of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth-inhibiting behaviour of abacterial, liquid pure cultures made up of three water algae (Hydrodictyon reticulatum, Chlorella vulgaris, Aphanothece nidulans) which were made to grow profusely in special culture containers under constant exposure to light and ventilation was examined in ten different species of microorganisms during a period of contact of 4 days both in the light and in the dark. Subjected to the test were the 5 pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Candida albicans as well the 5 bacterial contamination indicators E. coli (faecal indicator), Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci), Enterobacter aerogenes ("coliforms"), Staphylococcus epidermidis (dermic germ) and Bacillus subtilis ("contamination germ"). It was found that --Hydrodictyon reticulatum and Aphanothece nidulans exert a strong antibacterial effect, while Chlorella vulgaris provides no indication of a bacterial growth-inhibiting effect. --this antibiosis is linked with the assimilative activity of the algal cultures, as in the dark no antibacterial action is discernible --the "antibiotic principle" must be liable to transitory or rapid disintegration because the algal cultures are ineffective in the dark and also culture filtrates of 5-days old algal cultures exercise no growth-inhibiting effect. With respect to the sanitation of waters it is important to state that a profuse growth of algae produces a certain, but hardly reliable "biological water disinfection" and renders difficult the assessment of the quality of a water-course as a result of the elimination of the usual contamination indicators. Therefore, additional microbiological quality parameters must be used for assessment of pollution of swimming pools with strong algal growth.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on ceftizoxime in otorhinolaryngological field (author's transl)].
AB  - From the laboratory and clinical studies on ceftizoxime (CZX), the following results were obtained 1) CZX was compared with cefazolin (CEZ) for in vitro activity against 6 standard strains and clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (19 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (14), Proteus sp. (17), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella sp. (3) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13). While somewhat less active against Gram-positive cocci than CEZ, CZX was far more active than CEZ against Gram-negative bacilli. 2) The time course of mean serum CZX levels in 2 patients given a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg was as follows: 24.9 microgram/ml at 15 minutes, 18.5 microgram/ml at 30 minutes, 13.2 microgram/ml at 1 hour, 6.4 microgram/ml at 2 hours and 2.7 microgram/ml at 4 hours. The mean serum half life was 1.36 hours. The mean tonsil concentrations of CZX 30 minutes after a single intravenous dose of 0.5 g and 1.0 g were 5.9 microgram/g and 9.6 microgram/g. respectively, with the ratio to the serum concentration of 0.33 and 0.32. 3) CZX was given to 28 patients with ear, nose, and throat infections, and overall rate of effectiveness was 92.3%. No clinical side effects were observed. Changes in laboratory test findings included slightly elevated GOT and/or GPT in 3 cases.
TI  - [Microbial population of the preputial sac in young bulls].
AB  - The microbial population of the praeputial sac was studied in a group of ten young bulls housed in one section of the rearing farm in the age period from 2 to 14 months when they were transferred to A. I. stations. As to currently occurring microflora, Proteus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated most frequently. The remaining micro-organisms isolated during the study included E. coli, non-haemolytic and viridizing streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococci, aerobic sporulating bacteria, saprophytic corynebacteria snd gamma-negative non-fermenting rods. Campylobacter foetus subsp. foetus was not detected and the same applies to the other species of this genus (Campylobacter sp.). When the bullocks were transferred to the rearing farm, the mycoplasms were no longer isolated from the praeputial mucous membrane. Mycoplasms were determined in all the studied animals after six months' stay in group. The isolated strains were identified as M. bovigenitalium by the epiimmunofluorescence method.
TI  - Increased serum antibacterial activity after turpentine-induced acute inflammation.
AB  - An acute inflammatory response was induced in rabbits by an intramuscular injection of turpentine. After this injection serial serum samples were obtained and serum haptoglobin levels were monitored. In addition, increased antibacterial activity was measured using a viable plate and photometric growth assay. As early as 4 hrs after turpentine challenge an increase was noted in serum antibacterial activity towards Staphylococcus aureus. At 48 hrs pronounced killing activity was demonstrated against S. aureus and S. epidermidis but not against Escherichia coli or other gram negative bacilli. By five days another serum bactericidal activity was present against Bacillus subtilis. Enhanced serum antibacterial activity persisted for 2 weeks. Partial characterization of these factors indicates that they are probably beta lysins.
TI  - Comparison of two methods for detecting microbial contamination in intravenous fluids.
AB  - An aliquot sampling method and a qualitative membrane filltration method of microbial detection in intravenous infusion solutions were compared. One-liter plastic bags of total parenteral nutrition solutions were contaminated at approximately 1000, 100, 10, and 1 organisms per liter using clinically isolated strains of Escheichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Candida albicans. Ten-milliliter aliquots of the solutions were injected into blood culture bottles to test the aliquot method. All remaining fluid was filtered through the Addi-Chek system to test the filtration method. Samples were incubated at 30 degrees C for 10 days and inspected daily for turbidity. The aliquot sampling method consistently detected each of the four organisms at levels of 100 organisms/liter and above. The membrane filtration method consistently detected all levels of contamination (as few as four organisms/liter). The aliquot sampling method is inexpensive and easy to use but may fail to detect some contaminated solutions. The qualitative membrane filtration system will detect all levels of contamination but is more costly in both time and money, and its reliability has not been assessed objectively.
TI  - Survival of bacteria after freezing of human semen in liquid nitrogen.
AB  - Thirty-four semen samples from fertile men were subjected to bacteriologic evaluation before and after freezing to -196 degrees C using 10% glycerol as the protective medium. Cultures of the fresh portions from all ejaculates examined showed the presence of aerobic bacteria. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium sp., alpha-streptococci, and nonhemolytic streptococci were found so commonly that they were considered commensals. Enterococci, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci group B, as well as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. maltophilia, and P. fluorescens, were also recovered from a few semen samples of these fertile men. Practically all bacteria isolated from the fresh ejaculate were also recovered from the portions frozen in liquid nitrogen.
TI  - [Epidemiology of nosocomial septicemia (author's transl)].
AB  - During recent decades the incidence of nosocomial septicemia has considerably increased. From 1976--1980 on average 0.6% of 39, 802 prospectively analyzed hospital patients acquired septicemia. The risk of acquiring nosocomial septicemia in intensive care units is 10 times higher than in general wards. The risk is highest in medical and surgical intensive care units. Most common bacteria causing nosocomial septicemia were: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Nosocomial pneumonia, wound infections and venous catheter infections most often lead to septicemia. In half the patients with septicemia the infection either directly caused death or contributed to the death of the patient. The hospital costs for patients with septicemia are twice as high as for patients with the same underlying disease without septicemia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a beta-lactamase-stable cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of S. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but Streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less than 0.1 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most Enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against Proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. Ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against Bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Presence of serum, alteration of pH, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels. Bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. Ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some Enterobacter, Proteus, and Bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.
TI  - Microbiological studies of the bacterial flora of the external auditory canal in  children.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the external auditory canal (EAC) was studied in 72 children. Aerobes only were isolated in 58 patients (80%) and anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (3%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered in 12 cases (17%). There were 122 aerobic and 15 anaerobic isolates accounting for 1.7 aerobes and 0.2 anaerobes per specimen. The most common aerobic isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis (56 isolates), alpha hemolytic streptococcus (13) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8). The two anaerobic organisms recovered were Proprionibacterium acnes (13 isolates) and Peptococcus sp. (2). These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacterial flora of EAC in children where aerobic facultative and anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) against resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The in vitro activities of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) and nine other antibiotics were tested against 129 clinical isolates, including 71 of enterococci, 34 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 17 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 7 of Serratia marcescens. These isolates exhibited a variety of resistant patterns: 97% of the enterococci were resistant to moxalactam; 71 and 81% of the S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to methicillin and penicillin, respectively; 47, 53, and 53% of the P. aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbenicillin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam, respectively; and all S. marcescens isolates were resistant to amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. With respect to concentrations required to inhibit growth of 90% of the isolates, N-formimidoyl thienamycin was more active than any compound tested. Determination of the concentration required to inhibit growth of 50% of the isolates showed N-formimidoyl thienamycin to be more active than any other agent against S. epidermidis, S. marcescens, and enterococci, but against Pseudomonas isolates it was less active than amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. This preparation is potentially useful for patients with serious infection caused by resistant bacteria; enterococcal and S. epidermidis endocarditis infections may be special situations which merit clinical trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787), a crystalline derivative of thienamycin.
AB  - N-Formimidoyl thienamycin (MK0787) is a derivative of thienamycin, a unique, new  beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 285 aerobic and facultatively anaerobic clinical isolates was compared with the activities of cephalothin, ampicillin, penicillin G, ticarcillin, and tobramycin. All of the 285 isolates, with the exception of 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin of less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50% of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl thienamycin tested (0.125 micrograms/ml); 98% of Staphylococcus aureus and 80% of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl thienamycin at a concentration of 0.125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli. It inhibited more than 95% of the gram-negative isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin was as active or more active than tobramycin against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis and substantially more active than ticarcillin. All 16 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms of N-formimidoyl thienamycin per ml. The marked in vitro activity of this drug against a wide variety of clinical isolates makes it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Qualitative and quantitative methods of studying the effect of lipids on bacteria grown on the surface of solid culture media.
AB  - New qualitative and quantitative methods are described for the investigation of the antibacterial activity of lipids on solid media by the application of lipid-impregnated filter paper over a lawn of the organisms. The methods have been used to investigate the antibacterial activity of unsaturated fatty acids that are important in skin defence. Oleic and linoleic acids inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes markedly, Staphylococcus aureus and Staph epidermidis to a lesser extent and had no effect on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The inhibition of growth of a strain of Str. pyogenes from a sore throat was greater than that of a strain from an outbreak of impetigo. Linoleic acid was a more potent inhibitor of bacterial growth than oleic acid, and with both acids inhibition was more pronounced under aerobic than under anaerobic conditions of incubation. The methods described could be applied in other fields such as pharmacology, horticulture and industry.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Potential of mezlocillin as empiric single-agent therapy in febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients.
AB  - Mezlocillin was used as an initial empiric antibiotic therapy for febrile (> 101  degrees F, ca. 38.33 degrees C) granulocytopenic (< 1,000/microliter) cancer patients. Patients known to be colonized with an organism resistant to 100 micrograms of mezlocillin per mol were excluded. The initial 25 cases (23 patients) received intravenous mezlocillin, 260 mg per kg per day in six divided doses; the mean 1-h-postinfusion serum level was 69 micrograms/ml. Because of the low serum level, the next 25 cases (22 patients) received 450 mg/kg per day, also in six divided doses, resulting in a mean 1-h-postinfusion serum level of 161 micrograms/ml. Both dosage regimens provided similar efficacy. Combined results show that 11 of 21 microbiologically documented infections and 7 of 13 clinically documented infections improved. Instances of bacteremia (number of cases in parentheses) were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two), Staphylococcus epidermidis (two), Clostridia perfringens (one), and Bacillus species (one); only one case improved. A rise in granulocyte count to > 500/microliters, a serum bactericidal activity of greater than or equal to 1:8 against the infecting pathogen, or both were indicators of a good therapeutic response. Despite exclusion of patients known to be previously colonized with mezlocillin-resistant organisms, 7 of 23 pathogens required a minimal concentration of greater than or equal to 100 micrograms of mezlocillin per ml for inhibition. In addition, surveillance cultures from 18 cases showed resistant organisms colonizing the gingiva, rectum, or both. Side effects of mezlocillin were minimal and included pseudoproteinuria, asymptomatic transient rise in bilirubin, and easily reversible kypokalemia. Mezlocillin, a new semisynthetic penicillin with little toxicity, was found to be inadequate as a single-agent empiric antibiotic therapy for febrile, granulocytopenic cancer patients.
TI  - Treatment failures secondary to in vivo development of drug resistance by microorganisms.
AB  - In two patients development of resistance to antibiotics by initially sensitive infecting organisms was associated with relapse or persistence of active infection. The first patient developed Staphylococcus epidermidis resistant to chloramphenicol during therapy with this agent for an infection that followed a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, and the second patient developed bacteremia due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella during therapy with ampicillin. Treatment failure resulting from in vivo development of resistance to antimicrobial agents has been described for most of the major classes of antiinfective drugs and for numerous microorganisms. Although in many of these instances reinfection with a resistant organism cannot be excluded, there are many examples of apparent mutation or initial infection with both sensitive and resistant bacterial populations that is followed by selective multiplication of the resistant population or acquisition of resistance by an initially sensitive infecting organism. This phenomenon can be a cause of treatment failure and has appeared in patients in whom, by available tests, drug levels were found adequate. Isolation days after the institution of antimicrobial therapy of what appears to be the same organism as was initially recovered should prompt repeated sensitivity tests, at least to the agents being administered, if the patient's clinical course has not been one of satisfactory improvement.
TI  - Loss of effectiveness of preservative systems of mascaras with age.
AB  - The preservative systems of unused, anhydrous mascaras were challenged periodically with microorganisms, using a modified membrane procedure. Shelf life of preservative activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa varied for different brands from as little as 1 month to over 36 months. Generally, P. aeruginosa grew in mascaras after the mascaras were challenged first with Staphylococcus epidermidis or Candida albicans.
TI  - Intravenous cefotaxime in children with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Thirteen children with meningitis due to Haemophilus influenzae, beta-haemolytic  streptococcus group B, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and who had been unsuccessfully treated with other antibiotics or had causative organisms which were resistant to available antibiotics were treated with intravenous cefotaxime. Nine children were cured; in one case infection (with a different organism) recurred but a further course of cefotaxime was successful; one child died, with sterile CSF; one child died from his underlying disease (astrocytoma); and one child was cured with sequelae (hydrocephalus). A further child with meningitis caused by E. coli had been treated unsuccessfully by intravenous and intraventricular chloramphenicol and gentamicin; intravenous and intraventricular cefotaxime was successful. The agent was well tolerated. CSF levels were measured in seven children and ranged from 300 to 27 200 microgram/l; published and unpublished in-vitro studies suggest that minimum inhibitory concentrations for cefotaxime against the organisms commonly causing bacterial meningitis are usually well below 250 microgram/l.
TI  - Bacterial colonization in intubated newborns.
AB  - The bacteriology of tracheal aspirates from 127 newborns was studied. Specimens were obtained twice a week as long as the newborns were intubated. Each newborn had between one and eight specimens taken (average 1.7). 127 babies had one specimen taken, 38 had two, 25 had three, 12 had four, and 10 had more than four specimens taken, which made a total of 212 specimens. No bacterial or fungal growth was obtained from 65 specimens, whereas the remaining specimens (147) yielded 209 bacterial and fungal isolates accounting for 1.4 isolates per specimen. The total isolates recovered were 168 aerobes, 36 anaerobes, and 5 Candida albicans. Of this total, 70 specimens yielded one isolate, 48 two isolates, 6 three isolates, 5 four isolates, and one aspirate yielded five isolates. 78 newborns (61%) received antimicrobial therapy. A higher incidence of positive cultures and the presence of more than one organism per culture were found in those infants not receiving antibiotics. More isolates per specimen were noted with increasing time of incubation. The rate of isolation Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae remained constant with increased length of intubation, the rate of recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, viridans group streptococci, and Propionibacterium acnes increased, and the rate of isolation of Escherichia coli and anaerobic organisms decreased.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of heparin.
AB  - Single clinical isolates of eight species of microorganisms were incubated in solutions of heparin and brain heart infusion broth at various concentrations to determine the possible antibacterial effect of heparin. At heparin concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 400 U/ml, the effect on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis varied with brain heart infusion broth concentrations of 1.2 to 10% and inocula of 10(2) to 10(6) colony-forming units per ml; similar effects were not observed with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Citrobacter spp. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of heparin for ten strains of each species were determined in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth with inocula of 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. All 10 isolates of S. aureus and all 10 of S. epidermidis were inhibited by heparin concentrations of 125 to 500 U/ml. Three E. coli, four P. aeruginosa, and nine C. albicans strains were inhibited by </=500 U of heparin per ml. None of the K. pneumoniae, E. aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter spp. was inhibited by heparin at </=500 U/ml. Heparin inhibition of S. aureus in 2.5% brain heart infusion broth-500 U of heparin per ml could be quantitatively overcome by addition of magnesium, calcium, or magnesium and calcium. These data suggest that the growth of microorganisms from heparin-containing material may be suppressed.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new semisynthetic cephalosporin: cefoperazone.
AB  - Cefoperazone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with excellent antibacterial activity. This study included more than 1,500 clinical isolates whose susceptibility to cefoperazone was determined by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). Cefoperazone was highly active against Enterobacteriaceae including indolepositive Proteus, Serratia and Enterobacter sp. Particularly noteworthy was the high activity of cefoperazone against Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter strains, which are usually resistant to first- and second-generation cephalosporins. The activity of cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci and Haemophilus was also determined. In general, the differences between MIC and MBC were minimal. Additional studies were carried out to determine the effect of inoculum size on cefoperazone activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a new 1-oxa cephalosporin compared with that of other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  - The in vitro activity of (6R,7R)-7-{[carboxy(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl]amino}-7-methoxy-3-[[(1-methyl -1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thio]methyl]-8-oxo-5-oxa-1-azabicyclo-[4.2.0]oct-2-ene -2-carboxylic acid was tested against isolates of gram-positive and negative bacteria and compared with those of cephalothin, cefuroxime, cefamandole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and carbenicillin. The compound was less active than the other compounds when tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. It had equal or slightly less activity than did cefotaxime when tested against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, but was 8- to 32-fold more active than the other cephalosporins against the Enterobacteriaceae, inhibiting most isolates at concentrations less than 0.5 mug/ml. The compound was twofold more active than cefotaxime and cefoxitin against Bacteroides, and it was twofold more active than cefotaxime and fourfold more active than carbenicillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro activity did not correlate with either the presence or type of beta-lactamase in either Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas. The compound showed minimal synergy when combined with aminoglycosides or carbenicillin.
TI  - Gentamicin resistance in Christchurch hospitals.
AB  - Prior to June 1976, the isolation of gentamicin resistant organisms was an infrequent occurrence in North Canterbury Hospital Board institutions. During July 1976, 20 different gentamicin resistant organisms were isolated from patients in Christchurch Hospital. Gentamicin resistant organisms hav e been continually isolated from an increasingly wide area since then. The organisms involved are: providence species; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Klebsiella species; E coli; Staphyloccus aureus; Proteus mirabilis; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Acinetobacter species; Enterobacter species; Haemophilus influenzae; Pseudomonas maltophilia CDC II F; Citrobacter species; Alcaligenes odorans and Pseudomonas species. The spread of gentamicin resistant organisms has occurred rapidly in the hospital environment. The importance of the urinary tract as a reservoir of microorganisms is indicated in this report.
TI  - Storage of microtiter plates for antimicrobial susceptibility tests.
AB  - Microdilution susceptibility tests are being performed routinely and in increasing numbers in many clinical laboratories. Microtiter plates for these assays are usually prepared in large batches and stored frozen until needed. Studies were performed to investigate the stability at -20C and at -70C of ampicillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, chloramphenicol, and cephalothin, using Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella as test organisms. The stability at -20C and -70C of clindamycin, vancomycin, cephalothin, cefazolin, oxacillin, methicillin, nafcillin, and penicillin was analyzed using Staphylococcus eureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, and alpha Streptococcus as the test organisms. No significant deterioration of any of the antibiotics was noted after ten weeks of storage at -70C, as detected by minimum inhibitory concentration determinations. No significant differences were noted at -20C for clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, cefazolin, cephalothin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin. By ten weeks' storage at -20C, significant deterioration of carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, penicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, and nafcillin was observed.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - [Comparison of disinfectant activity of 3 different embalming fluids on cadavera  for anatomical study (author's transl)].
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of 3 different embalming fluids (Phenol/Formaline, JORES 1913 TUTSCH 1975) was evaluated from the beginning of the conservation process through storage in a new system (TUTSCH et al. 1971) and the subsequent dissection course. Endogenous bacteria are significantly reduced 24 hours after injection. Later on during the storage period of at least 6 months no germs are detected in swabs from orifices whereas Staphylococcus epidermidis and aerobic sporeforming bacteria were found on the surfaces of the bodies in some cases. The formula of the disinfectant (Phenol/Formaline or Merfen according to NEUMANN 1974) in the storage system appears to be of no significance. During dissection as a rule Staphylococcus epidermidis and a few aerobic sporeformers were found on the surface of specimens, at one time Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultivated too. Swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from contents of the intestine were sterile. Investigations by broth dilution method were carried out in order to evaluate the degree of bacteriostatic activity of the various fluids in use. This method is now routinely used for control of the disinfectants in the storage system.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Ocular flora in the severely burned patient.
AB  - One hundred six eyes of 53 patients with severe thermal burns were studied with serial conjunctival cultures during a four-month period. A dramatic shift of the normal conjunctival flora from the preponderance of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Corynebacterium to S aureus and Gram-negative bacilli was observed. This commonly occurred on the fifth to sixth postburn day and represented colonization of the conjunctiva by bacteria recovered from other sites in the body. Despite the high incidence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (34%) of these eyes, deleterious effects were noted in only three eyes in two patients in whom infectious corneal ulcers developed before these patients died.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - Endocarditis related to transvenous pacemakers. Syndromes and surgical implications.
AB  - Two cases of microbial endocarditis related to transvenous pacemakers illustrate  syndromes whose pathogenesis we consider to be distinctive. Acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa endocarditis related to a pacemaker developed in a 75-year-old man, an event which to our knowledge has not been previously described. There was no evidence of generator site infection, and the sequence of events indicated metastatic implantation of bacteria on traumatized endothelium. A 76-year-old women with a 3 year history of local generator site infection and recurrent fever was found to have extensive vegatative Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis at cardiotomy. The sequence of events indicated gradual spread of infection locally, related to the contaminated foreign body. Awareness of these separate pathogenetic mechanisms should facilitate recognition and appropriate management. Removal of the entire pacing system and prolonged antibiotic therapy were considered to be essential to cure of infection in both instances.
TI  - Immunohistochemical localization of a choriogonadotropin-like protein in bacteria isolated from cancer patients.
AB  - By the use of specific antibody to human chorionic gonadotropin (CG) as well as to its beta-subunit, and the application of the indirect fluorescein-labeled and peroxidase-labeled antibody techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of a membrane (wall)-associated CG-similar immunoreactive protein in 15 strains of bacteria isolated from tissues of patients bearing malignant neoplasms. These microorganisms were classified as S. epidermidis, (12) E. coli (2), and a single strain of P. maltophilia (ATCC 13637). The absence of the CG-like antigen in other "cancer associated bacteria", Streptococcus faecalis (ATCC 12818) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (from patient with cancer of colon), demonstrated that not every "cancer associated bacteria" has the capability to synthesize the trophoblastic-like protein. The negative results obtained with a number of "noncancer control" bacteria of known origin, obtained from ATCC and from clinical samples, strongly supported the idea that the existance of these CG-like protein producing microorganisms is not a ubiquitous finding. The demonstration of a de novo bacterial biosynthesis of a protein having similar antigenic and biophysical properties to those of the human trophoblastic hormone, has great biological implications, especially if its biosynthesis is proven only in bacterial strains growing in the presence of cancer cells in which we have already demonstrated the presence of a similar antigen. The explanation of the phenomenon is unknown. Because of their origin, the potential of "genetic exchange" with subsequent expression of the mammalian gene by the bacterial cells becomes a possibility. It is also possible that the gene coding for the CG-like protein is normally present but inactive or repressed in all bacteria.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of five nitrofurans.
AB  - Five nitrofurans- nitrofurantoin, nifuratel, nitrofurazone, furazolidone and and  SQ 18,506--have been tested against 201 microbial strains. Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, micrococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis were sensitive to all five compounds; furazolidone and SQ 18,506 were the most active against these species. Klebsiella aerogenes was less sensitive, and Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant. Nifuratel was inhibitory for some Candida albicans strains, and SQ 18,506 was highly active against this species. Nifuratel was judged overall to have superior in vitro antimicrobial properties to nitrofurantoin.
TI  - [Resistance of pyogenic bacteria during a period of five years (author's transl)].
AB  - The bacteriological results of 4113 clinical specimens (wound-swabs) were analysed. In 40 per cent of positive findings Staphylococcus aureus was isolated, furthermore, in decreasing frequency Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococci and haemolysing Streptococci. During this study a considerable quota of the examined strains was observed to show large fluctuation in sensitivity, but more than half of the isolates demonstrated increasing resistance against the chemotherapeutics tested. In order to reduce the development of resistance, our results ascertain the necessity for a scientific antibacterial therapy as well as the strict observance of hospital hygienic measures.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of Proteus, Pseudomonas pyocyanea and staphyloccoci isolated from scleroma and ozena patients].
AB  - Antibiotic sensitivity of 292 strains of Proteus, 60 strains of Ps, aeruginosa, 309 strains of S. aureus and 88 strains of S. epidermidis isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients with scleroma and ozena was studied. The cultures of Pr. mirabilis were sensitive to aminoglucosides (54.9-96.2 per cent) and Pr. morganii were sensitive to levomycetin (81.5 per cent) and neomycin (92.6 per cnet). Sensitivity of Pr. vulgaris and Pr. morganii was reliably higher (p less than 0.001) than that of Pr. mirabilis. The strains of Pr. morganii were less sensitive to monomycin (P less than 0.001) and streptomycin (p less than 0.01) as compared to the cultures of other Proteus species tested. The strains of Ps. aeruginosa were sensitive only to gentamicin (90 per cent) and neomycin (81.1 per cent). Most of the strains of S. aureus (85.4-100 per cent) were sensitive to oleadomycin, erythromycin, olemorphocycline, tetraolean, oxacillin, methicillin ceporin, lincomycin, ristomycin, kanamycin, monomycin and gentamicin. Benzylpenicillin (90.8 per cent of the sensitive strains), ampicillin (67.1 per cent), tetracycline (66.7 per cent), levomycetin (68.6 per cent) and streptomycin (38.1 per cent) were less effective. Antibacterial therapy in cases with scleroma and ozena should be directed not only against causative agents of the diseases but also against the microbes developing due to disbacteriosis. Combination of parenteral and local use of the antibiotics in the treatment of chronic clebsiellesis decreased the isolation rate of Proteus and Ps. aeruginosa in the patients.
TI  - [Characteristics of the increased resistance of mice to Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused by Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Mice were protected against a lethal dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a previous sublethal infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Under similar conditions, Staphylococcus epidermidis afforded only slight protection. The following characteristics of this increased resistance that we have observed are (1) survival of mice, and decrease of the number of viable units of P. aeruginosa in the peritoneal cavity of the same mice infected with S. aureus coagulase-positive strains, either from our laboratory collection or from hospital cases, when the time interval between the injection with staphylococci and that of P. aeruginosa was between 4 and 96 h; (2) absence of a net inhibitory effect in vitro on P. aeruginosa with serum from mice infected with a sublethal dose of coagulase-positive S. aureus; (3) changes in the appearance of peritoneal exudate cells after infection with a sublethal dose of S. aureus; P. aeruginosa injected afterwards in the peritoneal cavity of mice was eliminated; when P. aeruginosa was injected alone, "activated macrophages" were not observed and bacterial cells were present in large numbers in the exudate. The immunostimulation induced by a previous sublethal injection of S. aureus coagulase-positive strains seemed to be inhibited by the immunosuppressive drug cyclophosphamide, since mice were no longer protected against a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa. Cell immunity may intervene in such infections with opportunistic species and check the invasiveness of a gram-negative bacterium superinfecting a host already exposed to coagulase-positive S. aureus.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative activity in vitro of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin.
AB  - The activity of ticarcillin, BL-P1654, and carbenicillin was compared in vitro using a microtiter tube dilution test in Mueller-Hinton broth against 50 recent clinical isolates each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Enterobacter species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal end points were determined using a modified Steers replicator. Ticarcillin was generally two to four times more active against all organisms tested except S. epidermidis against which BL-P1654 was most active. Median minimum inhibitory concentrations in micrograms per milliliter were for S. aureus: ticarcillin (6.2), carbenicillin (12.5), BL-P1654 (25); for S. epidermidis: BL-P1654 (1.6), ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (3.2); for E. coli: ticarcillin (3.2), BL-P1654 (6.2), carbenicillin (6.2); for Klebsiella sp.: >100 for all three drugs; for Enterobacter sp.: ticarcillin (3.2), carbenicillin (6.2), BL-P1654 (12.5); for Proteus sp.: ticarcillin (1.6), carbenicillin (1.6), BL-P1654 (3.2); for P. aeruginosa: ticarcillin (31), BL-P1654 (62), carbenicillin (125). Bactericidal end points were dependent on both the drug and the species but were in general no more than twofold more than the minimum inhibitory concentration with the exception of BL-P1654 against P. aeruginosa. BL-P1654 was bactericidal for only 60% of the strains tested at a concentration of 500 mug/ml.
TI  - The fate of bacteria in frozen red cells.
AB  - Units of blood were intentionally contaiminated with suspensions of either Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Sarcina lutea, Seratia marcesens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Paracolabacterum aerogenoides (Enterobacter hafriae), Mima polymorpha or Acinetobacter- calcoaceticus. When inoculation was made prior to glycerolization, the subsequent glycerolization, freezing, thawing, and deglycerolization resulted in roughly a two log reduction in the number of bacteria. When inoculation was made with a final concentration of between 10(1) and 10(5) organisms per milliliter, immediately following deglycerolization or following washing without glycerolization and freezing, no increase in the number of bacteria was seen after 72 hours storage at 4 C. Three of the 12 organisms studied decreased in number during 72 hours of storage. These data suggest that the current 24-hour limit on the post-thaw storage of frozen red blood cells may be unnecessarily restrictive.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Meatal recolonization in bitches.
AB  - Colonization of the urethrovaginal area precedes urinary tract infection in women. Among the potential factors limiting colonization by fecal pathogens is bacterial interference, the ability of established commensals to inhibit colonization by pathogenic bacteria. Since the microcontour of the canine distal urethra possesses microvilli like those in the vagina rather than the microplicae found at higher levels and also has similarities in cellular glycogen content the meatal area would be expected to respond to hormonal influences like the vagina. The normal canine urethrovaginal flora was determined by serial cultures. It consisted principally of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Corynebacterium and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. Estrus produced a selective overgrowth of beta-Streptococcus and Acinetobacter-Haemophilus. A normal canine transient, Escherichia coli, and a normal resident, Corynebacterium, persisted only for a short time (4.5 days) unless inoculated during estrus, when they remained for a mean period of 70 days. In contrast, human Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas persisted only a short time, whether during anestrus (4.8 days) or during estrus (8.5 days). The commensals had returned fully by 14 days after sterilization, while those in estrus overresponded. Thus, indigenous bacteria inhibit establishment of certain foreign species in the urethra and hormones enhance the susceptibility to colonization.
TI  - Partial characterisation of an inhibitor of streptolysin O produced by bacterial  growth in serum.
AB  - An inhibitor of streptolysin O is generated in human and animal sera by the growth of certain organisms. The ability to do this occurs most often in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (in 90% and 86% of strains respectively), but in only 32% of Staph. epidermidis strains. The inhibitor is not formed in broth. The effect appears slowly on incubation, with maximum activity after 4-7 days. Evidence suggests that two enzymes are involved, an esterase which splits ester-bound cholesterol and a proteolytic enzyme which partially hydrolyses lipoprotein, resulting in cholesterol remaining attached to protein or polypeptide fractions but with some alteration of its spatial configuration such that it is now capable of attaching to streptolysin O. The inhibitory factor appears to prevent streptolysin becoming attached to cholesterol receptor sites on the erythrocyte membrane. Removal of the precursor from serum with magnesium carbonate suggests that low-density lipoproteins may be the precursor of the inhibitor.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - The effectiveness of various antibiotics in methyl methacrylate.
AB  - The effectiveness of different antibiotics mixed with Simplex P has been tested in vitro. A laboratory model was designed to simulate the constant immersion of bone cement in tissue fluid. Clindamycin, and to a lesser extent Cephalothin, were shown to be effective when used in this manner against Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis. Effective inhibition of Gram-negative organisms could not be demonstrated with any of the antibiotics tested. The addition of up to 3 grams of antibiotic powder per unit of 40 grams of Simplex P did not appear to alter the expansive properties of the cement. Such release of antibiotics as did occur was thought to be related to the slow absorption of water by the slightly porous methyl methacrylate.
TI  - Anti-Pseudomonas heat-stable opsonins in acute lymphoblastic leukemia of childhood.
AB  - Heat-stable opsonic activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis was measured in sera of 33 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at selected times during treatment of their disease. Compared to adults, opsonization of P. aeruginosa was normal in children tested at the time of diagnosis and before chemotherapy. Immediately after achievement of remission, opsonic activity against Pseudomonas was significantly decreased (P smaller than 0.05) compared with pretreatment activity. Activity usually returned to normal and remained so during long-term remission maintenance therapy. In children studied just prior to death from unremitting leukemia, however, anti-Pseudomonas opsonic activity was significantly decreased when compared with that of a group of children before any leukemic treatment (p smaller than 0.005). Anti-S. EPIDERMIDIS OPSONIC ACTIVITY SHOWED NO CHANGES DURING THE PATIENT'S COURSE. Decreased serum opsonic activity may significantly contribute to the increased incidence of severe Pseudomonas infections in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
TI  - Growth inhibitory activity of deoxyribonucleic acid-containing factor(s) isolated from lepromatous lesions.
AB  - Deoxyribonucleic acid-containing factor(s) isolated from Mycobacterium leprae suspensions obtained from lepromas of nine patients showed growth inhibitory activity against Micrococcus and both orange-red-pigmented and coccoid mutants of mycobacteria. No growth inhibition was observed for parent mycobacterial species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - Bacteriocidal properties of platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates were contaminated with predetermined numbers of bacteria isolated from patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms were killed if the number introduced was less than 10(3). When 10(4) through 10(6) organisms were added, their growth was depressed for 24 hours and then slowly resumed. If more than 10(7) organisms were used, a slow and progressive growth occurred. After the concentrates were contaminated with Staphylocoecus aureus, slow progressive growth occurred regardless of the size of the inoculum. Cultures taken from sample phlebotomies performed on a few donors showed that the number and type of organisms released into the blood during the venepuncture are such that they could usually, but not always, be inactivated by the bacteriocidal property of the platelet packs. This bacteriocidal property will usually allow the platelet packs to be stored at room temperature for considerable amounts of time with relative safety. Bacterial growth will normally occur only when the number of organisms introduced during the venepuncture is quite large, and growth will usually occur during the first 24 hours.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
TI  - Comparative characteristics of human and porcine staphylococci and their differentiation in burn xenografting procedures.
AB  - Staphylococcus epidermidis from porcine skin differed from human cutaneous S. epidermidis in that the former strains were principally of the Baird-Parker biotype III group. The porcine-type strains were more proteolytic on casein and gelatin than were human strains, which were primarily of biotype II. Porcine strains were also elastolytic. Using supernatant fluids of broth cultures, the biotype II strains, but not the type III strains, were lipolytic in action on triolein. Both types of staphylococci were similar in enzymatic activities on Tween 80, egg yolk, and tributyrin. Elastase activity was not found in broth supernatant fluid of these bacteria. The porcine strains were retarded or inhibited from growing in media at pH 5.5. Action on casein agar followed by demonstration of elastase activity were used as markers to detect the porcine S. epidermidis strains in xenografts and on human burn wound grafting sites.
TI  - Evaluation of two commercially available media for detection of bacteremia.
AB  - Analysis of the results of 13,162 blood cultures during a 9-month interval has shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa statistically was recovered more frequently from Trypticase soy broth (TSB) than from Thioglycollate-135C and that contaminants, including Staphylococcus epidermidis and aerobic and anaerobic Corynebacterium species, were isolated with statistically greater frequency from Thioglycollate-135C than from TSB. No other statistically significant differences were found.
