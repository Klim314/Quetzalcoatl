TI  - The cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  - Coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the Western diet. Mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. We found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. Here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. Bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide. For selected strains pH activity profiles were determined. The culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. Species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: Rothia mucilaginosa HOT-681, Rothia aeria HOT-188, Actinomyces odontolyticus HOT-701, Streptococcus mitis HOT-677, Streptococcus sp. HOT-071, Neisseria mucosa HOT-682 and Capnocytophaga sputigena HOT-775, with Rothia species being active in all four assays. Cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. The approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kD (Rothia spp.), ~60 kD (A. odontolyticus) and ~150 kD (Streptococcus spp.). In conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. A cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.
TI  - Molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  - The initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. Characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. Using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. A total of 531 16S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes were identified. Microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. In all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were dominated by Streptococcus spp. belonging to the Streptococcus oralis/Streptococcus mitis group. Other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, Neisseria, Prevotella, Rothia, and Veillonella. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed that the proportion of Streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. FISH also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only Streptococcus spp. but also the rarer Prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. This study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject is unique in terms of diversity and composition. Repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Ecological effects of triclosan and triclosan monophosphate on defined mixed cultures of oral species grown in continuous culture.
AB  - The effects of triclosan and its phosphorylated derivative, triclosan monophosphate were studied using a continuous culture microcosm model. Two conditions were simulated, a caries-like state (pH 5.5 with artificial saliva plus glucose as growth medium) and a periodontal disease-like state (pH 7.5 with BHI plus yeast extract, haemin and cysteine as growth medium). Both cultures were maintained anaerobically at 37 degrees C at a growth rate of 0.1/h. Steady-state chemostats were pulsed with triclosan or triclosan monophosphate (initial concentrations between 20 and 40 mg/L) and changes in the ecological composition noted after 6 h. The caries-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, Lactobacillus and Veillonella sp. with low but detectable levels of Neisseria, Actinomyces and Fusobacterium sp. No significant ecological shifts occurred following pulses of either antimicrobial agent; all species were affected to approximately the same degree. The periodontal disease-like microcosm steady state was dominated by streptococci, Fusobacterium, Veillonella, Actinomyces, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp. with low numbers of Neisseria and Lactobacillus sp. Significant ecological shifts were apparent following pulses of triclosan. The streptococci became the dominant group followed by Fusobacterium sp. For triclosan monophosphate, the streptococci again became dominant although Lactobacillus and Actinomyces were now the main sub-dominant species and Gram-negative anaerobes including Fusobacterium sp. were markedly inhibited. It is concluded that in the periodontal disease state, both triclosan and triclosan monophosphate affected the Gram-negative anaerobes to a greater extent than the Gram-positive groups and that this effect was more marked for triclosan monophosphate.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  - Growth and acid production of glucose-grown Gram-positive and Gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. All Gram-positive rods, i.e. Actinomyces viscosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Gram-positive cocci, i.e. Streptococcus spp, Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. While Gram-negative cocci, i.e. Veillonella sp and Neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, Gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and Acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. Saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
TI  - The association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  - Sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. Culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. Over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. Analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured higher levels of Neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high Streptococcus sanguis levels and total Gram-positive cocci and fewer Gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of Streptococcus salivarius and Veillonella sp. Sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and Streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; Actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; Strep. mutans, Veillonella sp. and Lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and Strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. Sucrose intake was negatively related to concentrations of Neisseria sp. on the tongue and total Gram-positive bacilli in saliva. A definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. The high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.
TI  - A microbiological study of normal flora of macropod dental plaque.
AB  - The percentage bacterial composition of dental plaques from 12 macropods was determined. The major group of organisms was gram-positive filamentous and pleomorphic rods whose median representation was 92.2%. These were mainly Actinomyces viscosus (median value 62.5%) and Bacterionema matruchotii (median value 23.2%). Streptococci were poorly represented (median value 4.2%) as were anaerobic gram-negative organisms. Aerobic gram-negative bacteria were identified as neisseriae and Moraxella sp. The macropod plaque flora was compared with that of human beings and rodents and the differences discussed in relation to dietary differences and the early externalization of the marsupial young.
