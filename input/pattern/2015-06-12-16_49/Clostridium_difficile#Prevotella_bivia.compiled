TI  - Surveillance and trends of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates of anaerobes in Kuwait hospitals from 2002 to 2007.
AB  - The susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the Anaerobe Reference Laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in Kuwait from 2002 to 2007. MIC were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for Gram-positive anaerobes only), using E-test method. The commonest isolates were Bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by Peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), Bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and Prevotella bivia (12.1%). In addition, Prevotella oralis and other Bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. Resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. The beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the most active drugs. Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. Imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. However, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of Clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. It is noteworthy that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among B. fragilis. Periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of tinidazole and metronidazole against Clostridium difficile, Prevotella bivia and Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - Tinidazole, a 5-nitroimidazole similar to metronidazole, was studied against 40 Clostridium difficile, 10 Prevotella bivia and 11 Bacteroides fragilis clinical isolates. The geometric mean MICs of tinidazole and metronidazole were, respectively: C. difficile, 0.31 and 0.28 microg/mL; P. bivia, 2.33 and 1.52 microg/mL; B. fragilis, 0.5 and 0.71 microg/mL.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of PH-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of Clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - PH-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. The objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. The in vitro activity of PH-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and Etest methods. PH-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; MIC90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against Clostridium difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella bivia and Fusobacterium spp. respectively. In comparison, linezolid had MIC in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with MIC90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. PH-027 demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against Peptostreptococcus spp., B. fragilis and P. bivia. However, against C. difficile and Fusobacterium spp, PH-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity. Against all anaerobes, metronidazole, PH-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. From the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and PH-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - In vitro activity of an evernimicin derivative, SCH27899, against anaerobic bacteria and Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - The in vitro activity of SCH27899, a novel oligosaccharide antimicrobial agent, was compared with those of representatives of six classes of antimicrobial agents (piperacillin, clarithromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, sitafloxacin and metronidazole) against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria and Propionibacterium acnes. Against Peptostreptococcus: spp. and Clostridium difficile, SCH27899 was the most potent (MIC(90) < 0.125 mg/L) of the agents examined. Besides these Gram-positive anaerobes, SCH27899 showed a moderate level of activity against Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas: spp. (MIC(90)< or = 4 mg/L).
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro and in-vivo activity of AM-1155 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of AM-1155, a 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, was compared with those of temafloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and cefmetazole, a cephamycin, against a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Although AM-1155 demonstrated only modest activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group and Prevotella bivia (MIC90s > or =3.13 mg/mL), 76% of the B. fragilis strains tested were inhibited at AM-1155 concentrations of 0.78 mg/L. AM-1155 was highly active against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium spp., Clostridium perfringens and Mobiluncus spp. (MIC90s < or =0.39 mg/L). An in-vivo study using a mixed infection with AM-1155- and tosufloxacin-susceptible B. fragilis and Escherichia coli strains in rat granuloma pouch was performed. AM-1155 was effective against both organisms whereas tosufloxacin was effective only against E. coli. These results correlated well to the higher pouch levels of AM-1155 than those of tosufloxacin. Clostridium difficile overgrowth was found in the caecum of mice treated with ampicillin both 1 and 7 days after 5 days dosing, but not in AM-1155-treated mice. These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of AM-1155 against infections involving most anaerobic bacteria except for the B. fragilis group and P. bivia should be evaluated further.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared with imipenem, metronidazole, ampicillin, and ampicillin/sulbactam against anaerobes.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare the in vitro activity of meropenem (ICI 194660, CAS 96036-03-2) with imipenem, metronidazole, clindamycin, ampicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam against a variety of anaerobic bacteria using an agar dilution method. 423 clinical isolates were tested belonging to 70 species of 15 anaerobic genera. They included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62), Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 45), Prevotella bivia (n = 11), Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 12), Clostridium perfringens (n = 15) and several rarely isolated species and genera, e.g. Selenomonas sputigena and Clostridium symbiosum. Bacteroides species were inhibited by meropenem at < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml, Clostridium species, including C. difficile, at < or = 4.0 micrograms/ml and all the other anaerobes at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Meropenem and imipenem were the most active substances, but often equal to, or only slightly better than, metronidazole, clindamycin or ampicillin/sulbactam, dependent on species. Meropenem was especially active against Bacteroides gracilis (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Prevotella disiens (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml), Fusobacterium nucleatum (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml), Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 0.015 microgram/ml) and Veillonella parvula (MIC90 0.03 microgram/ml). The results obtained indicate that meropenem might be a useful adjunct to chemotherapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic and anaerobic infections.
