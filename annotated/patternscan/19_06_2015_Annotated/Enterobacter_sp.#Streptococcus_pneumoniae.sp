TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: mystic antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (icus) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. the mystic (meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. the in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. the isolates consisted of 19 species of gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including k. pneumoniae (n=49), e. coli (n=48), a. baumannii (n=47), enterobacter spp. (n=41), and p. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including staphylococcus aureus (n=63), enterococcus faecalis (n=22), streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative staphylococci (n=21). all  isolates were collected from icu patients. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest mic(90) for all species tested. gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). carbapenems were the most  active drugs overall and only p. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). we also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) among all enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by etest/esbl strip. esbl production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). among them, klebsiella pneumoniae  was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and e. coli (14.6%). the high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of esbl production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.

TI  == cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  == topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. the anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have  been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. the present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. the pathogens used were branhamella catarrhalis, enterobacter sp., haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. the bacteria  studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. these topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical  anesthetics when culturing specimens. this is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. this type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. a modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.

TI  == bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program (united states and canada, 1997).
AB  == the sentry program was established in january 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the united states (30 sites), canada (8 sites), south america (10 sites), and europe  (24 sites). during the first 6-month study period (january to june 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (bsi) were reported by north american sentry participants (4,119 from the united states and 939 from canada). in both the united states and canada, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were the most common bsi isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10  most frequently reported species in both the united states and canada. although the rank orders of pathogens in the united states and canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several  pathogens. overall, u.s. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from canada. the differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant s. aureus  isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for u.s. and canadian  isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for u.s. and canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (meca, vana, and vanb) in the canadian microbial population. among u.s. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to  penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost  every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.

TI  == [clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, serratia liquefaciens, and aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of staphylococcus sp., one each of streptococcus sp. and streptococcus pneumoniae. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas sp. were not detected. resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. as a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. this  study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. the combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.

TI  == the management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  == the standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. for those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. over a  six-year-period, from january 1985 to december 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. the initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. the surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. there were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. the blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic streptococcus sp. in two, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. from the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and enterobacter sp. in two. both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature,  and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in  all patients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. we have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: streptococcus pneumoniae (3), staphylococcus aureus (2), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and enterobacter sp (1). seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees c), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/l [greater than 18,000 cells/microl]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (enterobacter [3], klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and staphylococcus [2]). two other donors with hepatitis b surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of pseudomonas septicemia. late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group  of recipients. this practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.

TI  == evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [in vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  == imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. to test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several medical centers in brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding mic were  carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of s. paulo, rio de janeiro and salvador. our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this  country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding mic correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (e. coli), 93% (pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (staphylococcus aureus), 100% (klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (klebsiella sp), 97% (proteus mirabiles), 94% (enterobacter sp), 100% (streptococcus faecalis) with good mic correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species bacteroides sp (mic up to 4 micrograms/ml). "in vitro"  efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably bacteroides sp is  emphasized.

TI  == efficacy and safety of cefpirome (hr810).
AB  == sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and  joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were escherichia coli (6), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and haemophilus influenzae (1). one patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. in wound cultures, three strains of staphylococcus aureus and one each of ps. aeruginosa and str. faecalis persisted. one enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. of isolated strains, only str. faecalis and methicillin resistant staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. adverse  effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). tolerance was good. cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility of clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in japan between  may, 1985 through march, 1986. these tests were organized by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. this paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of  clinical isolates including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, morganella  morganii, serratia marcescens, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (oflx) and conventional antibacterial drugs. the results obtained were  summarized as follows. 1. oflx showed strong antibacterial activity against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, e. aerogenes, e. cloacae, c. freundii, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp. and c. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to oflx. moreover, oflx has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. when studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, oflx occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. almost species from the  urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.

AB  == nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (nho) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot  puncture (3). infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). in 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: staphylococcus aureus (9), staphylococcus epidermidis (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), escherichia coli (2), enterobacter sp. (2), streptococcus faecalis, serratia sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, achromobacter xylosoxidans, aeromonas hydrophila and pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). nho recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. the indolent nature of nho complicates diagnosis, especially  in patients with recent compound fractures. only prompt bone culture can confirm  the presence of nho and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: e. coli (n = 50), enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and  streptococci (n = 51). the results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.

TI  == cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  == sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. in a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. the data were unsuitable for  determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. all strains of streptococcus equi, streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of actinobacillus  suis were highly susceptible to the drug (mic less than 4 micrograms/ml). escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (mic 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of corynebacterium (rhodococcus) equi, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be  highly resistant to cefadroxil (mic greater than 128 micrograms/ml).

AB  == a total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. the drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections;  ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. with respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella sp, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp, and proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (staphyloccocus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). of 205  patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. none of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.

TI  == quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  == quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were  counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. these plates were incubated at 37 degrees c overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. after this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. these plates were incubated again at 37 degrees c overnight. the minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. the lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. when compared for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia  marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.

TI  == antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates. both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean mics of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. however, the mbc for penicillin-resistant s. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. all strains of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus viridans, and streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., proteus mirabilis, and hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. eighty per cent of strains of h. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. most strains of enterobacter sp., indole-positive proteus, pseudomonas sp., and serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.

TI  == bacteriological evaluation of fosfomycin in clinical studies.
AB  == since fosfomycin has behaved in vitro as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, an attempt  has been made to evaluate this behaviour in controlled clinical study carried out at different spanish hospitals. a total of 959 patients were treated for some of  the following infectious clinical processes: gonococcal urethritis, typhoid fever, enterocolitis, acute and chronic urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis,  chronic otorrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis, peritonitis, surgical and suppurative infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngoamygdalitis, burns, endometritis, ocular infection, whooping cough and nasal carriers of s. aureus. the results obtained as a function of the microorganism isolated in these clinical processes  in percentage of clinical and bacteriological success have been 96% of the s. aureus infections, 95% of the streptococcus sp. including s. pneumoniae, 90% of the n. gonorrhoeae infections, 94% of the e. coli infections including enteropathogenic e. coli, 90% of the s. marcescens infections, 76% of the proteus sp. infections, 72% of the klebsiella-enterobacter infections, 66% of p. aeruginosa infections and 78% of the s. typhi infections.

TI  == microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, bl-s 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  == bl-s 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature  of the assay medium. when assayed in nutrient agar, bl-s 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of diplococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter, and indole-positive proteus sp. however, when assayed in mueller-hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. the in vivo activity of bl-s 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. when bl-s 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. bl-s 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. recovery of bl-s 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

TI  == enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (ph 6.0 to 8.2). this effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis. the urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting e. coli and k. pneumoniae even when diluted  up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same ph as the urine. undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable  of inhibiting these organisms. the range of ph (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
