TI  == bacteria isolated from dugongs (dugong dugon) submitted for postmortem examination in queensland, australia, 2000-2011.
AB  == microbial infection may contribute to disease in a significant proportion of marine mammal mortalities, but little is known about infectious bacterial species and their prevalence in dugongs (dugong dugon). this study represents a survey of the species of bacteria and fungi isolated from dugongs submitted to the university of queensland's school of veterinary science for postmortem examination. thirty-six dugongs were included in the survey, with 23 species of bacteria and four species of fungus cultured from lesions that were suspected of  contributing to local infection, systemic infection, or both. the most abundant bacteria included aeromonas spp., clostridium spp., vibrio spp., enterococcus faecalis, and pseudomonas spp. in six cases, the microorganism(s) cultured were considered to have been associated with disease. mixed infections containing aeromonas spp. and vibrio spp.; morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida, and serratia marcescens; and actinomyces spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. were associated with pneumonia or pleuritis, and enterococcus faecalis was associated  with a multisystemic infection in a neonate. clostridium spp. was cultured from two animals with peritonitis and likely septicemia. the significance of many of the other isolates is uncertain because the samples were taken after death, and some of the species isolated may represent postmortem overgrowth. it is also difficult to fulfil koch's postulates through experimental infection in marine mammals. regardless, this information will assist clinicians working with dugongs to make treatment decisions and the baseline data on the prevalence of bacterial  and fungal species is of value for monitoring coastal water habitat health and risks of zoonotic disease transmission.

TI  == evaluation of subgingival bacteria in the dog and susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the subgingival aerobic and  anaerobic flora of 13 dogs with periodontal disease and the susceptibility of these bacteria to antibiotics currently approved in italy for treatment of canine infections. of the anaerobic bacteria, bacteroides fragilis was most frequently isolated, followed by peptostreptococcus + porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. of the aerobic bacteria, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus was most frequently isolated, often associated with escherichia coli or pasteurella multocida. resistance of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria to various antibiotics was generally high. anaerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin  + clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and erythromycin; aerobic bacteria appeared to be susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, erythromycin, gentamycin, and sulfa-trimethoprim. bacteroides fragilis was resistant to all of the antibiotics  tested. the emerging worldwide problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics resulting from overuse and misuse of antibiotics is discussed.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot  for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains  requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella  canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft-tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of abt-773, a new ketolide, against 268 aerobic and 148 anaerobic recent isolates from clinical bites using an agar dilution method and inocula of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu for anaerobes. the following are the mic ranges and mics at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)s) of abt-773 for various isolates, respectively: pasteurella multocida and pasteurella septica, 0.125 to 2 and 1 microg/ml; other  pasteurella species, 0.125 to 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.015 to 0.06 and 0.015 microg/ml; staphylococcus aureus, 0.03 to 0.06 and 0.06 microg/ml; coagulase-negative staphylococci, 0.015 to >32 and 32 microg/ml; streptococci, 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.03 microg/ml; eikenella corrodens, 0.25 to 1 and 1 microg/ml; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.03 to 0.25 and 0.06 microg/ml. for anaerobes the mic  ranges and mic(90)s of abt-773 were as follows, respectively: prevotella heparinolytica, 0. 06 to 0.125 and 0.125 microg/ml; prevotella spp., 0.015 to 0.125 and 0.06 microg/ml; porphyromonas spp., 0.015 to 0.03 and 0.015 microg/ml;  fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5 to 8 and 8 microg/ml; other fusobacterium spp., 0.015 to 8 and 0.5 microg/ml; bacteroides tectum, 0.015 to 0.5 and 0.06 microg/ml; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.015 to 0.25 and 0.03 microg/ml. abt-773 was more active than all macrolides tested against s. aureus, e. corrodens, and anaerobes, but all compounds were poorly active against f. nucleatum. the activity of abt-773 was within 1 dilution of that of azithromycin against pasteurella spp., and abt-773 was four- to eightfold more active than clarithromycin against pasteurella spp. abt-773 may offer a therapeutic alternative for bite wound infections.

TI  == the obligate and facultatively anaerobic bacterial flora of the normal feline gingival margin.
AB  == samples from the gingival margins of 14 cats considered normal on clinical examination were cultured for facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. all mouths were free from any gingival marginal inflammation and tartar build-up; all cats were between 6 and 12 months of age. a mixed growth was obtained from all samples. the mean number of bacterial species per sample was 10.7 with a range of 7-16 isolates. of the 150 isolates processed, 109 (72.66%) were obligate anaerobes. of the facultatively anaerobic species, actinomyces (including a. viscosus, a. hordeovulneris and a. denticolens) comprised 12%, pasteurella multocida 9.33% of isolates and propionibacterium species 6% of all isolates. gram-negative bacilli belonging to the genera bacteroides and fusobacterium were  isolated from 12 of the 14 samples, and comprised 77% of the obligate anaerobes isolated. clostridium villosum comprised 10.1% of obligately anaerobic isolates,  wolinella species made up 6.42%, while 4.58% were peptostreptococcus anaerobius.  the most commonly isolated obligately anaerobic species was c. villosum and the most commonly isolated facultatively anaerobic species was p. multocida. these findings show a bacterial flora of the normal feline mouth which is very similar  in composition to that of cat fight abscesses and feline pyothorax.

TI  == comparative activities of cefuroxime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and ofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from bite wounds.
AB  == we studied the comparative in vitro activities of 10 oral antimicrobial agents against 147 aerobic and 61 anaerobic bacteria making up species in 13 genera (staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, eikenella corrodens, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus-actinobacillus spp., m-5, ef-4, moraxella spp., flavobacterium iib, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp.) that were isolated from bite wounds. cefuroxime was generally greater than fourfold more active than cephalexin and cefadroxil against all aerobic isolates, including pasteurella multocida. the fluoroquinolones were highly active against most aerobic isolates but were less active against anaerobic isolates. ciprofloxacin was generally more active than either enoxacin or ofloxacin. discrepancies of greater than 30% in the interpretation of susceptibilities between break points suggested by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards and those related to oral dose peak levels (one-half to one-quarter of maximum achievable concentrations) were noted  in 14% (18 of 130) of the instances.

TI  == bacteriology of periodontal disease in the cat.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 32 cats showing different stages of periodontal disease. correlations were sought between gingival index scores and the prevalence of various microbial groups, and between microbial populations found in sites designated as most-affected and least-affected within individual cats. the tendency with higher gingival index scores, and with the most-affected  sites, was toward a microbial population composed to a greater extent of anaerobic gram-negative rods. the most common organism was an anaerobic gram-negative rod in the black-pigmented bacteroides group that was biochemically similar to b. gingivalis but had catalase activity. the black-pigmented bacteroides group and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were found in increasing numbers with increasingly severe periodontal disease. pasteurella multocida was isolated from most samples and appeared to decrease in numbers with increasing periodontal disease.

TI  == role of anaerobic bacteria in bite-wound infections.
AB  == the etiologic agents usually involved in wound infections due to human or animal  bites are the aerobic skin flora of the victim, e.g., staphylococcus aureus, and/or the aerobic oral flora of the biter, e.g., pasteurella multocida. while anaerobic bacteria are predominant in the normal oral flora of humans and animals, their importance in the pathogenesis of bite-wound infections has not been stressed. most investigators in this field have either not cultured these wounds for anaerobic bacteria or not utilized optimal culture techniques. in a series of studies on human and animal bite wounds, methods that are optimal for recovery of anaerobic bacteria were used. anaerobes were found in significant quantities in 39% of animal bite wounds, 50% of human bite wounds, and 56% of clenched-fist injuries. several species of anaerobes usually were present in the  wounds and always were present in mixed culture with aerobic oral flora. the anaerobes most commonly isolated included bacteroides asaccharolyticus, bacteroides bivius, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, bacteroides ruminicola, bacteroides pneumosintes, bacteroides ureolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium russii, peptococcus species,  peptostreptococcus species, and veillonella species. initial, empiric antimicrobial therapy for bite wounds should be directed against potential anaerobic as well as aerobic pathogens.

TI  == microorganisms associated with abscesses of sheep and goats in the south of iran.
AB  == a total of 86 abscesses (45 and 41) abscesses of sheep and goats, respectively) were examined for their causal agents; 44 of these abscesses were located subcutaneously, and the remaining 42 were in lungs, livers, intestines, and udders. a total of 23 different types of microorganisms were isolated from 78 abscesses; bacteria were not detected in the remaining eight abscesses. microorganisms isolated were: species of the genera corynebacterium, staphylococcus, and streptococcus and pasteurella, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. peptostreptococcus anaerobius and eubacterium tortuosum were  isolated in pure culture from one abscess each in goats. two to four different microorganisms were associated with 25 of the 86 abscesses. it was determined that 11 isolates of corynebacterium pyogenes, 2 isolates of pasteurella haemolytica, 1 of p multocida, and 1 of c pseudotuberculosis were lethal to mice. two of the c pyogenes isolates from subcutaneous spreading abscesses of goats were pathogenic for rabbits; these two isolates produced similar suppurative inflammation in goats experimentally, but did not cause death. as determined by experimental inoculation, goats were more susceptible than sheep to the two isolates. in nature, subcutaneous abscesses of goats associated with c pyogenes were of a more diffusive type which resulted in generalization of the infection and death of the animals. postmortem examination of ten goats dying of field infection showed the presence of larvae of the warble-fly przhevalskiana silenus  at the site of infection.
