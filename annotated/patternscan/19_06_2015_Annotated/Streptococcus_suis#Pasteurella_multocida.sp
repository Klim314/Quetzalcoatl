TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine.
AB  == susceptibility results for pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolated  from swine clinical samples were obtained from january 1998 to october 2010 from  the animal health laboratory at the university of guelph, guelph, ontario, and used to describe variation in antimicrobial resistance (amr) to 4 drugs of importance in the ontario swine industry: ampicillin, tetracycline, tiamulin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. four temporal data-analysis options were used: visualization of trends in 12-month rolling averages, logistic-regression modeling, temporal-scan statistics, and a scan with the "what's strange about recent events?" (wsare) algorithm. the amr trends varied among the antimicrobial  drugs for a single pathogen and between pathogens for a single antimicrobial, suggesting that pathogen-specific amr surveillance may be preferable to indicator data. the 4 methods provided complementary and, at times, redundant results. the  most appropriate combination of analysis methods for surveillance using these data included temporal-scan statistics with a visualization method (rolling-average or predicted-probability plots following logistic-regression models). the wsare algorithm provided interesting results for quality control and has the potential to detect new resistance patterns; however, missing data created problems for displaying the results in a way that would be meaningful to  all surveillance stakeholders.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility monitoring of respiratory tract pathogens isolated from diseased cattle and pigs across europe: the vetpath study.
AB  == vetpath is an ongoing pan-european antibiotic susceptibility monitoring programme collecting pathogens from diseased antimicrobial non-treated cattle, pigs and poultry. in the current study, 1001 isolates from cattle and pig respiratory tract infections were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibilities. non-replicate lung samples or nasopharyngeal/nasal swabs were collected from animals with acute clinical signs in 11 countries during 2002-2006. pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica from cattle and p. multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and streptococcus suis from pigs were isolated by standard methods. s. suis was also isolated from meningitis cases. mics of 16 antibiotics  were assessed centrally by broth microdilution following clsi recommendations. results were interpreted using clsi breakpoints where available. p. multocida (231) and m. haemolytica (138) isolates were all susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. resistance to florfenicol and spectinomycin was 0.4% and 3.5% in p. multocida, respectively, and absent in m. haemolytica isolates. tetracycline resistance was 5.7% and 14.6% for p. multocida and m. haemolytica. in pigs, 230 p. multocida, 220 a. pleuropneumoniae and 182 s. suis isolates were recovered. resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tiamulin and tilmicosin was absent or <1%. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole resistance was 3-6% and tetracycline resistance varied from 14.7% in a. pleuropneumoniae to 81.8% in s. suis. in conclusion, low  resistance to antibiotics with defined clinical breakpoints, except for tetracycline, was observed among the major respiratory tract pathogens recovered  from cattle and pigs. since for approximately half of the antibiotics in this panel no clsi-defined breakpoints were available, setting of the missing veterinary breakpoints is important.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data on escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida,  and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario swine (january 1998 to october 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in ontario, canada. in relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. these changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.

TI  == multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 porcine circovirus type-2 associated disease outbreak.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine 1998-2010. temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the e. coli and p. multocida data. although not present in the e. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within p. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of porcine circovirus associated disease (pcvad) before it was confirmed. prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the pcvad outbreak in the fall of 2004.

TI  == haemophilus parasuis serovars isolated from pathological samples in northern italy.
AB  == from january 2007 to december 2011, a total of 106 haemophilus parasuis strains isolated from pigs were serotyped by agar gel diffusion test (dg). serovar 4 was  the most prevalent (24.5%), followed by serovar 13 (19.8%) and serovar 5 (11.3%). twenty-nine strains were non-typeable (27.3%). the strains were divided into two  groups, depending on whether they were isolated from specific pathological lesions of systemic disease such as polyserositis, arthritis or meningitis (73 cases of 106) or from the lower respiratory tract of pigs suffering from bronchopneumonia (33 cases of 106). serovars 4 and 13 had a higher prevalence in  systemic infection (polyserositis) than in respiratory disease only. pasteurella  multocida (14/106), streptococcus suis (7/106), actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (4/106), bordetella bronchiseptica (3/106) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (3/106) were isolated in association with h. parasuis.

TI  == bacterial pathogens associated with lung lesions in slaughter pigs from 125 herds.
AB  == relationships between macroscopic lesions and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (mhp), pasteurella multocida (pm), actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and streptococcus suis (ssuis) of the lungs of 3731 slaughter pigs from 125 herds were assessed in france. pneumonia and pleuritis were the most frequent lesions (69.3% and 15% of the lungs, respectively). mhp, pm, app, ssuis and hps were detected in 69.3%, 36.9%, 20.7%, 6.4% and 0.99% of the lungs, respectively. mhp and pm were associated with pneumonia at both the pig and herd levels. pleuritis  was not associated with any pathogen at the pig level, but was associated with a  high percentage of pigs pcr-positive for app at the herd level. measures focused  on control of mhp, pm and app should significantly reduce the occurrence of both  pneumonia and pleuritis.

TI  == microbial ecology of swine farms and prrs vaccine vaccination strategies.
AB  == the present study investigated the microbial ecology and vaccination strategies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (prrs) in field condition.  four representative farms with a history of prrs were included in this study. over the almost 3-year period, the average detection rate was 68.9%, making prrsv the first most frequently detected virus, followed by porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) (64.2%), pseudorabies virus (prv) (11.03%) and classical swine fever virus (csfv) (4.41%). streptococcus suis (77.92%), haemophilus parasuis (51.25%) and escherichia coli (52.39%), pasteurella multocida (26.77%) were isolated most frequently in association with prrsv. under the present microbial ecology, production performances of sows their offspring after mass vaccination with a prrs attenuated vaccine were evaluated. in addition, large scale prrs vaccines usage and efficacy were further performed. the results indicated that mass vaccination following our immunization program can improve health status and production performances of both sows (2ml/i.m. booster after 4 weeks, and then immunized quarterly) and their offsprings (1ml/i.m. on 14-18 days of age).

TI  == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB  == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both  swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium  pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9%  of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica  were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI  == influence of a pig respiratory disease on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of amoxicillin after oral ad libitum administration in medicated feed.
AB  == the pharmacokinetic properties of amoxicillin in healthy and respiratory-diseased pigs were studied, after ad libitum administration of medicated feed. in addition, amoxicillin dose linearity and drug penetration into respiratory tract  tissues were evaluated in diseased animals. the respiratory disease involves porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and bacterial agents such as  pasteurella multocida, bordetella bronchiseptica and streptococcus suis. typical  clinical signs and gross lesions of respiratory disease were observed. the plasma pharmacokinetic analysis was performed by means of a noncompartmental approach. after single intravenous bolus administration of amoxicillin to healthy pigs, the steady-state volume of distribution was 0.61 l/kg, the total plasma clearance was 0.83 l/h/kg and the mean residence time was 0.81 h. after oral bolus administration, the mean absorption time was 1.6 h and the peak plasma concentration (3.09 mug/ml) reached at 1.1 h postadministration. the oral bioavailability was 34%. for oral ad libitum administration, plasma concentration-time profiles were related to the feeding behaviour. plasma concentrations at steady-state were established between 12 and 120 h. the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated (c(maxss) , c(minss) , c(avss) and auc(24ss) ) showed significantly lower values in healthy pigs compared to diseased animals. this was in accordance with the significantly higher amoxicillin bioavailability (44.7% vs. 14.1%) and longer absorption period observed in diseased pigs. amoxicillin dose linearity in diseased animals was established in a dose range of 4-18 mg/kg. on the other hand, tissue distribution ratio in diseased animals was 0.65 for bronchial mucosa, 0.48 for lung tissue and 0.38 for lymph nodes. our results suggest that the pharmacokinetic properties and disposition of amoxicillin can be influenced by the disease state or by related factors such as changes in the gastrointestinal transit.

TI  == plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  == florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in  pigs caused by strains of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to  be marginal for diseases caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus. the reported minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/ml. an experiment was conducted during september and october 2009. one hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (landrace-yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. they  were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by hplc. considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. however, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with mic breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/ml. decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with mic >0.25 mug/ml, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of streptococcus  suis or e. coli to this drug.

TI  == epidemiological characteristics of pulmonary pneumocystosis and concurrent infections in pigs in jeju island, korea.
AB  == epidemiological characteristics of swine pulmonary pneumocystis (p.) carinii and  concurrent infections were surveyed on jeju island, korea, within a designated period in 172 pigs submitted from 54 farms to the department of veterinary medicine, jeju national university. the submitted cases were evaluated by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, pcr/rt-pcr, and bacteriology. p. carinii infection was confirmed in 39 (22.7%) of the 172 pigs. histopathologically, the lungs had moderate to severe lymphohistioctyic interstitial pneumonia with variable numbers of fungal organisms within lesions. furthermore, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2) co-infection was a common phenomenon (12.8%, 20.5%, and 48.7% were positive for prrs, pcv-2, or both, respectively, as determined by pcr/rt-pcr). infection was much more concentrated during winter (december to march) and 53.8%  of the infected pigs were 7- to 8-weeks old. in addition, three pigs showed co-infection with bacteria such as pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis.  the results of the present study suggest that the secondary p. carinii infection  is common following primary viral infection in swine in korea. they further suggest that co-infection of p. carinii might be enhanced by the virulence of primary pathogens or might have synergistic effects in the pigs with chronic wasting diseases.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from respiratory tract of pigs in  poland between 2004 and 2008.
AB  == antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated from nasal swabs and lungs of pigs, to 16 commonly used antibiotics, was determined by disc diffusion test. beta-lactams showed the best activity against streptococcus suis (s. suis) (> 99% of susceptible strains). the lowest sensitivity of s. suis was evidenced to: tylosin, tetracycline and neomycin (50%, 40% and 25%, respectively). isolates of  escherichia coli (e. coli) demonstrated the highest susceptibility to cephalosporin (85% strains), gentamicin and norfloxacin (over 74%). the lowest susceptibility of e. coli was demonstrated to tiamulin and penicillin (11.3% and  1.9%, respectively). over 80% of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (app) strains were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. the highest resistance of app, but demonstrated by below 20% of tested isolates only, was evidenced to neomycin and  lxs. isolates of pasteurella multocida (pm), haemophilus parasuis (hps) and arcanobacterium pyogenes (a. pyogenes) were highly susceptible to the most antibiotics included in the analysis. the comparison of the in vitro susceptibility of pathogens to the chemotherapeutics used on polish farms for the therapy of bacterial infection of pigs within the last five years and the last 10 years, showed an increasing percent of e. coli and s. suis strains resistant to commonly used antibiotics. it is also shown that pm, hps, app and a. pyogenes isolates were continuously susceptible to the most chemotherapeutics applied.

TI  == bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions.
AB  == antimicrobial proteins in neutrophil granules exert their bactericidal activity both within the neutrophil phagolysosome and as components of neutrophil extracellular traps. this study evaluated the bactericidal activity of porcine neutrophil secretions against four bacterial pathogens of swine. porcine neutrophils were treated with or without phorbol myristate acetate (pma), then the resulting supernatants were incubated with escherichia coli k-12, streptococcus suis, actinobacillus suis, or pasteurella multocida, and the surviving colony forming units were enumerated. supernatants of pma-activated neutrophils killed an average of 95% of e. coli k-12 cells, relative to supernatants from untreated neutrophils. inhibition of elastase activity using chloromethylketone (cmk) prior to pma stimulation significantly reduced the bactericidal activity of the neutrophil supernatants; 57% of the pma-induced bactericidal activity against e. coli k-12 was estimated to be elastase-dependent. the same neutrophil supernatants had lower bactericidal activity against s. suis, a. suis, and p. multocida, with 30%, 36% and 13% reduction in bacterial numbers, respectively. the cathelicidin porcine myeloid antimicrobial peptide (pmap)-36 and lactotransferrin were among the proteins identified in the supernatants of pma-stimulated neutrophils by mass spectrometry. these findings imply that elastase-activated proteins, such as cathelicidins, are partially responsible for the bactericidal effect of porcine neutrophil secretions, but non-elastase-dependent proteins such as lactoferrin may also contribute. further, the secretions of activated neutrophils were effective in killing the avirulent e. coli k-12 but were less effective against the other bacteria tested, suggesting that these pathogens may have evolved mechanisms to resist neutrophil-mediated killing.

TI  == longitudinal study of respiratory infection patterns of breeding sows in five farrow-to-finish herds.
AB  == a longitudinal study was carried out in five french farrow-to-finish herds differently affected by respiratory diseases to describe the carrying and infection patterns of batches of sows to various respiratory pathogens during gestation and lactation. an entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and streptococcus suis were detected  from swab samples using pcr assays. blood samples were tested for antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae, a. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, porcine circovirus type-2 (pcv-2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) by elisa tests. antibodies against h(1)n(1), h(1)n(2) and h(3)n(2) swine  influenza viruses (siv) of european lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. the results indicated that s. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of pcr-positive sows). a. pleuropneumoniae, p. multocida, and h. parasuis  were detected by pcr in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. antibodies against m. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. although pcv-2 and siv infections were highly prevalent, the prrsv infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. the sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  == in a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in grenada, west indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth,  nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. a total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to  species level and 46 to genus level. a commercial bacterial identification system (api/biomerieux), was used for this purpose. the most common species was escherichia coli (n=60), followed by staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), s. hominis (16), s. haemolyticus (12), streptococcus canis (9), proteus mirabilis (8), pasteurella multocida (7), streptococcus mitis (7), staphylococcus xylosus (7), s. capitis (6), s. chromogenes (4), s. sciuri (3), s. auricularis (2), s. lentus (2), s. hyicus (2), streptococcus suis (2) and pseudomonas argentinensis (2). sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. a molecular method  using 16s rrna sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. e. coli and s. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. s. felis/simulans was the most  common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. p. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. staphylococcus aureus, or s. intemedius/s. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested  against, including tetracycline.

TI  == the occurrence of bordetella bronchiseptica in pigs with clinical respiratory disease.
AB  == between january 2003 and september 2008, 652 bordetella bronchiseptica isolates were cultured from 3506 lung samples collected from pigs with respiratory disease. over the 6-year period, the average isolation rate was 18.6%, making b.  bronchiseptica the fourth most frequently isolated pathogenic bacterium from those lung samples. the isolation rates in different years and provinces ranged from 15.2% to 25.7% and 17.3% to 20.7%, respectively. there were significant influences of sampling month and pig age on bacterial isolation (p<0.05). streptococcus suis (29.9%), haemophilus parasuis (26.7%) and escherichia coli (21.6%) were isolated most frequently in association with b. bronchiseptica. all  12 toxigenic pasteurella multocida strains co-isolated with b. bronchiseptica from 63 cases of atrophic rhinitis were classified into serogroup d. the results  suggest that b. bronchiseptica infection is highly prevalent in pig farms in china, and is often accompanied by co-infection with other bacteria.

TI  == occurrence of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in suckling and nursery pigs in a region of high pig density.
AB  == the occurrence of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections in young pigs was surveyed  in a retrospective study of 1122 datasets obtained from routine diagnostics where either suckling or nursery pigs were examined for m hyopneumoniae in lung tissue. findings were correlated with the presence of lung lesions, detection of other respiratory pathogens, vaccination history and parameters describing the herd of  origin. the prevalence of m hyopneumoniae in lung tissue from 201 suckling pigs was 2.0 per cent and, therefore, significantly lower than in lung tissue from 921 nursery pigs, which was 9.3 per cent. previous use of antimicrobials and the vital status of the pigs when delivered for postmortem examination did not influence the detection of m hyopneumoniae infection. the presence of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv)-eu genotype, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis, mycoplasma hyorhinis or streptococcus suis was correlated with a higher probability of also finding m hyopneumoniae. the history of vaccination, the time of the first or second application, and the type of vaccine (one- versus two-shot) did not influence the detection of m hyopneumoniae. a correlation between the type of herd and the presence of m hyopneumoniae was statistically insignificant and no effect of farrowing rhythm could be confirmed.

TI  == isolation, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence genes of pasteurella multocida strains from swine in china.
AB  == a total of 233 isolates of pasteurella multocida were obtained from 2,912 cases of clinical respiratory disease in pigs in china, giving an isolation rate of 8.0%. serogroup a p. multocida isolates were isolated from 92 cases (39.5%), and  serogroup d isolates were isolated from 128 cases (54.9%); 12 isolates (5.2%) were untypeable. p. multocida was the fourth most frequent pathogenic bacterium recovered from the respiratory tract, after streptococcus suis, haemophilus parasuis, and escherichia coli. all isolates were characterized for their susceptibilities to 20 antibiotics and the presence of 19 genes for virulence factors (vfs). the frequency of antimicrobial resistance among p. multocida isolates from swine in china was higher than that reported among p. multocida isolates from swine in from other countries, and 93.1% of the isolates showed multiple-drug resistance. there was a progressive increase in the rate of multiresistance to more than seven antibiotics, from 16.2% in 2003 to 62.8% in 2007. the resistance profiles suggested that cephalosporins, florfenicol, and fluoroquinolones were the drugs most likely to be active against p. multocida. use of pcr showed that colonization factors (ptfa, fima, and hsf-2), iron acquisition factors, sialidases (nanh), and outer membrane proteins occurred in most porcine strains. the vfs pfha, tadd, toxa, and pmhas were each present in <50% of strains. the various vfs exhibited distinctive associations with serogroups: concentrated in serogroup a, concentrated in serogroup d, or occurring jointly in serogroups a and d. these findings provide novel insights into the epidemiological characteristics of porcine p. multocida isolates and suggest that the potential threat of such multiresistant bacteria in food-producing animals should not be neglected.

AB  == tonsillar and nasal swabs were collected from weanling pigs in 50 representative  ontario swine herds and tested for the presence of 5 important bacterial upper respiratory tract pathogens. all but 1 herd (2%) tested positive for streptococcus suis by polymerase chain reaction (pcr); 48% of herds were s. suis  serovar 2, 1/2 positive. in all but 2 herds there was evidence of haemophilus parasuis infection. in contrast, toxigenic strains of pasteurella multocida were  detected by a p. multocida--enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (pmt-elisa) in only one herd. seventy-eight percent of the herds were diagnosed positive for actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae by apxiv pcr. sera from finishing pigs on the same farms were also collected and tested by elisa for the presence of a. pleuropneumoniae antibodies. seventy percent of the herds tested had evidence of  antibodies to a. pleuropneumoniae including serovars 1-9-11 (2%), 2 (4%), 3-6-8-15 (15%), 5 (6%), 4-7 (26%), and 12 (17%). this likely represents a shift from previous years when infection with a. pleuropneumoniae serovars 1, 5, and 7  predominated. at least 16% and possibly as many as 94% of the herds tested were actinobacillus suis positive; only 3 of the 50 herds were both a. pleuropneumoniae and a. suis negative as judged by the absence of a positive pcr  test for apxii. taken together, these data suggest that over the past 10 years, there has been a shift in the presence of pathogenic bacteria carried by healthy  ontario swine with the virtual elimination of toxigenic strains of p. multocida and a move to less virulent a. pleuropneumoniae serovars. as well, there appears  to be an increase in prevalence of s. suis serovar 2, 1/2, but this may be a reflection of the use of a more sensitive detection method.

TI  == evaluation of pyelonephritis in culled indoor and outdoor high parity sows.
AB  == the present trial was conducted in hungary in neighboring large indoor and outdoor pig production units, belonging to the same breeding company. rejected kidneys from 201 (out of 241; 83.4%) outdoor, and 191 (out of 512, 37.3%) indoor  high parity sows, with previous history of recidiving postparturient fever and excessive postparturient vulvovaginal discharge were gross pathologically bacteriologically, and histologically evaluated. all rejected kidneys revealed chronic pyelonephritis. in outdoor sows escherichia (e.) coli and actinobaculum (a.) suis were cultured from all kidneys. besides e. coli and a. suis, clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus faecalis), staphylococci (staphylococcus (s.) albus,  s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. were  concurrently found in 131 (64.7%) kidneys; pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida, proteus spp. were concurrently found beside e. coli and a. suis in 71 (35.3%) kidneys. in indoor sows e. coli and a. suis were cultured from all kidneys as well. pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter, pasteurella multocida,  proteus spp. were found beside e. coli and a. suis in 21 (11%) kidneys. however only 6 sows (3.1%) revealed the concurrent presence of clostridium spp., arcanobacterium pyogenes, gram-positive streptococci (enterococci, streptococcus  faecalis), staphylococci (s. albus, s. epidermis, s. aureus), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and klebsiella spp. implications: in eastern european climate, more high parity outdoor sows with recidiving postparturient fever and vulvovaginal discharge have pyelonephritis and higher diversity of pathogenic bacteria in the renal pelvis compared with indoor sows.

TI  == transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to specific pathogen free pigs at slaughter.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the transmission of pathogenic respiratory bacteria to thirteen 5-month-old specific pathogen free (spf) pigs, during the slaughtering process in a commercial slaughterhouse. before transportation, the spf pigs and the lorry were checked to confirm the absence of pathogenic respiratory bacteria. nine spf pigs (group 1) were in contact in a conventional slaughterhouse with finishing pigs, during 4h before slaughtering. four spf pigs (group 2) were slaughtered immediately at arrival in the slaughterhouse. five bacterial pathogens (mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and  streptococcus suis) were detected by pcr, after slaughtering, from nasal cavities, tonsils and trachea in the two groups of pigs. lung samples were pcr negative. three and four bacterial species were isolated from the pigs of group 2 and group 1, respectively. cultures were negative from the lungs. all the bacterial species present in the spf pigs were detected by pcr. p. multocida was  isolated, from three samples of scalding water before the onset of slaughtering.  our results suggest that the spf pigs became contaminated mainly by the slaughterhouse environment and the scalding water. histological examinations revealed that during scalding, contaminated water could reach the trachea and the lungs of pigs. checks conducted at slaughter for respiratory disorders have to be carried on, but nasal cavities and tonsils are not appropriate for bacteriological investigations. moreover, bacteriological results obtained from the lungs of slaughtered pigs have to be used with carefulness.

TI  == detection of respiratory pathogens in porcine lung tissue and lavage fluid.
AB  == the objective of this study was to compare the detection rate of bacterial agents in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf), taken without visual control, to that in  affected lung tissue obtained from the same pig at necropsy. balf and affected lung tissue were examined for mycoplasma hyopneumoniae using pcr, and standard cultural methods were used for actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis. all pigs with a history of respiratory symptoms were submitted as live animals for routine diagnostic examination. in each animal the site of lavage, marked by injecting methylene blue, differed from the site of pneumonic lesions.  m. hyopneumoniae was detected more frequently in lung tissue than in balf in cases with moderate or severe lung lesions. the detection rates of m. hyopneumoniae were higher in the balf of pigs with mild lesions. cultural examination of balf was at least as satisfactory as affected lung tissue for detecting b. bronchiseptica, h. parasuis and p. multocida.

TI  == serological characterization of haemophilus parasuis isolates from china.
AB  == from september 2002 to december 2004, a total of 281 strains of haemophilus parasuis were isolated from 17 provinces of china. all these isolates were serotyped by both the gel diffusion (gd) and the indirect haemagglutination (iha) tests. by combining the gd and iha results, serovar 4 (24.2%) and serovar 5 (19.2%) were the most prevalent serovars, followed by serovars 13 (12.5%), 14 (7.1%) and 12 (6.8%), while 12.1% of the isolates could not be assigned to a serovar (nontypable). a comparison of the number of isolates obtained from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis with those obtained from swine with polyserositis revealed an increased frequency of serovar 4 and a significantly decreased frequency of serovar 13 among isolates from the respiratory tract of swine without polyserositis, whereas the frequency of isolation of serovars 5, 12, 14 and nontypable from swine with or without polyserositis were similar. co-infection of h. parasuis and other bacterial agents was studied in 183 cases examined from june 2003 to december 2004. streptococcus suis (30.6%; 56), escherichia coli (21.9%; 40), bordetella bronchiseptica (21.3%; 39) and pasteurella multocida (14.2%; 26) were the bacterial agents frequently co-isolated with h. parasuis in china.

AB  == the prevalence of different pathogens detected in combination with porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv-2) was studied retrospectively in field cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (pmws) diagnosed at the iowa state university veterinary diagnostic laboratory, ames, iowa, between january 2000, and september 2001. the presence of pcv-2 antigen in lymphoid tissues and/or lung, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, together with moderate to severe lymphoid depletion and/or granulomatous lymphadenitis, was used as the criteria for the diagnosis of pmws. a total of 484 cases fulfilled these criteria. most of the cases (294/369) of pmws occurred in pigs between the ages of 8 and 18 weeks,  with a peak at 10 weeks of age. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus was detected in 51.9% of the cases, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 35.5%, bacterial septicemia in 14.0%, bacterial pneumonia in 7.6%, swine influenza virus in 5.4%, and pcv-2 alone in 1.9%. in cases with bacterial septicemia the most frequently isolated pathogen was streptococcus suis. in cases with bacterial pneumonia, pasteurella multocida was the most prevalent.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == tiamulin activity against fastidious and nonfastidious veterinary and human bacterial isolates: initial development of in vitro susceptibility test methods.
AB  == tiamulin is a pleuromutilin derivative used in veterinary practice for the control and specific therapy of infections in swine. this report summarizes studies to establish standardized susceptibility testing methods, interpretive criteria, and reagent details for use in veterinary methods recently developed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) (standards m31-a and m37-a, nccls, wayne, pa., 1999). a total of 636 fastidious and nonfastidious  animal and human pathogens were processed by using media and procedures described by the nccls. tiamulin disk diffusion tests used a 30-microg disk concentration,  and the proposed mic breakpoints corresponding to levels achievable in animal target tissues (lung) were < or =4 microg/ml for susceptibility and > or =32 microg/ml for resistance. correlate zone diameters for specific nonfastidious species were as follows: for pasteurella multocida and staphylococci tested on mueller-hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =19 mm and resistance at < or =11 mm, and for actinobacillus suis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, and streptococcus suis tested on enriched chocolate mueller-hinton agar, susceptibility at > or =16 mm and resistance at < or =8 mm. when actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was tested, a  susceptibility breakpoint of < or =16 microg/ml (> or =9 mm) was suggested for veterinary fastidious medium broth and enriched chocolate mueller-hinton agar. absolute categorical agreement between nccls dilution and disk diffusion test results with these criteria ranged from 90.5 to 96.2%. tiamulin susceptibility testing methods appear to be accurate in their categorical classification for indicated species, and their availability will allow immediate testing of animal  isolates to guide therapy via appropriate levels of dosing and to monitor the development of resistance for agents in this unique class.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of porcine respiratory pathogens to tilmicosin.
AB  == bacterial isolates obtained from swine with various clinical diseases were tested for susceptibility to tilmicosin by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and kirby-bauer disk diffusion tests using national committee on clinical laboratory  standards methodology. the tilmicosin mic90 was < or =0.125 microg/ml for erysiopelothrix rhusiopathiae, < or = 1 microg/ml for haemophilus parasuis isolates, 8 microg/ml for actinobacillus suis and pasteurella multocida type a, 16 microg/ml for toxigenic and nontoxigenic p. multocida type d, 64 microg/ml for bordetella bronchiseptica, and >128 microg/ml for staphylococcus hyicus and streptococcus suis. the results of disk diffusion testing matched well with the mic results for each pathogen. this in vitro survey of tilmicosin activity against various swine isolates suggests that further clinical evaluation of tilmicosin in swine may be warranted for disease associated with e. rhusiopathiae, h. parasuis, and a. suis but not b. bronchiseptica, s. suis, or s. hyicus.

TI  == cleavage of influenza a virus h1 hemagglutinin by swine respiratory bacterial proteases.
AB  == cleavage of influenza a virus hemagglutinin (ha) is required for expression of fusion activity and virus entry into cells. extracellular proteases are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage activation of avirulent avian and mammalian influenza viruses and contribute to pathogenicity and tissue tropism. the relative contributions of host and microbial proteases to cleavage activation in natural infection remain to be established. we examined 23 respiratory bacterial pathogens and 150 aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from the nasal cavities of pigs for proteolytic activity. no evidence of secreted proteases was  found for the bacterial pathogens, including haemophilus parasuis, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, bordetella bronchiseptica, and streptococcus suis. proteolytic bacteria were isolated from 7 of 11 swine nasal samples and included staphylococcus chromogenes, staphylococcus hyicus, aeromonas caviae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and enterococcus sp. only p. aeruginosa secreted a protease, elastase, that cleaved influenza virus ha. however, compared to trypsin, the site of cleavage by elastase was shifted one amino acid in the carboxy-terminal direction and resulted in inactivation of the virus. under the conditions of this study, we identified several bacterial isolates from the respiratory tracts of pigs that secrete proteases in vitro. however, none of these proteolytic isolates demonstrated direct cleavage activation of influenza virus ha.

TI  == species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
AB  == siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of  the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter  inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the  intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or  lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated  to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.

TI  == growth and microbial flora of nonmedicated, segregated, early weaned pigs from a  commercial swine operation.
AB  == objective: to determine whether segregated, early weaned pigs have better growth  performance and different microbial flora than those pigs raised on-site. design: prospective, observational study. animals: pigs from a commercial operation that  were known to be infected with several common swine pathogens. procedure: pigs (7 to 10 days old) were weaned and segregated from the farm of origin and compared with littermate control pigs (14 to 17 days old) that were weaned and raised on-site. pig weight was measured and microbial flora were isolated at 14-day intervals for 84 days, beginning when the pigs were 7 to 10 days old. results: at 50 days of age, the segregated, early weaned pigs had a mean weight of 23.7 kg, compared with a mean weight of 12.5 kg for control pigs. pasteurella multocida was isolated from fewer segregated, early weaned pigs than from controls. signs of mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infection were detected in control pigs but not in segregated early weaned pigs. clinical, serologic, or bacteriologic signs of early postnatal vertical transmission of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were not detected in either group. clinical implication: vertical transmission of m hyopneumoniae was prevented by weaning pigs at 7 to 10 days of age and segregating them off-site, without the use of medication. although medicated controls were not compared, results from this herd revealed that use of antibiotics is not the most important factor for disease control in segregated, early weaning programs. minimizing antibiotic use in disease-control protocols reduces costs as well as removes the need for extra-label drugs.

AB  == a 2-phase study was conducted to evaluate the ability of the neb-1 strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) to potentiate common  bacterial pathogens of swine. in phase i, 25 of 50 4-5-week-old specific-pathogen-free (spf) pigs were exposed to neb-1 prrsv (day 0). seven days after virus inoculation, 8 groups received 1 of 4 bacterial pathogens: haemophilus parasuis, streptococcus suis, salmonella cholerasuis, and pasteurella multocida. the ability of neb-1 prrsv to produce clinical disease, viremia, neutralizing antibody, gross and microscopic lesions and to potentiate bacterial  pathogens was assessed. response to neb-1 prrsv was similar among inoculated pigs; prolonged hyperthermia, lethargy, mild to moderate dyspnea, and cutaneous erythema were consistent clinical signs. no clinical differences were observed in groups after bacterial challenge. virus was isolated from serum at weekly intervals through the end of the study, and all prrsv-inoculated pigs had seroconverted by study termination. two of 5 pigs died in non-prrsv-inoculated groups challenged with h. parasuis and streptococcus suis. mortality in prrsv-infected pigs was limited to 1 of 5 pigs from the salmonella cholerasuis-challenged group. gross lesions were seen in pigs dying after inoculation in h. parasuis- and streptococcus suis-inoculated groups, in salmonella cholerasuis- and p. multocida-challenged pigs, and in 1 non-prrsv-inoculated control pig. microscopic lesions consisted of mild to moderate proliferative interstitial pneumonia, nonsuppurative myocarditis, lymphoid hyperplasia, and nonsuppurative encephalitis in prrsv-inoculated pigs. findings in phase i indicated that neb-1 prrsv does not potentiate bacterial disease while inducing consistent clinical signs, viremia, seroconversion, and microscopic lesions.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome: clinical disease, pathology and immunosuppression.
AB  == porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (prrs) was first known as blue-eared pig disease in the united kingdom and the causative agent as 'lelystad virus'. the disease is characterised by very variable clinical signs, including reproductive failure and respiratory disease. the respiratory syndrome is often associated with severe infection with secondary bacterial agents including pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis and streptococcus suis. however, some seropositive herds show no clinical signs of disease. the secondary infections may be facilitated by the destruction of circulating lymphocytes, by the destruction of the mucociliary clearance system and, most importantly, by a large reduction in the numbers of alveolar macrophages. the clinical syndrome observed  in a herd may therefore depend in part upon the other diseases present.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection in swine: a retrospective study of 256 cases. part ii. clinical signs, gross and microscopic lesions, and coexisting microorganisms.
AB  == a retrospective study of 256 cases of naturally acquired streptococcus suis infections in swine submitted to the indiana animal disease diagnostic laboratory from 1985 to 1989 was undertaken to describe the clinical signs, lesions, and coexisting organisms associated with s. suis serotypes 1-8 and 1/2. infected pigs generally had clinical signs and gross lesions referable to either the respiratory system or to the central nervous system (cns), but not both. neurologic signs were inversely related to gross lesions in the respiratory tract (r2 = -0.19, p = 0.003), as were respiratory signs and gross lesions in the cns (r2 = -0.19, p = 0.003). suppurative bronchopneumonia was the most common gross lesion observed (55.2%, overall). fibrinous and/or suppurative pleuritis, epicarditis, pericarditis, arthritis, peritonitis, and polyserositis were also reported. in 68% of the pigs, other bacteria in addition to s. suis were isolated. escherichia coli (35.0%) and pasteurella multocida (30.0%) were the most commonly recovered bacterial agents. mycoplasma and viral agents were identified less often, and their role in the development of streptococcosis was difficult to assess. in pigs infected with serotypes 2-5, 7, 8, and 1/2, suppurative meningitis with suppurative or nonsuppurative encephalitis, suppurative bronchopneumonia, fibrinopurulent epicarditis, multifocal myocarditis, and cardiac vasculitis were the most common microscopic lesions observed, whereas pigs infected with serotype 1 generally presented with suppurative meningitis and interstitial pneumonia. microscopic lesions were morphologically similar among serotypes and were also similar to those reported with other pyogenic bacteria.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == colonization of the pharyngeal tonsil and respiratory tract of the gnotobiotic pig by a toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida type d.
AB  == seven-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated intranasally with pasteurella multocida and euthanatized 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after inoculation. tissues from the oropharynx and respiratory tract of pigs were cultured quantitatively and analyzed microscopically. pigs remained afebrile and alert, except one that died  of acute fibrinopurulent pneumonia. pasteurella multocida was isolated in greatest numbers from the pharyngeal tonsils, but only in low numbers from turbinate, trachea, lung, spleen, and liver. significant histologic changes were  limited to the tonsil. infected pigs developed mild tonsillitis with lymphocytic  hyperplasia, and accumulation of cell debris and bacteria in crypts. capsular antigens of p. multocida, identified on tissue sections with rabbit anti-capsular polysaccharide antibody and immunocytochemical reagents, were confined to the crypt lumen. ultrastructurally, bacteria were free within crypt material or within phagosomes of macrophages or neutrophils. in a second experiment, 5-day-old pigs were infected with streptococcus suis type 2, followed by toxigenic pasteurella multocida at 7 days of age; one pig died of streptococcal septicemia. pigs developed a mild tonsillitis, and both bacteria were cultured from the tonsillar crypts for up to 14 days after infection. these studies show that a toxigenic strain of pasteurella multocida, which is a causative agent of atrophic rhinitis, can colonize the tonsil and respiratory tract of gnotobiotic pigs for up to 14 days. in addition, colonization can occur concurrently with streptococcus suis type 2.

TI  == an abattoir survey of pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughter weight swine from 9 selected herds. iv. bacteriological findings in chronic pneumonic lesions.
AB  == a total of 855 pig lungs were collected at slaughter and evaluated macroscopically. bacteriological examinations were carried out on tissue samples  from chronic pleuropneumonic lesions (n = 196) and from chronic bronchopneumonic  lesions with suppuration (n = 14). samples from normal lung tissue (n = 22) were  also included. pasteurella multocida was isolated from 54%, actinobacillus (haemophilus) pleuropneumoniae from 11%, and streptococcus spp. from 14% of the pneumonic lesions, respectively. from normal lung tissue p. multocida was isolated from 3 (14%) of the samples, a. pleuropneumoniae was not recovered and streptococci were isolated from only 1 (5%) of these samples. the above mentioned bacterial species were recovered either in pure cultures or mixed with various other microbes. a total of 109 p. multocida strains were further characterized by capsular serotyping and testing for production of dermonecrotic toxin. ninety-nine (91%) of the strains were capsular type a 10 (9%) were type d. out of the type a and the type d strains 94% and 90% were toxigenic, respectively. most  of the a. pleuropneumoniae strains were serotype 2. strains of serotypes 1 and 7  were also identified. the majority of the streptococci were identified as either  streptococcus suis or streptococcus dysgalactiae. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from 14% of the lesions and anaerobic bacteria from 18%, respectively. the significance of the various bacterial species in relation to the development  of chronic pneumonic lesions is discussed. special attention is paid to p. multocida, and it is concluded that this bacterial species is probably of importance for the development of both types of chronic pneumonias.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection in swine. a sixteen month study.
AB  == a total of 349 isolates of streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. among typable isolates, serotype  2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). the majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure  culture. other isolates were found in conjunction with pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. typable s. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. no obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of s. suis could be detected.

TI  == in vitro activity of five tetracyclines and some other antimicrobial agents against four porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of five tetracyclines and ten other antimicrobial agents were determined for four porcine bacterial respiratory tract pathogens by the agar dilution method. for the following oxytetracycline-susceptible strains, the mic50 ranges of the tetracyclines were:  p. multocida (n = 17) 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml; b. bronchiseptica (n = 20) 0.25-1.0 micrograms/ml; h. pleuropneumoniae (n = 20) 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml; s. suis type  2 (n = 20) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml. for 19 oxytetracycline-resistant p. multocida strains the mic50 of the tetracyclines varied from 64 micrograms/ml for oxytetracycline to 0.5 micrograms/ml for minocycline. strikingly, minocycline showed no cross-resistance with oxytetracycline, tetracycline, chlortetracycline  and doxycycline in p. multocida and in h. pleuropneumoniae. moreover, in susceptible strains minocycline showed the highest in vitro activity followed by  doxycycline. low mic50 values were observed for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, flumequine, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against p. multocida and h. pleuropneumoniae. b. bronchiseptica was moderately susceptible or resistant to these compounds. as expected tiamulin, lincomycin, tylosin and spiramycin were not active against h. pleuropneumoniae. except for flumequine, the mic50 values of nine antimicrobial agents were low for s. suis type 2. six strains of this species showed resistance to the macrolides and lincomycin.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of sulfonamides against some porcine pathogens.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of sulfonamides were determined against bordetella bronchiseptica (n = 10), pasteurella multocida (n = 10), haemophilus pleuropneumoniae (n = 20), and streptococcus suis (n = 10) strains isolated from pigs with atrophic rhinitis, pneumonia, or meningitis. sulfonamides tested in an agar dilution method were sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamethazine, sulfadoxine, sulfisoxazole, sulfamerazine, sulfamethoxazole, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfanilamide, sulfatroxazole, and sulfisomidine. results indicated that monotherapy of s suis infections with sulfonamides should not be encouraged because the mic50 of all sulfonamides investigated was greater than 32 micrograms/ml. the mic50 of the sulfonamides against b bronchiseptica ranged from 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml, against p multocida  from 2 to 32 micrograms/ml, and against h pleuropneumoniae from 8 to 64 micrograms/ml. the mic50 of sulfachloropyridazine, sulfadiazine, sulfadimethoxine, sulfamerazine, and sulfamethoxazole for the gram-negative bacteria did not exceed 16 micrograms/ml. among these compounds, sulfamethoxazole had the highest activity. the frequently prescribed sulfamethazine had an overall low antimicrobial activity.

TI  == kill kinetics of the cephalosporin antibiotics cephalexin and cefuroxime against  bacteria of veterinary importance.
AB  == kill kinetic studies for two cephalosporin antibiotics, cephalexin and cefuroxime were carried out against veterinary strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, streptococcus suis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and a laboratory culture of staphylococcus aureus. in more than 90 per cent of cases a kill of more than 99 per cent was achieved within four hours of antibiotic treatment at concentrations of 2 or 4 micrograms/ml. although cefuroxime was effective at lower concentrations than cephalexin the rates of kill of the two antibiotics were comparable. the results are discussed in relation to in vivo dosage regimens.
