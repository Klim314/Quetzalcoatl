TI  == resistance determinant erm(x) is borne by transposon tn5432 in bifidobacterium thermophilum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis.
AB  == the erm(x) gene from erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant bifidobacterium strains was characterised by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, including flanking regions. results suggest that the resistance determinant was part of transposon tn5432 that has been described in several opportunistic pathogens such as corynebacterium striatum and propionibacterium acnes.
