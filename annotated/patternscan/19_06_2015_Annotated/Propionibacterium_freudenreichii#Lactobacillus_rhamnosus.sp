TI  == role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  == meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature  search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment  of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase  production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in  vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with  s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between  probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.

TI  == effects of probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js supplementation on intestinal and systemic markers of inflammation in apoe*3leiden mice consuming a high-fat diet.
AB  == a high-fat diet disturbs the composition and function of the gut microbiota and generates local gut-associated and also systemic responses. intestinal mast cells, for their part, secrete mediators which play a role in the orchestration of physiological and immunological functions of the intestine. probiotic bacteria, again, help to maintain the homeostasis of the gut microbiota by protecting the gut epithelium and regulating the local immune system. in the present study, we explored the effects of two probiotic bacteria, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (gg) and propionibacterium freudenreichii spp. shermanii js (pjs), on high fat-fed apoe*3leiden mice by estimating the mast cell numbers and the immunoreactivity of tnf-alpha and il-10 in the intestine, as well as plasma levels of several markers of inflammation and parameters of lipid metabolism. we  found that mice that received gg and pjs exhibited significantly lower numbers of intestinal mast cells compared with control mice. pjs lowered intestinal immunoreactivity of tnf-alpha, while gg increased intestinal il-10. pjs was also  observed to lower the plasma levels of markers of inflammation including vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and also the amount of gonadal adipose tissue. gg lowered alanine aminotransferase, a marker of hepatocellular activation. collectively, these data demonstrate that probiotic gg and pjs tend to down-regulate both intestinal and systemic pro-inflammatory changes induced by a  high-fat diet in this humanised mouse model.

TI  == interaction of campylobacter spp. and human probiotics in chicken intestinal mucus.
AB  == campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial food-borne diarrhoeal disease throughout the world. the principal risk of human contamination is handling and consumption of contaminated poultry meat. to colonize poultry, campylobacter adheres to and persists in the mucus layer that covers the intestinal epithelium. inhibiting adhesion to the mucus could prevent colonization of the intestine. the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the protective effect of defined commercial human probiotic strains on the adhesion of campylobacter spp. to chicken intestinal mucus, in a search for alternatives to antibiotics to control  this food-borne pathogen. the probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and a starter culture strain lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis adhered well to chicken intestinal mucus and were  able to reduce the binding of campylobacter spp. when the mucus was colonized with the probiotic strain before contacting the pathogen. human-intended probiotics could be useful as prophylactics in poultry feeding for controlling campylobacter spp. colonization.

TI  == human bocavirus in the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children.
AB  == objectives: human bocavirus (hbov) is frequently identified in children with respiratory tract infections, and its role in acute otitis media (aom) has been suggested. the disease associations for the closely related bocaviruses hbov2-4 remain unknown. increasing evidence shows that probiotics may reduce the risk of  aom of viral origin. objectives of the study was to examine the prevalence and persistence of bocaviruses in consecutive nasopharyngeal samples (nps) of otitis-prone children, and whether an association exists between hbov and the child's characteristics, respiratory symptoms, and aom pathogens, and whether probiotics reduce the occurrence of hbov. methods: in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 6-month intervention study, 269 otitis-prone children (aged 9 months to 5.6 years), consumed daily either one capsule of probiotics (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) or placebo. after a clinical examination and nps collected at three-time points, the presence and persistence  of hbov1-4 dna in nps was determined by rt-qpcr at the baseline, after 3, and 6 months. results: a high load (>10,000 copies/ml) of hbov dna was detected in 26 (17.1%) of 152 children, and 16 (10.5%) showed a prolonged presence of hbov for at least 3 months. none had dna of hbov2-4. higher number of siblings associated  with increased hbov prevalence (p=0.029). prevalence or persistence of hbov was not significantly associated with other characteristics, respiratory symptoms, or aom pathogens. probiotic intervention significantly reduced the number of hbov dna-positive samples (probiotic vs. placebo: 6.4% vs. 19.0%, or=0.25, ci 95%=0.07-0.94, p=0.039). conclusions: hbov, but not hbov2-4, dna occurs often in  the nasopharynx of otitis-prone children, and may persist for 3-6 months. probiotic treatment possibly reduced the presence of hbov.

TI  == a probiotic mixture including galactooligosaccharides decreases fecal beta-glucosidase activity but does not affect serum enterolactone concentration in men during a two-week intervention.
AB  == a high serum concentration of enterolactone, an enterolignan produced by colonic  microbiota from precursors in cereals, vegetables, and fruits, is associated with reduced risk of acute coronary events. probiotics and prebiotics modify colonic metabolism and may affect the serum enterolactone concentration. the effects of a probiotic mixture alone and with galactooligosaccharides (gos) on serum enterolactone concentration and fecal metabolism were investigated in 18 healthy  men. participants received 3 interventions, each for 2 wk: 1) probiotics [lactobacillus rhamnosus strains gg (lgg) and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium breve bb99, for a total amount of 2 x 10(10) cfu/d]; 2) probiotics and gos 3.8 g/d; 3) probiotics, gos, and rye bread (minimum 120 g/d). serum enterolactone and fecal dry weight, enzyme activities, ph, scfa, lactic acid bacteria, bifidobacteria, propionibacteria, and the strains lgg and lc705 were determined. the serum enterolactone concentration  (nmol/l) tended to be decreased from baseline [mean (95% ci) 18.6 (10.8-26.4)] by probiotics alone [15.2 (7.8-22.7); p = 0.095], was not significantly affected by  probiotics with gos [21.5 (13.2-29.8)], and was increased by probiotics with gos  and rye bread [24.6 (15.4-33.7); p < 0.05]. probiotics alone did not affect fecal beta-glucosidase activity and bifidobacteria, but probiotics with gos decreased beta-glucosidase activity and increased bifidobacteria compared with baseline (p  < 0.05) and with probiotics alone (p < 0.01). in conclusion, this probiotic mixture with or without gos does not significantly affect serum enterolactone concentration. because probiotics with gos decreased fecal beta-glucosidase activity but not serum enterolactone, the reduced fecal beta-glucosidase, within  the range of activities measured, does not seem to limit the formation of enterolactone.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates fcer1 and hrh4 expression in human mast cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination  on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. methods: human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with lactobacillus rhamnosus  (l. rhamnosus) gg (lgg((r))), l. rhamnosus lc705 (lc705), propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an affymetrix genechip((r)) human genome u133 plus 2.0  array. the gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with gorilla gene enrichment analysis and visualization tool and mev multiexperiment viewer-tool. results: lgg and lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity ige receptor subunits alpha and gamma (fcer1a and fcer1g, respectively) and histamine h4 receptor. lgg, lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a  pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (il)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as il-10, were upregulated. conclusion: certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity ige and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.

TI  == persistence of probiotic strains in the gastrointestinal tract when administered  as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese.
AB  == most clinical studies of probiotics use freeze-dried, powdered bacteria or bacteria packed in capsules. however, probiotics are commercially available in various food matrices, which may affect their persistence in the gastrointestinal tract. the objective of the study was to compare oral and faecal recovery during  and after administration of a combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and bifidobacterium  animalis subsp. lactis bb12 as capsules, yoghurt, or cheese. this randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial (n=36) included a 4-week run-in, 2-week intervention, and 3-week follow-up period. participants consumed 10(10)cfu/day of probiotic combination and provided saliva and faecal samples before, during, and  after the intervention. strain-specific real-time pcr was used to quantify the strains. l. rhamnosus gg was the only probiotic strain regularly recovered in saliva samples. during the intervention period it was recovered in the saliva of  88% of the volunteers at least once. no difference was found between the yoghurt  and cheese groups. at the end of the intervention, l. rhamnosus gg and lc705 counts were high in faecal samples of all product groups (8.08 and 8.67log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). there was no matrix effect on strain quantity in  faeces or the recovery time after ceasing the intervention. for p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and b. animalis subsp. lactis bb12, a matrix effect was found at the end of the intervention (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and in the recovery time during follow-up (p<0.05 for both). yoghurt yielded the highest faecal quantity of js and bb12 strains (8.01 and 9.89log(10) genome copies/g, respectively). the results showed that the administration matrix did not influence the faecal quantity of lactobacilli, but affected faecal counts of propionibacteria and bifidobacteria that were lower when consumed in cheese. thus, the consumption of probiotics in yoghurt matrix is highly suitable for studying potential health benefits and capsules provide a comparable means of administration when the viability of the strain in the capsule product is confirmed.

TI  == effect of a multispecies probiotic supplement on quantity of irritable bowel syndrome-related intestinal microbial phylotypes.
AB  == background: probiotics can alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs), possibly by stabilizing the intestinal microbiota. our aim was to determine whether ibs-associated bacterial alterations were reduced during multispecies probiotic intervention consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l.  rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the intervention has previously been shown to successfully alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms of ibs. methods: the faecal microbiotas of 42 ibs subjects participating in a placebo-controlled double-blind multispecies probiotic intervention were analysed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr). eight bacterial targets within the gastrointestinal microbiota with a putative ibs association were measured. results: a phylotype with 94% similarity to ruminococcus torques remained abundant in the placebo group, but was decreased in the probiotic group during the intervention (p = 0.02 at 6 months). in addition, the clostridial phylotype,  clostridium thermosuccinogenes 85%, was stably elevated during the intervention (p = 0.00 and p = 0.02 at 3 and 6 months, respectively). the bacterial alterations detected were in accordance with previously discovered alleviation of symptoms. conclusions: the probiotic supplement was thus shown to exert specific  alterations in the ibs-associated microbiota towards the bacterial 16s rdna phylotype quantities described previously for subjects free of ibs. these changes may have value as non-invasive biomarkers in probiotic intervention studies.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705 together with propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp  shermanii js administered in capsules is ineffective in lowering serum lipids.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to examine the effect of the administration  of lactobacillus rhamnosus strain lc705 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp  shermanii strain js in capsules on serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in mildly or moderately hypercholesterolemic men. methods: thirty-eight basically healthy men, mean age 42 years (range 24-55), mean cholesterol 6.2 mmol/l (5.3-8.2 mmol/l), participated in this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study with 4-week treatment periods. the subjects consumed daily two probiotic capsules containing viable lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii js (2 x 10(10) colony forming units of each strain daily) or two placebo capsules. serum lipids  were assessed before the intervention, at the end of both 4-week treatment periods, and 2 weeks after the second treatment period. dietary and lifestyle habits were carefully monitored. results: all the subjects completed the study, and the probiotic capsules were well tolerated. dietary habits and the intake of  energy and nutrients, such as saturated fatty acids and cholesterol, did not differ between the treatment groups. no changes in total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, ldl cholesterol or triglyceride levels were observed during the consumption of the probiotics compared to placebo. conclusions: the administration of lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii js did not affect serum lipids.

TI  == the influence of lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705 together with propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js on potentially carcinogenic bacterial activity in human colon.
AB  == the bacterial enzymes beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and urease may contribute to the development of colon cancer by generating carcinogens. a reduction in the activity of these enzymes by certain lactic acid bacteria is considered to be beneficial. this study examined fecal beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase, and urease activities during administration of lactobacillus  rhamnosus lc705 (lc705) together with propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii js (pjs). thirty-eight healthy men participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study with treatment periods of 4 weeks. subjects consumed daily bacterial or placebo capsules. bacterial capsules contained viable lc705 and pjs (2x10(10) cfu of each strain daily). the activities of beta-glucosidase, beta-glucuronidase and urease, recovery of lc705 and pjs, and counts of total lactobacilli and propionibacteria  were determined from feces. the mean fecal counts of total lactobacilli and propionibacteria as well as strains lc705 and pjs were significantly increased during the administration of bacteria (3.5-, 13-, 80- and 11-fold, respectively). beta-glucosidase activity decreased by 10% (p=0.18) and urease activity by 13% (p=0.16) during bacterial supplementation versus placebo. the change in beta-glucosidase activity was negatively correlated with the change in propionibacteria counts (r=-0.350, p=0.039), being -2.68 versus 0.94 nmol/min/mg  protein in subjects with increased and unchanged/decreased propionibacteria, respectively (p=0.003). to conclude, the administration of lc705 and pjs was followed by an increase in the fecal counts of lactobacilli and propionibacteria  and a decrease in the activity of beta-glucosidase with increasing counts of propionibacteria.

TI  == effects of copper supplement on growth and viability of strains used as starters  and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture.
AB  == aims: to determine the effects of supplemented copper (cu2+) on growth and viability of strains used as starters and adjunct cultures for emmental cheese manufacture. methods and results: thirteen strains belonging to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus or propionibacterium freudenreichii species were exposed to various  copper concentrations in the proper growth medium at relevant growth temperatures, and the effects of supplemented copper on bacterial growth and cell viability were determined by optical density and ph measurements, also by platings. among the species considered, l. delbrueckii was the most copper resistant and s. thermophilus the most sensitive to copper. anaerobic conditions  increased this sensitivity significantly. there was also a considerable amount of variation in copper resistance at strain level. conclusions: copper resistance is both a species- and strain-dependent property and may reflect variability in copper-binding capacities by cell wall components among species and strains. in addition, the chemical state of copper may be involved. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that copper resistance is a highly variable property among starter and adjunct strains, and this variability should be considered when strains are selected for emmental cheese manufacture.

TI  == long-term safety and impact on infection rates of postnatal probiotic and prebiotic (synbiotic) treatment: randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == objective: live probiotic bacteria and dietary prebiotic oligosaccharides (together termed synbiotics) increasingly are being used in infancy, but evidence of long-term safety is lacking. in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, we studied the safety and long-term effects of feeding synbiotics to newborn infants. methods: between november 2000 and march 2003, pregnant mothers  carrying infants at high risk for allergy were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of 4 probiotic species (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99, and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp shermanii) or a placebo for 4 weeks before delivery. their infants received the same probiotics with 0.8 g of galactooligosaccharides, or a placebo, daily for 6 months after birth. safety data were obtained from clinical examinations and interviews at follow-up visits at ages 3, 6, and 24 months and from questionnaires at ages 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. growth data were collected at each time point. results: of the 1018 eligible infants, 925 completed the 2-year  follow-up assessment. infants in both groups grew normally. we observed no difference in neonatal morbidity, feeding-related behaviors (such as infantile colic), or serious adverse events between the study groups. during the 6-month intervention, antibiotics were prescribed less often in the synbiotic group than  in the placebo group (23% vs 28%). throughout the follow-up period, respiratory infections occurred less frequently in the synbiotic group (geometric mean: 3.7 vs 4.2 infections). conclusion: feeding synbiotics to newborn infants was safe and seemed to increase resistance to respiratory infections during the first 2 years of life.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic combination on helicobacter pylori infection in vitro.
AB  == probiotic bacteria alleviate many gastrointestinal symptoms, but the current trend of combining bacteria for additional benefit may make their effects more complex. we characterize four probiotics and their combination in terms of pathogen adhesion, barrier function, cell death, and inflammatory response in helicobacter pylori-infected epithelial cells. h. pylori-infected caco-2 cells were pretreated with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, bifidobacterium breve bb99, or all four organisms in combination. we evaluated the adhesion of h. pylori by in situ immunofluorescence; epithelial barrier function by measurement of transepithelial resistance; apoptosis by measurement of caspase 3 activation; cell membrane leakage by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release; and inflammation by measurement of interleukin-8 (il-8), il-10, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), and leukotriene b(4) (ltb(4)) release. all probiotics inhibited h. pylori adhesion. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js, and the combination inhibited h. pylori-induced cell membrane leakage. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and the combination initially improved epithelial barrier function but increased the h. pylori-induced barrier  deterioration after incubation for 24 to 42 h. l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js inhibited h. pylori-induced il-8 release, whereas l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and b. breve bb99 suppressed pge(2) release. none of these anti-inflammatory effects persisted when the probiotics were used in combination. the combination thus increased the levels of il-8, pge(2), and ltb(4) released from h. pylori-infected epithelial cells. the proinflammatory actions of the individual components dominated the anti-inflammatory effects when the probiotic bacteria were used in combination. our results stress that the therapeutic response can be optimized if probiotic strains are characterized before they are used in combination.

TI  == probiotic intervention has strain-specific anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the effects of three potentially anti-inflammatory probiotic bacteria from three different genera on immune variables in healthy adults in a clinical setting based on previous in vitro characterization of cytokine responses. methods: a total of 62 volunteers participated in this randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group intervention study. the volunteers were randomized to receive a milk-based drink containing either lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12 (bb12), or propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) or a placebo  drink for 3 wk. venous blood and saliva samples were taken at baseline and on d 1, 7 and 21. fecal samples were collected at baseline and at the end of intervention. results: the serum hscrp expressed as the median auc(0-21) (minus baseline) was 0.018 mg/l in the placebo group, -0.240 mg/l in the lgg group, 0.090 mg/l in the bb12 group and -0.085 mg/l in the pjs group (p = 0.014). in vitro production of tnf-alpha from in vitro cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) was significantly lower in subjects receiving lgg vs placebo. il-2 production from pbmc in the bb12 group was significantly lower compared with the  other groups. conclusion: in conclusion, probiotic bacteria have strain-specific  anti-inflammatory effects in healthy adults.

TI  == combining strains of lactic acid bacteria may reduce their toxin and heavy metal  removal efficiency from aqueous solution.
AB  == aims: the primary objective of this study was to compare the removal of cadmium,  lead, aflatoxin b1 and microcystin-lr from aqueous solution by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bbi99/e8, separately and in combination. methods and results: the removal of toxins and heavy metals was assessed in batch experiments. the removal of all compounds was observed to be strain specific. the removal of lead by a combination of all the strains used was observed to be lower than could be predicted from the removal by single strains (p < 0.05). a similar  trend was also observed with the other compounds studied. conclusions: the results show that the toxin-removal capacity of a combination of strains of lactic acid bacteria is not the sum of their individual capacities. therefore, pure single strains should be used when the goal is to remove single compounds. the use of combinations of strains may be beneficial when several compounds are removed together. this needs to be studied in future experiments. significance and impact of the study: lactic acid bacteria have been identified as potent tools for the decontamination of heavy metals, cyanotoxins and mycotoxins. the results of this study should be considered when selecting combinations of bacteria for the simultaneous removal of several toxic compounds.

TI  == clinical trial: multispecies probiotic supplementation alleviates the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and stabilizes intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is the most common diagnosis in gastroenterology. trials suggest certain probiotics to be beneficial. aim: to investigate the effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation (lactobacillus  rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb12) on abdominal symptoms, quality  of life, intestinal microbiota and inflammatory markers in irritable bowel syndrome. methods: eighty-six irritable bowel syndrome patients (rome ii criteria) participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled 5-month intervention. patients were randomized to receive daily either multispecies probiotic supplementation or placebo. irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality  of life, microarray-based intestinal microbiota stability (n = 20), serum cytokines and sensitive c-reactive protein were monitored. results: the composite irritable bowel syndrome score had at 5 months decreased 14 points (95% ci: -19 to -9) from baseline with the multispecies probiotic vs. three points (95% ci: -8 to 1) with placebo (p = 0.0083). especially, distension and abdominal pain were affected. a stabilization of the microbiota was observed, as the microbiota similarity index increased with the probiotic supplementation (1.9 +/- 3.1), while it decreased with placebo (-2.9 +/- 1.7). no differences were seen in c-reactive protein. conclusions: this multispecies probiotic seems to be an effective and safe option to alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, and  to stabilize the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == effects of multispecies probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota in irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == background: a multispecies probiotic has shown beneficial effects in irritable bowel syndrome. in addition, certain other probiotics have demonstrated advantageous effects, but the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. aim:  to investigate the mode of action of a multispecies probiotic consisting of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 by monitoring its effects on intestinal microbiota and markers of microbial activity. methods: a total of 55 irritable bowel syndrome patients participated in this placebo-controlled double-blind trial. subjects received either multispecies probiotic or placebo supplementation daily during a 6-month period. the composition of intestinal microbiota was analysed with real-time polymerase chain reaction, short-chain fatty acids with gas chromatography and enzymes with spectrophotometer. results: each supplemented probiotic strain was detected in faecal samples. intestinal microbiota remained stable during the trial, except for bifidobacterium spp., which increased in the placebo group and decreased in the probiotic group (p = 0.028). no changes in short-chain fatty acids occurred.  a decrease in ss-glucuronidase activity was detected in 67% of the subjects in the probiotic group vs. 38% in the placebo group (p = 0.06). conclusions: factors other than the microbial groups and metabolites studied herein seem responsible for the alleviation of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms by the multispecies probiotic.

TI  == development of new probiotics by strain combinations: is it possible to improve the adhesion to intestinal mucus?
AB  == we evaluated the ability of commercial probiotic strains (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99, and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) to adhere alone or in different combinations to immobilized mucus. probiotic combinations were clearly able to enhance the adhesion of l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js. for l. rhamnosus gg and p. freudenreichii js, all the combinations  significantly improved adhesion to intestinal mucus, from 29.7 to 34.9% and from  1.9 to 2.3%, respectively. the adhesion of l. rhamnosus lc705 was improved from 0 to 46.4%. the adhesion of b. breve 99 was improved only in combination with l. rhamnosus gg and p. freudenreichii js. our results suggest that probiotic combinations could increase the beneficial health effects as compared with individual strains. combinations of probiotic strains may therefore have synergistic adhesion effects, and such combinations also should be assessed in clinical studies.

AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  == effects of anti-helicobacter pylori treatment and probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota.
AB  == the aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the effect of recommended antimicrobial treatment of helicobacter pylori infection, consisting of clarithromycin, amoxicillin and lansoprazole, on intestinal microbiota and (ii) to determine the ability of a probiotic combination containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99 to prevent treatment-induced alterations in the intestinal microbiota. faecal samples were obtained from 39 h. pylori-infected patients randomised into two treatment groups. in addition, 19 h. pylori-negative volunteers were included in the study as a control group. samples were collected  before, during and after treatment and microbiota were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and culture. the quantities of the predominant bacterial groups were altered significantly in both groups and disturbances were seen even  9 weeks after treatment was complete. probiotics slightly counteracted the effects of anti-h. pylori treatment, seen as significantly less alterations in the total numbers of aerobes and lactobacilli/enterococci. at baseline, the composition of the microbiota between h. pylori-positive versus h. pylori-negative control individuals differed with regard to clostridia and the total number of anaerobes. the recommended treatment for h. pylori infection induces long-term disturbances in the intestinal microbiota. the probiotic combination appeared to result in only minor changes in the microbiota.

TI  == probiotic bacteria as potential detoxification tools: assessing their heavy metal binding isotherms.
AB  == dietary exposure to heavy metals may have detrimental effects on human and animal health, even at low concentrations. specific probiotic bacteria may have properties that enable them to bind toxins from food and water. we assessed the interaction of probiotic bacteria with cadmium and lead in vitro as an initial screening step to identify strains for heavy metal decontamination in food and intestinal models. binding isotherms for cadmium and lead were characterized for  lactobacillus rhamnosus lc-705, propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js and a mix of them used by the food industry. differences among the strains and their combinations in binding performance at a range of concentrations between 0.1 and 100 mg.l-1 were evaluated with the langmuir model for biosorption. the effects of ph, contact time, and viability on the binding capacities were also investigated. all strains and their combinations were found to bind cadmium and lead efficiently at low concentration ranges commonly observed in foods. however, the two strains and their combinations differed significantly in their maximum binding capacities and affinities represented by the langmuir constants qmax and  b, respectively. the binding seemed to occur instantaneously and in a ph-dependent manner, which can be perfectly described by a segmented linear-plateau model.

TI  == clinical studies on alleviating the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.
AB  == irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is one of the most common diagnoses in gastroenterology, but current therapies are inefficient. recent clinical trials suggest beneficial effects of certain probiotics in ibs. because of the heterogeneity of ibs a probiotic combination may be more efficient than a single  strain. we screened for optimal strains, and developed a multispecies probiotic combination consisting of l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, p. freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js and bifidobacterium breve bb99. the clinical efficacy of the probiotic combination was evaluated in ibs patients in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled six-month intervention. during six months the subjects received daily either probiotic supplementation or placebo. ibs symptoms were followed by symptom diaries. the probiotic supplementation demonstrated significant value in reducing ibs symptoms. at the end of the study period the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + rumbling) had reduced with 42% in probiotic group versus 6% for instance anti-inflammatory effects, balancing of the microbiota or motility-related effects induced by the probiotic. the probiotic activity may be enhanced by synergistic effects of the combination that each strain alone would not hold. in conclusion, we found a probiotic combination of lgg and three other strains to be effective in alleviating ibs symptoms.

TI  == protection mechanism of probiotic combination against human pathogens: in vitro adhesion to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the ability of commercial strains (l. rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, and p. freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) in combination with b.  breve 99 or b. lactis bb12 to inhibit, displace and compete with model pathogens  in order to test their influence on the adhesion of selected pathogens to immobilized human intestinal mucus. our results demonstrate that specific probiotic combinations are able to enhance the inhibition percentages of pathogens adhesion to intestinal mucus when compared to individual strains. this  suggests that combinations of probiotic strains are useful and more effective in  inhibition of pathogen adhesion than individual strains. such combinations should be assessed in clinical studies in subjects where the intestinal microbiota aberrancies have been identified.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus adheres to human intestinal mucus but can be displaced by certain lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == there is increasing evidence that staphylococcus aureus may colonize the intestinal tract, especially among hospitalized patients. as staph. aureus has been found to be associated with certain gastrointestinal diseases, it has become important to study whether this bacterium can colonize the intestinal tract and if so, whether it is possible to prevent colonization. adhesion is the first step in colonization; this study shows that staph. aureus adheres to mucus from resected human intestinal tissue. certain lactic acid bacteria (lab), mainly commercial probiotics, were able to reduce adhesion and viability of adherent staph. aureus. in displacement assays the amount of adherent staph. aureus in human intestinal mucus was reduced 39-44% by lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii. moreover, adherent lactobacillus reuteri, lc. lactis and p. freudenreichii reduced viability of adherent staph. aureus by 27-36%, depending on the strain, after 2 h incubation. this was probably due to the production of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide and possibly in the case of l. reuteri to the production of reuterin. this study shows for the first time that staph. aureus can adhere to human intestinal mucus and adherent bacteria can be displaced and killed by certain lab strains via in situ production of antimicrobial substances.

TI  == probiotic supplementation reduces a biomarker for increased risk of liver cancer  in young men from southern china.
AB  == background: in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that selected strains of probiotic bacteria can form tight complexes with aflatoxin b(1) and other carcinogens. objective: the aim of the present study was to determine whether administration of probiotic bacteria could block the intestinal absorption of aflatoxin b(1) and thereby lead to reduced urinary excretion of aflatoxin b(1)-n(7)-guanine (afb-n(7)-guanine), a marker for a biologically effective dose  of aflatoxin exposure. elevated urinary excretion of this aflatoxin-dna adduct is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. design: ninety healthy young men from guangzhou, china, were randomly assigned to 2 groups; one group received a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus lc705 and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii strains 2 times/d for 5 wk, and the other group received a placebo preparation. the subjects provided 4 urine samples: at baseline, at 3 and 5 wk after starting the supplementation, and at the end of the 5-wk postintervention period. results: the percentage of samples with negative afb-n(7)-guanine values tended to be higher in the probiotic group than in the placebo group during the 5-wk intervention period (odds ratio: 2.63, p = 0.052),  and a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of urinary afb-n(7)-guanine was observed in the probiotic group. the reduction was 36% at week 3 and 55% at week 5. the geometric means for the probiotic and placebo groups were 0.24 and 0.49 ng afb-n(7)-guanine/ml, respectively, during the intervention period (p = 0.005). conclusion: a probiotic supplement reduces the biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure and may thereby offer an effective dietary approach to decrease the risk of liver cancer.

TI  == aflatoxin b1 binding by a mixture of lactobacillus and propionibacterium: in vitro versus ex vivo.
AB  == aflatoxin b1 (afb) is a well-known carcinogen and reducing its bioavailability is of great interest for human and animal health. several probiotic bacteria are able to bind afb1 in vitro, including lactobacillus rhamnosus lc-705 and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js. a mixture of these two probiotics is used by the food and feed industry as biopreservative (bioprofit),  making it a promising candidate for future applications. consequently, this study aims to investigate the in vitro and ex vivo ability of this probiotic mixture to bind afb1. for in vitro experiments, probiotic mixture was suspended in an afb1 solution (5 microm), incubated for 1 to 30 min, centrifuged, and afb1 residues were quantitated in supernatant and pellet. for ex vivo experiments, duodenal loops of chicks were ligated and injected with either afb1 solution alone or probiotic mixture suspension and afb1 solution. lumen content was centrifuged and afb1 was quantitated in supernatant and pellet. additionally, afb1 was extracted  from duodenal tissue to calculate tissue uptake. in vitro, 57 to 66% of afb1 was  removed from the solution by the probiotic mixture, but only 38 to 47% could be extracted from the bacterial surface. in ex vivo experiments, only up to 25% of afb1 was bound by bacteria, and tissue uptake of afb1 was significantly reduced when probiotic bacteria were present in the duodenal loop. furthermore, the effect of intestinal mucus on the bacterial binding ability was investigated in vitro and was found to significantly reduce afb1 binding by the probiotic mixture. however, probiotic mixture could only retard but not prevent afb1 absorption in duodenal loops. further work needs to assess the potential of probiotics in different experimental setups.

TI  == a probiotic mixture alleviates symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome patients: a controlled 6-month intervention.
AB  == background: irritable bowel syndrome is a gastrointestinal disorder of unknown aetiology. the effect of probiotics in this syndrome remains unclear. aim: to investigate whether a probiotic mixture containing lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii  ssp. shermanii js is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms.  methods: a total of 103 patients fulfilling the rome i or ii criteria took part in this 6-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. the patients  received a probiotic capsule or a placebo capsule daily. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were recorded. results: at the end the total symptom score (abdominal pain + distension + flatulence + borborygmi) was 7.7 (95% ci: -13.9 to -1.6) points lower in the probiotic group (p = 0.015). this represents a median reduction of 42% in the symptom score of the probiotic group compared with 6% in the placebo group. in individual symptoms, borborygmi was milder in the probiotic group (p = 0.008), and for the rest of the symptoms there was a non-significant trend. conclusions: the results indicate that this probiotic mixture is effective in alleviating irritable bowel syndrome symptoms. considering the high prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome and the lack of effective therapies, even a slight reduction in symptoms could have positive public health consequences.

TI  == probiotic supplementation improves tolerance to helicobacter pylori eradication therapy--a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized pilot study.
AB  == background: h. pylori is the major cause of chronic gastritis, and a risk factor  for peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. aim: to investigate the effect of probiotic  supplementation on the tolerance and efficacy of h. pylori eradication treatment  in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. methods: a total of 338  volunteers were screened for h. pylori infection. the eligibility criteria were met by 47 subjects whose h. pylori infection was verified at the outset and re-evaluated after the treatment by the 13c-urea breath test and by enzyme immunoassay serology. the subjects were randomized to receive probiotic therapy (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosuslc705, bifidobacterium breve bb99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js) or a placebo during h. pylori eradication and for 3 weeks following the treatment, and recorded their daily symptoms in a standardized diary. results: when the frequencies of new or aggravated symptoms were evaluated, no significant differences were found between the two groups for individual symptoms. however, the probiotic group showed less  treatment-related symptoms as measured by the total symptom score change (p = 0.038) throughout the h. pylori eradication therapy in contrast to the placebo group. the h. pylori eradication rate was non-significantly higher in the group receiving probiotic therapy (91% vs. 79%, p = 0.42). in this group the recovery of probiotic bacteria in the faeces increased significantly (p < 0.001). conclusions: in this pilot study, probiotic supplementation did not diminish significantly the frequency of new or aggravated symptoms during h. pylori eradication. however, our data suggest an improved tolerance to the eradication treatment when total symptom severity was taken into account. furthermore, the results show that probiotic bacteria are able to survive in the gastrointestinal  tract despite the intensive antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == kinetics of adsorption and desorption of aflatoxin b1 by viable and nonviable bacteria.
AB  == the reactions involved in the binding (adsorption) and release (desorption) of aflatoxin b1 (afb1) to and from the surface of bacteria were investigated. viable and heat-killed lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. rhamnosus lc-705, and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing variable concentrations (0.0017 to 13.3 microg/ml) of afb1. the relationship between the bacterial surface hydrophobicity and the afb1 adsorption affinity was also investigated. a linear relationship was observed between the specific rate of afb1 adsorption and the afb1 concentration  for all bacteria. the nature of desorption of adsorbed afb1 was investigated by repetitive aqueous washes. a linear relationship was observed between the natural log value of the concentration of afb1 adsorbed and the number of washes for all  bacteria studied. the desorption constants were strain-dependent and were lower for heat-killed bacteria than for viable bacteria. heat treatment appears to alter the surface properties of the bacteria rather than expose new adsorption sites. no correlation was found between the hydrophobicity and the afb1 adsorption affinity.

TI  == removal of common fusarium toxins in vitro by strains of lactobacillus and propionibacterium.
AB  == this study was conducted to examine the ability of selected strains of lactobacillus and propionibacterium to remove common fusarium toxins, trichothecenes, from liquid media. the trichothecenes studied were deoxynivalenol (don), 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-acdon), nivalenol (niv), fusarenon (fx), diacetoxyscirpenol (das), t-2 toxin (t-2) and ht-2 toxin (ht-2). the lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg (lgg), lactobacillus rhamnosus strain lc-705 (lc-705) and propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii js (pjs) were incubated in pbs buffer containing 20 microg toxin ml(-1) for 1h at 37 degrees c, and after centrifugation the concentration of the toxins was measured in the supernatant fraction. both viable and heat-killed forms of lgg and pjs were more  efficient than lc-705 in removing the toxins from the liquid media. lgg and pjs removed four of the seven tested toxins (the removal varying from 18 to 93%) and  lc-705 two toxins (10-64%). of the toxins, 3-acdon was not removed by any of the  bacteria; ht-2 was removed by the non-viable lgg and also slightly by non-viable  lc-705; das was removed by all three bacteria tested. binding is postulated as the possible mechanism of the removal, since no difference was observed between the ability of viable and heat-killed bacteria in removing the trichothecenes, and no degradation products of the toxins were detected by gas chromatography (gc)-mass spectrometry (ms) analysis. it is concluded that significant differences exist in the ability of the bacteria to bind trichothecenes in vitro.

TI  == effects of orally administered viable lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  == immunomodulation by probiotics is a subject of growing interest, but the knowledge of dose response and time profile relationships is minimal. in this study we examined the effects of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii js (pjs) on the proliferative activity of murine lymphocytes ex vivo. dose dependency was assessed by treating  animals perorally with a low or a high dose (i.e., 10(9) or 10(12) viable bacteria/kg of body weight) for 7 days. the lower dose levels of each strain appeared to enhance t-cell proliferation at the optimal concanavalin a (cona) concentration (by 69 to 84%) and b-cell proliferation at the optimal and supraoptimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (by 57 to 82%). b-cell proliferation was also enhanced by the high lgg dose (by 32 to 39%) but was accompanied by a marginal decrease in t-cell proliferation (by 8%) at the optimal cona concentration. the time profiles of the immune responses were assessed after daily treatment with the higher dose for 3, 7, and 14 days. a significant decrease in basal lymphoproliferation (by 32 to 42%) was observed with pjs treatment after the 3- and 7-day periods; however, this activity returned to control levels after 14 days of treatment, which also resulted in significantly enhanced t-cell proliferation at optimal and supraoptimal cona concentrations (by 24 to 80%). the 14-day lgg treatment also enhanced the latter activity (by 119%). in conclusion, lgg and pjs have specific dose- and duration-dependent immunomodulatory effects on the proliferative activity of b and t lymphocytes and may also reduce lymphocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of lectin mitogens.
