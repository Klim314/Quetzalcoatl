TI  - Gene expression of enzymes involved in utilization of xylooligosaccharides by strains.
AB  - Prebiotics are defined as food components that confer health benefits on the host through modulation of the microbiota. Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) are non-digestible oligosaccharides that have recently received increasing attention as potential prebiotic candidates. XOS are sugar oligomers composed of 1,4-linked xylopyranosyl backbone and are obtained by either chemical or, more commonly, enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan polysaccharides, extracted from the plant cell wall. The bifidogenic effect of XOS was demonstrated by both in vitro studies and small-scale in vivo human studies. Some intestinal bacterial strains are able to grow on XOS, yet numerous studies have demonstrated that the ability to utilize these oligosaccharides varies considerably among these bacteria. The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of several strains Lactobacillus to use XOS. Fifteen Lactobacillus strains, allifiated to L. plantarum, L. brevis and L. sakei, were studied. Screening procedure was performed for the ability of the strains to utilize XOS as an alternative carbon source. Only some of them utilize XOS. The growth kinetics show the presence of two lag phases, indicating that these bacteria utilize probably some monosaccharides present in the used XOS. XOS were fermented with high specificity by Bifidobacteria strains, but Lactobacilli did not metabolize XOS efficiently.
TI  - Investigation of reduction and tolerance capability of lactic acid bacteria isolated from kimchi against nitrate and nitrite in fermented sausage condition.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis KGR3111, Lactobacillus curvatus KGR 2103, Lactobacillus plantarum KGR 5105, and Lactobacillus sakei KGR 4108 isolated from kimchi were investigated for their potential to be used as starter culture for fermented sausages with the capability to reduce and tolerate nitrate/nitrite. The reduction capability of tested strains for nitrate was not dramatic. All tested strains, however, showed the capability to produce nitrite reductase with the reduction amount of 58.46-75.80 mg/l of NO(2)(-). L. brevis and L. plantarum showed nitrate tolerance with the highest number of 8.71 log cfu/ml and 8.81 log cfu/ml, and L. brevis and L. sakei exhibited nitrite tolerance with the highest number of 8.24 log cfu/ml and 8.25 log cfu/ml, respectively. As a result, L. brevis, L. plantarum, and L. sakei isolated from kimchi showed a tolerance against nitrate or nitrite with a good nitrite reduction capability, indicating the satisfaction of one of the selection criteria to be used as starter culture for fermented sausages.
TI  - Detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 isolated from freshwater fish: Bacteriocin from Lb. brevis FPTLB3.
AB  - Lactobacillus brevis FPTLB3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 AU/ml) against Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Enterococcus faecalis MTCC 2729, Lactobacillus casei MTCC 1423, Lactobacillus sakei ATCC 15521 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees C for 60 min and declined thereafter. Stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at pH range of 2.0 to 8.0. Its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. Mitomycin C and UV light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. Exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except Nonidet P-40, which led to total loss of activity. No bacteriocin adsorption was detected at pH 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at pH 6.5. Based on Tricine SDS-PAGE the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kDa. No plasmid was found to present in the isolate.
TI  - Species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations.
AB  - Leek (Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum) is one of Belgium's most important vegetables. All or part of the green leek parts are often left on the fields because of their limited cooking applications compared to the white leek parts. Therefore, the possibility to perform leek fermentations in view of product valorization and diversification was investigated. This study deals with the community dynamics, species diversity, and metabolite kinetics of spontaneous leek fermentations, thereby studying the influence of added NaCl concentration, harvesting season, and duration of the fermentation. The combination of a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach revealed the prevalence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from the third day of fermentation onwards, which was not influenced by the fermentation conditions applied. Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and yeasts disappeared after one week of fermentation. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus sakei, and Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Lactobacillus parabrevis were the most frequently isolated LAB species. Both added NaCl concentrations were suitable to perform successful fermentations within three weeks. By that time, glucose and fructose, the main leek carbohydrates, were metabolized into mainly lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, and mannitol. A sensory analysis revealed that the fermented white leek parts were generally more appreciated than the fermented green leek parts.
TI  - Development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - To improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. Microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. A total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16S rRNA gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species, including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. After fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. The array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (Lactobacillus plantarum group, L. fermentum, L. brevis, L. delbrueckii, L. casei, L. sakei, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Listeria monocytogenes) except L. animalis. Multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. The feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with Thai fermented sausages (Nham). Meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, L. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and L. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. The naturally-fermented Nham contained L. sakei, L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum and L. fermentum. The L. plantarum-inoculated Nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for L. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. The L. brevis-inoculated Nham contained L. brevis, L. plantarum, L. delbrueckii and L. fermentum. The array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. The naturally-fermented and L. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of L. plantarum on day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. In contrast, the L. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and L. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. The bacteria identification array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.
TI  - Survival of silage lactic acid bacteria in the goat gastrointestinal tract as determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the survival rate of silage lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in the  ruminant gastrointestinal tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: Wilted Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage (containing 1.9 x 10(6) CFU LAB g(-1)) was fed ad libitum to three goats equipped with rumen cannulae. Silage was given alone or with concentrates at a 1 : 1 ratio on a dry matter basis. Rumen fluid was then obtained 2, 4 and 8 h after the morning feeding. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was performed to compare LAB communities in silage, rumen fluid and faeces. The LAB detected in the wilted silage included Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus murinus and Lactobacillus sakei. Bands indicative of Lact. murinus were detected in either the rumen fluid or faeces, whereas the bands indicative of Lact. plantarum, Lact. brevis and Lact. sakei were not. Although the rumen fluid LAB counts and volatile fatty acid concentrations were higher in goats fed silage plus concentrates compared with those fed silage alone, the LAB communities themselves remained unaffected. Sampling times and goat-to-goat variations did not affect the LAB communities found in the rumen fluid. CONCLUSION: LAB communities found in the gut are not remarkably affected by the consumption of silage LAB, even when the silage is accompanied by concentrates that facilitate gut fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Although silage can improve probiotic function, it may be difficult for silage LAB to survive the digestive process in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional pickles in Sichuan, China.
AB  - The pickle, a traditional fermented vegetable product, is popular in Sichuan Province of China. The objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of dominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in pickles by analyzing 36 samples collected from 6 different regions in Sichuan Province. The LAB counts in these samples varied from 3.90 to 8.40 log cfu ml(-1). In total, 185 presumptive LAB with Gram-positive and catalase-negative properties were obtained from these samples using MRS agar, and those strains were identified at the species level by physiological tests, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiplex PCR assay. The results revealed that all isolates were accurately identified as Enterococcus thailandicus (2 strains), Lactobacillus alimentarius (16 strains), L. brevis (24 strains), L. paracasei (9 strains), L. plantarum (81 strains), L. pentosus (38 strains), L. sakei (8 strains), L. spicheri (1 strain), Leuconostoc lactis (1 strain) and Pediococcus ethanolidurans (5 strains). The predominant LAB in Sichuan pickle was L. plantarum, which were isolated from most samples. The results also demonstrated that different regions in Sichuan Province have complex compositions of LAB species, and such a rich resource of LAB strains provides raw data for further studies involving probiotic strain selection.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Italian ryegrass silage.
AB  - Twenty-three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from three cultivars (Akiaoba, Nagahahikari and Tachiwase) of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) silage were precisely characterized by a combination of phenotypic tests, genotypic 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing and rapid PCR-based analyses, focusing on their useful phenotypes for silage preparation as inoculants. We successfully identified both at the species and subspecies levels: phenotypically novel Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis subsp. torquens, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei subsp. carnosus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum and Pediococcus parvulus. This is the first report to elucidate the presence of Lactobacillus coryniformis ssp. torquens and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum in Italian ryegrass silages. Physiological and biochemical tests revealed that phenotypic characteristics are different among the different strains of the same species and subspecies, and that the isolates show unique and diverse phenotypes related to fermentation factors, such as available carbohydrates, optimal growth pH and temperature. These results suggest that, for various well-preserved silage preparations, the isolates may be useful in producing novel inoculants corresponding to their optimally climatic and ecological niches.
TI  - Combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods for the determination of lactic microbiota in sucuk.
AB  - In this study, the culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods were used for the identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sucuk a Turkish fermented dry sausage. On the one hand, the PCR-DGGE method targetting the V1 and V3 regions of 16S DNA was applied to DNA that was directly extracted from sucuk samples. On the other hand, rep-PCR fingerprinting was performed for the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates, and the results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16S rDNA and 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer region. As a result of the PCR-DGGE analysis of all the samples, total 8 different lactic acid bacteria were identified, and Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus and Weissella viridescens were the dominant microbiota among these bacteria. The culture-dependent approach indicated that the majority of the strains belonged to the Lactobacillus genera including Lb. sakei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lb. curvatus, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus farciminis and Lactobacillus alimentarius. However, Leuconostoc and Weisella were also detected as minor genera. Again, Lactococcus piscium, Weissella halotolerans, Staphylococcus succinus and the comigrated Staphylococcus piscifermentans/Staphylococcus condimenti/Staphylococcus carnosus group were detected only with the culture-independent method while Lb. plantarum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum were identified only by using the culture-dependent method. In the results, it was concluded that the combination of culture-dependent and culture-independent methods was necessary for reliable and detailed investigation of LAB communities in fermented food products.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Growth characterization of individual rye sourdough bacteria by isothermal microcalorimetry.
AB  - AIMS: The present work tests the feasibility of the isothermal microcalorimetry method to study the performance of individual lactic acid bacteria during solid-state fermentation in rye sourdough. Another aim was to elucidate the key factors leading to the formation of different microbial consortia in laboratory and industrial sourdough during continuous backslopping propagation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Strains of the individual LAB isolated from industrial and laboratory sourdough cycle were grown in 10 kGy irradiated rye dough in vials of an isothermal calorimeter and the power-time curves were obtained. Sugars, organic acids and free amino acids in the sourdough were measured. The OD-time curves of the LAB strains during growth in flour extract or MRS (De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe) broth were also determined. The maximum specific growth rates of Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus curvatus and Leuconostoc citreum strains that dominated in backslopped laboratory sourdough were higher than those of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus panis, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus pontis strains originating from industrial sourdough. Industrial strains had higher specific growth rates below pH 4.8. It was supposed that during long-run industrial backslopping processes, the oxygen sensitive species start to dominate because of the O(2) protective effect of rye sourdough. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of the power-time curves revealed that the LAB strains dominating in the industrial sourdough cycle had better acid tolerance but lower maximum growth rate and oxygen tolerance than species isolated from a laboratory sourdough cycle. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Isothermal microcalorimetry combined with chemical analysis is a powerful method for characterization of sourdough fermentation process and determination of growth characteristics of individual bacteria in sourdough.
TI  - Diversity of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  - The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. Lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus vaginalis and Lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. These species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus parabuchneri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. Bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. Bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only Bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. Bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.
TI  - Distribution of aminogenic activity among potential autochthonous starter cultures for dry fermented sausages.
AB  - Any bacterial strain to be used as starter culture should have suitable characteristics, including a lack of amino acid decarboxylase activity. In this study, the decarboxylase activity of 76 bacterial strains, including lactic acid bacteria and gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci, was investigated. These strains were previously isolated from European traditional fermented sausages to develop autochthonous starter cultures. Of all the strains tested, 48% of the lactic acid bacteria strains and 13% of gram-positive, catalase-positive cocci decarboxylated one or more amino acids. Aminogenic potential was strain dependent, although some species had a higher proportion of aminogenic strains than did others. Thus, all Lactobacillus curvatus strains and 70% of Lactobacillus brevis strains had the capacity to produce tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine. Some strains also produced other aromatic amines, such as tryptamine and the diamines putrescine and cadaverine. All the enterococcal strains tested were decarboxylase positive, producing high amounts of tyramine and considerable amounts of beta-phenylethylamine. None of the staphylococcal strains had tyrosine-decarboxylase activity, but some produced other amines. From the aminogenic point of view, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, and Staphylococcus xylosus strains would be the most suitable for use as autochthonous starter cultures for traditional fermented sausages.
TI  - Genetic screening of wine-related enzymes in Lactobacillus species isolated from  South African wines.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of genes coding for enzymes of oenological relevance in wine Lactobacillus strains isolated from South African grape and wine samples during the 2001 and 2002 harvest seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 120 wine lactobacilli isolates belonging to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus paraplantarum were genetically screened for enzyme-encoding genes using PCR with primers specific for beta-glucosidase, protease, esterase, citrate lyase and phenolic acid decarboxylase. The results of PCR screening showed that the Lactobacillus strains possessed different combinations of enzymes and that some strains did not possess any of the enzymes tested. Confirmation analysis with gene sequencing also showed high similarity of genes with those available in GenBank database. CONCLUSION: In this study, we have demonstrated the existence of genes coding for wine-related enzymes in wine lactobacilli that could potentially hydrolyse wine precursors to positively influence wine aroma. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: An expansion of knowledge on the genetic diversity of wine-associated lactic acid bacteria will enable the selection of novel malolactic fermentation starter cultures with desired oenological traits for the improvement of the organoleptic quality of the wine, and hence wine aroma.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in French wheat sourdough as determined by molecular characterization using species-specific PCR.
AB  - The lactic acid microflora of nine traditional wheat sourdoughs from the Midi-Pyrenees area (South western France) was previously isolated and preliminary characterized using conventional morphological and biochemical analysis. However, such phenotypic methods alone are not always reliable and have a low taxonomic resolution for identification of lactic acid bacteria species. In the present study, a total of 290 LAB isolates were identified by PCR amplification using different sets of specific primers in order to provide a thorough characterization of the lactic flora from these traditional French sourdoughs. Overall, the LAB isolates belonged to 6 genera: Lactobacillus (39%, 8 species), Pediococcus (38%, 1 species), Leuconostoc (17%, 2 species), Weissella (4%, 2 species), Lactococcus (1%, 1 species) and Enterococcus (<1%, 1 species) and 15 different species were detected: L. plantarum, L. curvatus, L. paracasei, L. sanfranciscensis, L. pentosus, L. paraplantarum, L. sakei, L. brevis, P. pentosaceus, L. mesenteroides, L. citreum, W. cibaria, W. confusa, L. lactis and E. hirae. Facultative heterofermentative LAB represent more than 76% of the total isolates, the main species isolated herein correspond to L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. Obligate heterofermentative lactobacilli (L. sanfranciscencis, L. brevis) represent less than 3% of the total isolates whereas Leuconostoc and Weissella species represent 21% of the total isolates and have been detected in eight of the nine samples. Detection of some LAB species was preferentially observed depending on the isolation culture medium. The number of different species within a sourdough varies from 3 to 7 and original associations of hetero- and homofermentative LAB species have been revealed. Results from this study clearly confirm the diversity encountered in the microbial community of traditional sourdough and highlight the importance of LAB cocci in the sourdough ecosystem, along with lactobacilli.
TI  - Inhibition of uropathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated from dairy foods and  cow's intestine in western Nigeria.
AB  - A total of 96 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from African indigenous fermented products and cow's intestines to study their inhibitory capability against multi-drug-resistant uropathogens. Escherichia coli accounted for approximately 45% of isolated uropathogens, followed by Staphylococcus spp. (20%). The Gram negative uropathogens were highly resistant to quinolones, co-trimoxazole, teicoplanin and some beta-lactams, while the Staphylococcus spp. showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams and macrolides. Twenty-four LAB isolates were selected based on their antimicrobial activity against two uropathogenic Staphylococcus aureus strains and bacteriocin production. LAB strains showing antimicrobial activity were grouped into smaller groups through amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Representative strains were identified as Weissella spp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus brevis through sequencing of 16S rDNA. The Weissella spp. and L. brevis strains demonstrated remarkable inhibitory activity against seven strains of Gram negative uropathogens. Two strains of L. lactis produced a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance active against Lactobacillus sakei. In this study, an unusual high rate of co-trimoxazole, quinolones and macrolides resistance among uropathogens from south west Nigeria was discovered. Based on their sensitivity to Weissella spp., there is a potential for using these LAB as a natural approach for the protection against the uropathogens assayed.
TI  - Phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "Alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in Portugal.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from "Alheira", a fermented sausage produced in Portugal. LAB were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. Two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. Lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and Enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. Low numbers of Lactobacillus paraplantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus zeae, Lactobacillus paracasei, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Pediococcus acidilactici, Weissella cibaria, Weissella viridescens and Enterococcus faecium were recorded. The genetic heterogeneity of L. plantarum and E. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of DNA banding patterns obtained by RAPD-PCR. Strains of L. plantarum and E. faecalis were different from different producers. This study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "Alheira".
TI  - Biodegradation of chlorpyrifos by lactic acid bacteria during kimchi fermentation.
AB  - We examined the role of microorganisms in the degradation of the organophosphorus (OP) insecticide chlorpyrifos (CP) during kimchi fermentation. During the fermentation of kimchi, 30 mg L(-1) of CP was added and its stability assayed during fermentation. CP was degraded rapidly until day 3 (83.3%) and degraded completely by day 9. Four CP-degrading lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from kimchi fermentation in the presence of 200 mg L(-1) CP and were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides WCP907, Lactobacillus brevis WCP902, Lactobacillus plantarum WCP931, and Lactobacillus sakei WCP904. CP could be utilized by these four strains as the sole source of carbon and phosphorus. Coumaphos (CM), diazinon (DZ), parathion (PT), and methylparathion (MPT) were also degraded by WCP907, WCP902, WCP931, and WCP904 when provided as sole sources of carbon and phosphorus.
TI  - Molecular and technological characterization of lactic acid bacteria from traditional fermented sausages of Basilicata region (Southern Italy).
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from traditional fermented sausages of the Basilicata  region were investigated by ARDRA-PCR and RAPD-PCR for taxonomic identification at species and strain level and characterized on the basis of the growth and acidification at different temperatures, incubation times, levels of NaCl and KNO(2), hydrolysis of sarcoplasmatic and myofibrillar proteins and antimicrobial, peptide/amino acid release and nitrate reductase activities. Lactobacillus sakei was the predominant species (67%) followed by Pediococcus pentosaceus (16%), Leuconostoc carnosum (8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (4%), Lactobacillus brevis (2%) and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (2%). The technological characterization revealed that most of the isolates had good acidifying and proteolytic properties. Moreover, Lb. sakei strains showed antimicrobial ability, while Leuconostoc strains the highest reduction of nitrates. This work was a preliminary study in the formulation of autochthonous starter cultures in order to standardize the production process of sausages, to preserve their typical organoleptic and sensory characteristics and to improve the quality of final product.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Identification of potential probiotic starter cultures for Scandinavian-type fermented sausages.
AB  - Potential probiotic cultures suitable as starter cultures for the Scandinavian-type fermented sausages were identified among strains well-adapted to fermented meats as well as strains originating from a culture collection. From 15 different fermented meat products, 22 strains were isolated as dominant non-starter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB). The isolates were identified by RAPD, API and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and showed to be five strains of Lactobacillus sakei, five strains of Lactobacillus farciminis, five strains belonging to the group of Lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, four strains of Lactobacillus alimentarius, two strains of Lactobacillus brevis and one strain of Lactobacillus versmoldensis. Heterofermentative strains as well as strains not growing at 37 degrees C and not lowering pH below 5.1 in a meat model were excluded leaving 9 strains for further studies. These strains together with 19 strains from a culture collection were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to pH 2.5 or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. Strains that fulfilled all the probiotic criteria and showed to be fast acid producers in a meat model included three strains belonging to the group of Lb. plantarum/pentosus (MF1291, MF1298, MF1300) which originated from the dominant NSLAB of fermented meat products. MF1291 and MF 1298 were further identified as Lb. plantarum and MF1300 as Lb. pentosus. The three strains were all successfully applied as starter cultures for the production of fermented sausage. The viable count at the end of the processing period reached high cell numbers (4.7x10(7)-2.9x10(8) cfu/g) and pH of the sausages decreased to pH 4.8-4.9 without any flavour deviation compared to sausage fermented by a commercial meat starter culture.
TI  - Characterisation of lab in typical Salento Pecorino cheese.
AB  - Twenty-nine strains of Lactic Acid Bacteria isolated from the typical Pecorino cheese of the Salento area of Italy, were identified and grouped according to their genetic similarity. A preliminary characterisation of the strains was conducted by means of morphological and biochemical analysis, but molecular approaches were necessary for the clear identification of the species. For the species detection, the amplification and sequencing of the 16S rDNA gene was employed In addition, restriction analysis of amplified rDNA (ARDRA) and PCR and AFLP fingerprinting enabled inter- and intra-specific variation to be estimated UPGMA cluster analysis was used to divide the strains into distinct clusters which corresponded with the species delineation obtained by molecular identification. The data obtained show that the community of lactobacilli responsible for the fermentation and aging of Pecorino cheese is composed of a limited number of species. The main identified strains were Lactobacillus brevis, L. plantarum, L. casei, L. sakei, L. pentosus, L. farciminis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.
TI  - Arginine catabolism by sourdough lactic acid bacteria: purification and characterization of the arginine deiminase pathway enzymes from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1.
AB  - The cytoplasmic extracts of 70 strains of the most frequently isolated sourdough  lactic acid bacteria were screened initially for arginine deiminase (ADI), ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTC), and carbamate kinase (CK) activities, which comprise the ADI (or arginine dihydrolase) pathway. Only obligately heterofermentative strains such as Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis CB1; Lactobacillus brevis AM1, AM8, and 10A; Lactobacillus hilgardii 51B; and Lactobacillus fructivorans DD3 and DA106 showed all three enzyme activities. Lactobacillus plantarum B14 did not show CK activity. L. sanfranciscensis CB1 showed the highest activities, and the three enzymes were purified from this microorganism to homogeneity by several chromatographic steps. ADI, OTC, and CK had apparent molecular masses of ca. 46, 39, and 37 kDa, respectively, and the pIs were in the range of 5.07 to 5.2. The OTCs, CKs, and especially ADIs were well adapted to pH (acidic, pH 3.5 to 4.5) and temperature (30 to 37 degrees C) conditions which are usually found during sourdough fermentation. Internal peptide sequences of the three enzymes had the highest level of homology with ADI, OTC, and CK of Lactobacillus sakei. L. sanfranciscensis CB1 expressed the ADI pathway either on MAM broth containing 17 mM arginine or during sourdough fermentation with 1 to 43 mM added arginine. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that ADI, OTC, and CK were induced by factors of ca. 10, 4, and 2 in the whole-cell extract of cells grown in MAM broth containing 17 mM arginine compared to cells cultivated without arginine. Arginine catabolism in L. sanfranciscensis CB1 depended on the presence of a carbon source and arginine; glucose at up to ca. 54 mM did not exert an inhibitory effect, and the pH was not relevant for induction. The pH of sourdoughs fermented by L. sanfranciscensis CB1 was dependent on the amount of arginine added to the dough. A low supply of arginine (6 mM) during sourdough fermentation by L. sanfranciscensis CB1 enhanced cell growth, cell survival during storage at 7 degrees C, and tolerance to acid environmental stress and favored the production of ornithine, which is an important precursor of crust aroma compounds.
TI  - Development of a rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented italian sausages using a polymerase chain reaction-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - A rapid method for the identification of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from naturally fermented Italian sausages was developed. It is based on the amplification of a small fragment from the 16S rRNA gene followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE). Lactobacillus sakei, L. curvatus, L. alimentarius, L. casei, L. plantarum and L. brevis, obtained from International Collections, were used to optimize the method. Thiry-nine strains of Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from naturally fermented sausages and, after traditional identification, were tested by the PCR-TGGE protocol developed. No differences were observed comparing the results obtained, apart from five strains identified as L. curvatus that showed a PCR-TGGE profile identical to L. sakei.
