TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Relationship between periodontal pocket sulfide levels and subgingival species.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many species implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). This investigation examined the relationship between levels of sulfide and subgingival bacterial species in the same periodontal pockets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty chronic periodontitis subjects were measured clinically at six sites per tooth for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level. Subgingival plaque samples, taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth, were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Sulfide levels were measured at the same sites using a Diamond Probe/Perio 2000 system. Clinical and microbiological data were averaged for sulfide-positive and -negative sites separately in each subject and then averaged across subjects. Significance differences in clinical and microbial parameters between sulfide-positive and -negative sites were sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. RESULTS: Mean total DNA probe counts (x10(5), +/-SEM) at sulfide-negative and -positive sites were 44.0 +/- 9.9 and 65.0 +/- 13.3, respectively (p < 0.01). Seventeen species were found at significantly higher levels in sulfide-positive than -negative sites. These included abundant producers of VSC such as members of the genera Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Prevotella, Treponema and Eubacterium, and Bacteriodes forsythus, Selenomonas noxia and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella intermedia, Bacteriodes forsythus, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and Treponema denticola exhibited the greatest difference in mean counts between sulfide-negative and -positive sites. Orange and red complex species were at higher counts at shallow (< 4 mm) sulfide-positive than shallow sulfide-negative sites. Although not statistically significant, mean clinical parameters were somewhat higher at sulfide-positive than sulfide-negative sites. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-pocket sulfide levels reflect the levels of sulfide-producing species and may provide useful diagnostic information.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - Degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola.
AB  - Bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. In the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. The activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. Proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin III, antiplasmin and cystatin C) was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. The 80 kDa trypsin-like protease of P. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kDa chymotrypsin-like protease of T. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin C. When whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with P. gingivalis, T. denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Capnocytophaga spp. Peptostreptococcus micros and Propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus and Fusobacterium nucleatum, had no effect on the protease inhibitors. The 80 kDa protease of P. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kDa protease of T. denticola. This study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. This may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
