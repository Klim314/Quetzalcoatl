TI  == expression of a heterologous glutamate dehydrogenase gene in lactococcus lactis highly improves the conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds.
AB  == the first step of amino acid degradation in lactococci is a transamination, which requires an alpha-keto acid as the amino group acceptor. we have previously shown that the level of available alpha-keto acid in semihard cheese is the first limiting factor for conversion of amino acids to aroma compounds, since aroma formation is greatly enhanced by adding alpha-ketoglutarate to cheese curd. in this study we introduced a heterologous catabolic glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) gene into lactococcus lactis so that this organism could produce alpha-ketoglutarate from glutamate, which is present at high levels in cheese. then we evaluated the impact of gdh activity on amino acid conversion in in vitro tests and in a cheese model by using radiolabeled amino acids as tracers. the gdh-producing lactococcal strain degraded amino acids without added alpha-ketoglutarate to the same extent that the wild-type strain degraded amino acids with added alpha-ketoglutarate. interestingly, the gdh-producing lactococcal strain produced a higher proportion of carboxylic acids, which are major aroma compounds. our results demonstrated that a gdh-producing lactococcal  strain could be used instead of adding alpha-ketoglutarate to improve aroma development in cheese.

TI  == in vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  == it has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to  utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. the six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules a (amylose; sigma) and b (culture pro 958n). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. it was demonstrated that bifidobacterium spp., bacteroides spp., fusobacterium spp., and strains of eubacterium, clostridium, streptococcus, and propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only bifidobacterium spp. and clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. in fact, c. butyricum and bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on bifidobacterium and bacteroides cells and were extracellular for c. butyricum. active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on sds-page gels showed that the bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (m(r)) weights (>160,000),  medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). it was concluded that bifidobacterium spp. and c. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.

TI  == study of gene transfer in vitro and in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice from lactococcus lactis strains to various strains belonging to human intestinal  flora.
AB  == the use of genetically modified organisms (gmo) in dairy products requires evaluation of the dna transfer capacity from such organisms among the human intestinal microflora. thus, both in vitro and in vivo [in the digestive tract (dt) of mice] transfer from lactococcus lactis donor strains of the conjugative plasmid pil205 (cmr) and the non-conjugative plasmid pil253 (emr) to: (1) recipient strains isolated from human faecal flora bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. (strictly anaerobic bacterial strains) and enterococcus faecalis, (2) a whole human faecal flora, was studied.  in both cases, no gene transfer was observed to strictly anaerobic bacterial strains. dna transfer was only observed to the e. faecalis strain: in vivo cmr e. faecalis transconjugants were isolated from sequentially multi-associated mice and when the recipient strains associated with the mice, they were a defined mixture of bacteroides sp., bifidobacterium sp., peptostreptococcus sp. and e. faecalis strains. when mice were associated with the whole human faecal flora, the plasmid pil205 was transferred into some facultative anaerobic streptococci.  it was also shown that dna transfer occurred even when the lactococcal donor strain was transient in the dt of the gnotobiotic host animals.
