TI  == interleukin-6 and microrna profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  == background: atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. we aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (athsmcs) and healthy controls (hsmcs). findings: inactivated streptococcus mitis, s. sanguinis, s. gorgonii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in hsmcs and athsmcs. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. interleukin-6 (il-6) levels were  determined from cell culture supernatants and microrna expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. genome wide expression (gwe) analyses  were performed after 5 h stimulation. all studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory il-6 production in both smcs. the most powerful inducer of il-6 was  a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). of the 84 studied mirnas, expression of 9 mirnas differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between hsmcs and athsmcs stimulated  with inactivated bacteria or tnfalpha. the data was divided into two groups: high il-6 producers (a. actinomytectemcomititans and tnfalpha) and low il-6 producers  (streptococcal strains and p. gingivalis). the expression of 4 mirnas (mir-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy hsmcs and athsmcs in the low il-6 producer group. according to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in hsmcs and one athsmcs. conclusions: our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic smcs.

TI  == functional signatures of oral dysbiosis during periodontitis progression revealed by microbial metatranscriptome analysis.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a polymicrobial biofilm-induced inflammatory disease that affects 743 million people worldwide. the current model to explain periodontitis progression proposes that changes in the relative abundance of members of the oral microbiome lead to dysbiosis in the host-microbiome crosstalk and then to inflammation and bone loss. using combined metagenome/metatranscriptome analysis of the subgingival microbiome in progressing and non-progressing sites, we have characterized the distinct molecular signatures of periodontitis progression. methods: metatranscriptome analysis was conducted on samples from subgingival biofilms from progressing and  stable sites from periodontitis patients. community-wide expression profiles were obtained using next generation sequencing (illumina). sequences were aligned using 'bowtie2' against a constructed oral microbiome database. differential expression analysis was performed using the non-parametric algorithm implemented  on the r package 'noiseqbio'. we summarized global functional activities of the oral microbial community by set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology (go) orthology. results: gene ontology enrichment analysis showed an over-representation in the baseline of active sites of terms related to cell motility, lipid a and peptidoglycan biosynthesis, and transport of iron, potassium, and amino acids. periodontal pathogens (tannerella forsythia and porphyromonas gingivalis) upregulated different tonb-dependent receptors, peptidases, proteases, aerotolerance genes, iron transport genes, hemolysins, and crispr-associated genes. surprisingly, organisms that have not been usually associated with the disease (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and pseudomonas fluorenscens) were highly active transcribing putative virulence factors. we detected patterns of activities associated with progression of clinical traits. among those we found that the profiles of expression of cobalamin biosynthesis, proteolysis, and potassium transport were associated with the evolution towards disease. conclusions: we identified metabolic changes in the microbial community associated with the initial stages of dysbiosis. regardless of the overall composition of the community, certain metabolic signatures are consistent with disease progression. our results suggest that the  whole community, and not just a handful of oral pathogens, is responsible for an  increase in virulence that leads to progression. trial registration: nct01489839, 6 december 2011.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == action of essential oils from brazilian native and exotic medicinal species on oral biofilms.
AB  == background: essential oils (eo) obtained from twenty medicinal and aromatic plants were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis. methods: the antimicrobial activity of the eo was evaluates by microdilution method determining minimal inhibitory concentration. chemical analysis of the oils compounds was performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (cg-ms). the most active eo were also investigated as to their actions on the biolfilm formation. results: the most of  the essential oils (eo) presented moderate to strong antimicrobial activity against the oral pathogens (mic--minimal inhibitory concentrations values between 0.007 and 1.00 mg/ml). the essential oil from coriandrum sativum inhibited all oral species with mic values from 0.007 to 0.250 mg/ml, and mbc/mfc (minimal bactericidal/fungicidal concentrations) from 0.015 to 0.500 mg/ml. on the other hand the essential oil of c. articulatus inhibited 63.96% of s. sanguis biofilm formation. through scanning eletronic microscopy (sem) images no changes were observed in cell morphology, despite a decrease in biofilm formation and changes  on biofilm structure. chemical analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) of the c. sativum essential oil revealed major compounds derivatives from alcohols and aldehydes, while cyperus articulatus and aloysia gratissima (eos) presented mono and sesquiterpenes. conclusions: in conclusion, the crude oil from c. articulatus exhibited the best results of antimicrobial activity e ability to  control biofilm formation. the chemical analysis showed the presence of terpenes  and monoterpenes such as a-pinene, a-bulnesene and copaene. the reduction of biofilms formation was confirmed from sem images. the results of this research shows a great potential from the plants studied as new antimicrobial sources.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of punica granatum mesocarp, nelumbo nucifera leaf, psidium guajava leaf and coffea canephora extract on common oral pathogens: an in-vitro study.
AB  == background and objectives: alternative therapies are increasingly being explored  as extensive use of synthetic chemicals has led to the emergence of substantial side effects. phytomedicine has been well practiced as traditional medicine in various cultures for treatment of oral diseases. it has gained importance of late as an alternative to the conventional therapy. various plant and fruit extracts have been monitored recently to assess their potential against the common oral pathogens. aim of this study was to assess in-vitro efficacy of pomegranate peel, lotus leaf, guava leaf and coffee extracts on oral microorganisms. materials and  methods: concentrations of 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% were prepared for each, followed by efficacy testing using disc diffusion method against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and  candida albicans. results: all the four extracts were found to be effective against s.mutans and s.mitis, with maximum efficacy against s.mutans and s.mitis  displayed by pomegranate and lotus. antifungal efficacy was demonstrated by coffee and pomegranate. guava, lotus and coffee were effective against p.intermedia, while only coffee was found to be effective against p. gingivalis.  all the results were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). interpretation & conclusion: pomegranate, guava, lotus and coffee displayed significant anticariogenic effect while coffee was found to be most effective against periodontal pathogens as well as candida albicans. results revealed that  natural products may be used as economical and suitable adjuvant to synthetic medicines and compounds and their judicious use might not only help to inhibit the side effects of synthetic chemicals but also prove to be cost effective in developing economies.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis induces expression of transposases and cell death of streptococcus mitis in a biofilm model.
AB  == oral microbial communities are extremely complex biofilms with high numbers of bacterial species interacting with each other (and the host) to maintain homeostasis of the system. disturbance in the oral microbiome homeostasis can lead to either caries or periodontitis, two of the most common human diseases. periodontitis is a polymicrobial disease caused by the coordinated action of a complex microbial community, which results in inflammation of tissues that support the teeth. it is the most common cause of tooth loss among adults in the  united states, and recent studies have suggested that it may increase the risk for systemic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. in a recent series of papers, hajishengallis and coworkers proposed the idea of the "keystone-pathogen" where low-abundance microbial pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis) can orchestrate inflammatory disease by turning a benign microbial community into a dysbiotic one. the exact mechanisms by which these pathogens reorganize the healthy oral microbiome are still unknown. in the present manuscript, we present  results demonstrating that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis death and dna fragmentation in an in vitro biofilm system. moreover, we report here the induction of expression of multiple transposases in a streptococcus mitis biofilm when the periodontopathogen p. gingivalis is present. based on these results, we  hypothesize that p. gingivalis induces s. mitis cell death by an unknown mechanism, shaping the oral microbiome to its advantage.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == immunological and microbiological findings after the application of two periodontal surgical techniques: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to examine microbiological and immunological alterations following two periodontal surgical techniques, over a 6-month period. materials and methods: a  total of 30 chronic periodontitis patients participated in the present randomized controlled clinical trial and were randomized in two groups. modified widman flap (mwf) was applied in the control group and apically positioned flap (apf), without intervention to the bone, in the experimental group. gingival crevicular  fluid samples and subgingival plaque samples from the operated sites were collected at baseline, 6th, 12th and 24th post-operative week. results: no major  differences were noticed in immunological and microbiological profile of patients receiving either modified mwf or apf, for a period of 6 months. conclusions: the  choice of the periodontal surgical procedure does not seem to affect the immunological and the microbiological profile of patients with chronic periodontitis.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

TI  == cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. we hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. materials and methods: baseline  microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization (78 species). clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. results: nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, helicobacter pylori, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus anaerobius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii (p < .001). receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. socranskii, staph. aureus, staph. anaerobius, strep. intermedius, and strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. when adjusted for gender (not significant [ns]), smoking status (ns), older age (p = .003), periodontitis  history (p < .01), and t. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. conclusion: a cluster of bacteria including t. forsythia and staph. aureus are associated with  peri-implantitis.

TI  == antibacterial activity of myristica fragrans against oral pathogens.
AB  == myristica fragrans houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in penang island, malaysia. the ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus mitis atcc 6249, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419) and three gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522, porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586). antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.25 to  640 mg/ml and 0.075 to 40 mg/ml. the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was obtained by subculturing method. among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with mean mic value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml; p = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean mbc value ranging from 0.625 mg/ml to 20 +/- 0.00 (sd) mg/ml. while for seed and mace of myristica  fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. all of the  extracts of myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against  fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586. thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chinese medicine herbs against common bacteria in oral  biofilm. a pilot study.
AB  == twenty traditional chinese medicines (tcm) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four common oral bacteria. tcms were tested for sensitivity against streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis. aliquots of suspension of each bacterial species were inoculated onto a horse blood agar plate with tcms soaked separately on 6mm paper disks. the plates were incubated for 48h anaerobically and the mean diameters of  growth inhibition of three different areas obtained. 0.2% (w/v) chlorhexidine was used as a positive control. broth microdilution assay was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. fructus  armeniaca mume was effective against all four bacteria. thirteen tcms demonstrated antimicrobial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis, including cortex magnoliae officinalis, cortex phellodendri, flos caryophylli, flos lonicerae japonicae, fructus armeniaca mume, fructus forsythiae suspensae, herba  cum radice violae yedoensitis, herba menthae haplocalycis, pericarpium granati, radix et rhizoma rhei, radix gentianae, ramulus cinnamomi cassia and rhizoma cimicifugae. cortex phellodendri showed antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, while radix et rhizoma rhei was effective against streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis. fructus armeniaca mume had inhibitory effects against streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the effect of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine on the viability of some oral bacterial species. it also evaluated the ability of these bacteria to metabolize those substances. single-species biofilms of streptococcus gordonii, porphyromonas gingivalis, or fusobacterium nucleatum and dual-species biofilms of s. gordonii -- f. nucleatum and f. nucleatum -- p. gingivalis were grown on hydroxyapatite discs. seven species were studied as planktonic cells, including streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, and the species mentioned above. the viability of planktonic cells and biofilms was analyzed by susceptibility tests and time-kill assays, respectively, against different concentrations of nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine. high-performance liquid chromatography was performed to quantify nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations in the culture media after the assays. susceptibility tests and viability assays showed  that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine cannot reduce or stimulate bacterial growth. high-performance liquid chromatography results showed that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine concentrations were not altered after bacteria exposure. these findings indicate that nicotine, cotinine, and caffeine, in the concentrations used, cannot affect significantly the growth of these oral bacterial strains. moreover, these species do not seem to metabolize these substances.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == expression of the short fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == evaluation of co-aggregation among streptococcus mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == aims: to develop a semi-quantitative method for evaluating co-aggregation reactions among three bacterial species, and to examine the influence of fusobacterium nucleatum on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis. methods and results: the method involves coating hydroxyapatite (hap) discs with streptococcal cells and treatment with radio-labelled bacterial cell suspensions. the sensitivity of the method was estimated by comparison with a turbidometric co-aggregation assay. results from the two methods were in close agreement. streptococcus mitis-coated hap discs were immersed in a 3h-labelled fus. nucleatum cell suspension and then a 14c-labelled p. gingivalis cell suspension.  the discs were then pyrolysed to recover and quantify the released 3h and 14c radioactivity. the number of fus. nucleatum cells on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. conclusion: the data indicate that the method closely reflects co-aggregation characters, and that fus. nucleatum has a positive effect on the adherence of p. gingivalis. significance and impact of the study: the present method, which is designed to mimic the oral environment, should prove useful in the semi-quantitative evaluation of co-aggregation reactions.

AB  == a diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. the samples were cultured  for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), streptococcus mitis (66-65%), prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), eikenella corrodens (51-52%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella loescheii, campylobacter gracilis, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter concisus, peptostreptococcus micros and selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. the bacterial species streptococcus constellatus, peptostreptococcus micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, e. corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum  were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas streptococcus intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were associated with bleeding.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == pathogenicity of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  == the pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. a total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or streptococcus mitis. five strains of porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. the infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. none of the prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains in combination with a. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with s. mitis in 42-100%. no difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup i (p. intermedia) and serogroup ii and iii (p. nigrescens). the infectivity of p. intermedia or p. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. p. intermedia and p.  nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in  rabbits.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == cross-reactivity between human sialyl lewis(x) oligosaccharide and common causative oral bacteria of infective endocarditis.
AB  == the expression of sialy-lewis(x) (sle(x); neu5ac alpha 2-3 gal beta 1-4) (fuc alpha 1-3) glcnac-r) on oral bacteria producing infective endocarditis was determined by a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and an immunoelectron microscopy using the well-characterized anti-sle(x) monoclonal antibody snh-3 (mab snh-3; igm class). mab snh-3 reacted strongly with whole cells of oral bacteria: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus pyogenes, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens and porphyromonas gingivalis. the negatively stained immuno-electron micrograph of streptococcus pyogenes showed many reactive gold particles on the cell surface. our findings demonstrated the existence of immunologic mimicry between the sle(x) oligosaccharide and cell surface antigens of many species associated with infective endocarditis. we propose the hypothesis that if these bacteria escape their normal habitats, the surface components that mimic the sle(x) oligosaccharide might bind to host antigens of the selectin family which could promote binding to endothelial cells and, consequently, initiation of the events  leading to infective endocarditis.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == an analysis of the subgingival microflora in randomly selected subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to describe the presence of some microbial species in the subgingival microflora of a randomly selected subject sample. a further objective was to analyze the association between some microbiological characteristics and the periodontal conditions of the subjects. a total of 171 individuals aged 30-65 years were included. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the mesial aspect of the 6 ramfjord teeth by the use of the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analyzed according to standardized procedures. the periodontal condition of the subjects was examined clinically and included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and probing attachment level. the results showed that 81% of the subjects were positive for campylobacter rectus, 80% for fusobacterium nucleatum, 77% for streptococcus sanguis, 72% for streptococcus mitis, 66% for eikenella corrodens,  58% for prevotella intermedia, 32% for capnocytophaga, 27% for selenomonas, 25% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 14% for porphyromonas gingivalis and 13% for streptococcus mutans. small differences in the periodontal conditions were observed between subjects harboring p. gingivalis, a. actinomytecomitans or  > 5% p. intermedia and the rest of the sample. similarly small differences in the clinical parameters were revealed when the subjects were grouped according to proportions of disease-associated and health-associated species in their subgingival samples.

TI  == identification of proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria as activators of latent human neutrophil and fibroblast-type interstitial collagenases.
AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == characterization of the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis deposited on nitrocellulose paper was investigated. a variety of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of p. gingivalis bound to both s. sanguis and s. mitis. binding of p. gingivalis to all but one of the streptococci was not inhibited by salivary molecules. pretreatment of p. gingivalis with periodate and pretreatment of s. sanguis and s. mitis with pronase decreased binding, suggesting that adherence may be mediated by a protein on the streptococci interacting with a carbohydrate on p. gingivalis. binding was not inhibited by a selection of simple sugars. the ability to adhere to early plaque  bacteria such as s. sanguis and s. mitis may be important in the colonization of  the mouth by p. gingivalis.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.
