TI  == comparative analysis of pathogenic organisms in cockroaches from different community settings in edo state, nigeria.
AB  == cockroaches are abundant in nigeria and are seen to harbour an array of pathogens. environmental and sanitary conditions associated with demographic/socio-economic settings of an area could contribute to the prevalence of disease pathogens in cockroaches. a total of 246 cockroaches (periplaneta americana) in urban (benin, n=91), semi-urban (ekpoma, n=75) and rural (emuhi, n=70) settings in edo state, nigeria were collected within and around households. the external body surfaces and alimentary canal of these cockroaches were screened for bacterial, fungal, and parasitological infections. bacillus sp. and  escherichia coli were the most common bacteria in cockroaches. however, enterococcus faecalis could not be isolated in cockroaches trapped from ekpoma and emuhi. aspergillus niger was the most prevalent fungus in benin and ekpoma, while mucor sp. was predominant in emuhi. parasitological investigations revealed the preponderance of ascaris lumbricoides in benin and emuhi, while trichuris trichura was the most predominant in ekpoma. the prevalence and burden of infection in cockroaches is likely to be a reflection of the sanitary conditions  of these areas. also, cockroaches in these areas making incursions in homes may increase the risk of human infections with these disease agents.

TI  == spiromastixones a-o, antibacterial chlorodepsidones from a deep-sea-derived spiromastix sp. fungus.
AB  == fifteen new depsidone-based analogues named spiromastixones a-o (1-15) were isolated from the fermentation broth of a deep-sea spiromastix sp. fungus. their  structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive nmr and mass spectroscopic analysis in association with chemical conversion. spiromastixones a-o are classified into two subtypes based on the orientation of ring c relative to ring  a, while the n-propyl substituents on rings a and c are rarely seen in natural products. most analogues are substituted by various numbers of chlorine atoms. all compounds exhibited significant inhibition against gram-positive bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and bacillus subtilis with mic values ranging from 0.125 to 8.0 mug/ml. in addition, compounds 6-10 displayed potent inhibitory effects against methicillin-resistant bacterial strains of s. aureus (mrsa) and s. epidermidis (mrse), while 10 also inhibited the growth of the vancomycin-resistant bacteria enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium (vre). the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

TI  == the diversity and antimicrobial activity of preussia sp. endophytes isolated from australian dry rainforests.
AB  == limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of preussia within australia. this report describes endophytic preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (etoac) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of atcc type strains which included bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the opportunist yeast pathogen candida albicans. subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive etoac extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the clinical and laboratory standards institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. a total of 18 preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in genbank, suggesting  that they are new species. in preliminary screening, 13/18 preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against mrsa and c. albicans. these results highlight the  antimicrobial potential of australian preussia spp. and also the importance of australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.

TI  == bacterial contamination of unused, disposable non-sterile gloves on a hospital orthopaedic ward.
AB  == background: non-sterile disposable gloves are used on large hospital wards, however their potential role as a vehicle for pathogen transmission has not been  explored in this setting. aims: this study investigates glove use on a hospital orthopaedic ward to examine whether pathogen contamination occurs prior to contact with patients. method: glove samples were aseptically removed from boxes  on a hospital orthopaedic ward on opening and days 3, 6 and 9 thereafter. following elution of bacteria and viable counts, glove isolates were identified by standard techniques and 16s rdna sequencing. methicillin resistance of staphylococci was determined by disc diffusion, epsilon tests and pcr. gloves were inoculated to determine two isolate survival rates. results: total bacterial counts ranged from 0 to 9.6 x 10(3) cfu/glove. environmental bacteria, particularly bacillus species, were present on 31/38 (81.6%) of samples. half (19/38) the samples were contaminated with skin commensals; coagulase negative staphylococci were predominant. enterococcus faecalis , klebsiella pneumoniae , pseudomonas sp. or methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus were recovered from 5/38 (13.2%) of samples. significantly more skin commensals and pathogens were recovered from samples from days 3, 6, 9 than box-opening samples. staphylococcus epidermidis and klebsiella pneumoniae inoculated onto gloves remained viable for several days but counts decreased. conclusion: health care workers introduced skin commensals and pathogenic bacteria into glove boxes indicating that unused, non-sterile gloves are potential pathogen transmission vehicles in hospitals. findings highlight adherence to handwashing guidelines, common glove retrieval practice, and glove-box design as targets for decreasing bacteria transmission via gloves on hospital wards.

TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == association with soil bacteria enhances p38-dependent infection resistance in caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == the importance of our inner microbial communities for proper immune responses against invading pathogens is now well accepted, but the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. in this study, we used caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. since very little is known about the microbes interacting with c. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the c. elegans microbiota. we established  a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil. bacterial members of the adult c. elegans microbiota were isolated by culture and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing. using pure cultures of bacterial isolates as food, we identified two, bacillus megaterium and pseudomonas mendocina, that enhanced resistance to a subsequent infection with the gram-negative pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas protection by b.  megaterium was linked to impaired egg laying, corresponding to a known trade-off  between fecundity and resistance, the mechanism underlying protection conferred by p. mendocina depended on weak induction of immune genes regulated by the p38 mapk pathway. disruption of the p38 ortholog, pmk-1, abolished protection. p. mendocina enhanced resistance to p. aeruginosa but not to the gram-positive pathogen enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, protection from p. aeruginosa was similarly induced by a p. aeruginosa gaca mutant with attenuated virulence but not by a different c. elegans-associated pseudomonas sp. isolate. our results support a pivotal role for the conserved p38 pathway in microbiota-initiated immune protection and suggest that similarity between microbiota members and pathogens may play a role in such protection.

TI  == detection of bacterial contamination in prestorage culture-negative apheresis platelets on day of issue with the pan genera detection test.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination is currently the most important infectious risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt) products. prestorage culture has reduced but not eliminated this problem. study design and methods: eighteen hospitals studied the pan genera detection (pgd) test, a rapid, lateral-flow immunoassay for the detection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the pgd test was performed on day of issue on apheresis plts released by collection centers as culture negative. confirmatory bacterial culture was performed when pgd tests were repeatedly reactive, with three sites performing culture on all doses studied. results: pgd tests on nine of 27,620 (1:3069, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1:6711 to 1:1617; or 326 per million, 95% ci 149-618 per million) apheresis plt doses were repeatedly reactive and verified as bacterially contaminated by confirmatory culture. bacterial species isolated included coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 6), bacillus sp. (n = 2), and enterococcus  faecalis (n = 1). the ages of these contaminated doses were day 3 (n = 4), day 4  (n = 2), and day 5 (n = 3). two contaminated doses with nonreactive pgd tests were detected among 10,424 doses at hospitals where concurrent culture was performed, and one other was identified via a transfusion reaction investigation. there were 142 pgd false positives (0.51%). conclusions: the pgd test detected bacterial contamination in 1:3069 (9 of 27,620) doses released as negative by prestorage culture in plts as young as 3 days old. three contaminated doses, two  clinically insignificant, had nonreactive pgd tests, while 0.51% of tests were false positives. application of this test on day of issue can interdict contaminated units and prevent transfusion reactions.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == defensin of the zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha): molecular structure, in vitro expression, antimicrobial activity, and potential functions.
AB  == a 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (est) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (dreissena polymorpha) foot cdna library developed in our laboratory. the d. polymorpha defensin (dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. the mature dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin a domain. homologue searching against genbank database suggested that this dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin a. the recombinant dpd was in vitro expressed through an escherichia coli expression system. the antimicrobial activities of the refolded recombinant dpd were found against the growth of morganella sp., plesiomonas shigelloides, edwardsiella tarda, e. coli and staphylococcus aureus aureus (atcc12598) with the minimal inhibition concentration (mic) 0.35, 0.43, 1.16, 6.46, and 30.39 microm, respectively. however, with less than 50 microm no detectable inhibition activities were observed against the other four gram-negative bacteria (aeromonas salmonicida salmonicida, motile aeromonas, flavobacterium sp., pseudomonas fluorescens, shewanella putrifaciens), as well as the other gram-positive bacteria (bacillus megaterium atcc14581, carnobacterium maltaromaticum atcc27865, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and micrococcus leteus atcc4698), and the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the rna fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) of dpd in the zebra  mussel suggested that the dpd was expressed in a variety of tissues, such as foot, retractor muscle, ctenidium, mantle, hemocytes, gonad, digestive gland, and intestine. by using the quantitative pcr, the expression level of dpd in the zebra mussel foot was the highest, followed by the muscle. by comparing the amount of dpd transcripts in the zebra mussel foot under two different byssogenesis conditions (byssogenesis and non-byssogenesis) with qpcr, we found that the higher expression levels of dpd were always associated with the byssogenesis status from 2 to 4 days after the start of byssogenesis. findings of this study suggest that the expression of the dpd gene was upregulated in vivo by byssogeneis, and by hemocytes in vitro upon stimulation with microbial antigens.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == efficacy of enterocin as-48 against bacilli in ready-to-eat vegetable soups and purees.
AB  == the broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin as-48 was tested for biopreservation of  ready-to-eat vegetable foods (soups and purees) against aerobic mesophilic endospore-forming bacteria. by adding as-48 (10 microg/ml), bacillus cereus lwl1  was completely inhibited in all six vegetable products tested (natural vegetable  cream, asparagus cream, traditional soup, homemade-style traditional soup, vegetable soup, and vichyssoise) for up to 30 days at 6, 15, and 22 degrees c. a  collection of strains isolated from spoiled purees showed slightly higher resistance to as-48 in the order paenibacillus sp. > bacillus macroides > b. cereus, although they were also completely inhibited in natural vegetable cream by as-48 at 10 microg/ml. however, cocktails of five or eight strains composed of b. cereus (three strains), b. macroides (two strains), and paenibacillus sp., paenibacillus polymyxa, and paenibacillus amylolyticus showed higher bacteriocin  resistance with as-48 of up to 50 microg/ml required for complete inactivation in natural vegetable cream stored at 22 degrees c. repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) analysis showed that paenibacilli (along with some b. cereus) was the predominant survivor in the cocktails after bacteriocin treatment. to increase the effectiveness of enterocin as-48, the bacteriocin was  tested (at 20 microg/ml) against the eight-strain cocktail in natural vegetable cream in combination with other antimicrobials. the combination of as-48 and nisin had a slight but significant additive effect. bactericidal activity was greatly enhanced by phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and hydrocinnamic acid), achieving a rapid and complete inactivation of bacilli in the tested puree at 22 degrees c.

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

TI  == characterization of the microbial flora in disinfecting footbaths with hypochlorite.
AB  == change or disinfection of footwear are measures to prevent cross contamination between areas with low and high hygienic levels in the food industry. the efficacy of disinfecting footwear is not well documented. samples of used disinfectant and from swabbing of corners after draining were taken from disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine in four norwegian cheese factories. bacteria were present in 9 of 12 footbaths and more positive samples were found from swab samples than from used disinfectant. the microbial flora in footbaths varied between the dairies. in two dairies, the flora was dominated by pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp., respectively. in the third dairy, both bacillus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were present and in the fourth dairy, the flora was diverse (acinetobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus sp.). the strains were not resistant to the recommended  user concentration of chlorine in bactericidal suspension or surface tests. the degree of attachment to plastic varied between strains and species and bacteria attached to surfaces were in general more resistant than suspended bacteria. the  results of the survey indicated that disinfecting footbaths containing chlorine may act as contamination sources in food factories and should not be used without regular hygienic monitoring.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sativa, m. arborea and m. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. activity was especially high against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b.  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) with m. arabica being  the species showing a broader spectrum of action. discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against saccharomyces cerevisiae. the observed antimicrobial properties of m. sativa and m. arborea were related to the content  of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of  m. arabica total sapogenins.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of arctium lappa constituents against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections.
AB  == this study evaluated in vitro the antimicrobial activity of rough extracts from leaves of arctium lappa and their phases. the following microorganisms, commonly  found in the oral cavity, specifically in endodontic infections, were used: enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the agar-diffusion method allowed detection of the hexanic phase as an inhibitor of microbial growth. bioautographic assays identified antimicrobial substances in the extract. the results showed the existence, in the rough hexanic phase and in its fractions, of constituents that  have retention factors (rf) in three distinct zones, thereby suggesting the presence of active constituents with chemical structures of different polarities  that exhibited specificity against the target microorganisms. it may be concluded that the arctium lappa constituents exhibited a great microbial inhibition potential against the tested endodontic pathogens.

TI  == bacteria isolated from the different developmental stages and larval organs of the obligate parasitic fly, wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae).
AB  == wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae) is the major myiasis-causing fly species in the whole of eurasia for most important domestic animals. the aim of the present work was to obtain data on the culturable bacteria isolated under aerobic conditions from this fly: bacteria were isolated from all developmental stages (larvae, pupa, and imago) of wohlfahrtia magnifica, and the third-stage larval organs were also sampled. to determine the possible antagonistic effects between the dominant bacterial groups, an antibiosis assay was carried out. plating and isolation of bacteria was performed by classical microbiological methods. characterization of the isolated strains was carried out via a polyphasic approach; classical phenotypic tests, chemotaxonomical examinations, and 16s rdna sequence analyses were also applied. in the case of maggot macerate  samples, members of the family enterobacteriaceae were characteristic. members of a new genus (schineria) belonging to the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria were also isolated. according to our data, the shifts in the schineria and proteus populations within the larvae are strongly influenced by their interactions with  each other and among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the pupa and imago samples contained several other gram-negative bacteria (stenotrophomonas, brevundimonas, etc.). among gram-positive bacteria, in all maggot macerate samples, members of the genus bacillus and the arthrobacter-micrococcus group of  actinobacteria were dominant (neither of them was a producer or sensitive to the  compounds of other microorganisms), and bacteria related to the genus corynebacterium were also found. from the larvae aureobacterium liquefaciens and  enterococcus faecalis were isolated, and from the pupae dietzia maris and enterococcus faecalis. in the samples of third-stage larval organs, the dominant  groups were the same as in the third-stage larval macerate sample; however, several additional genera/species were observed (rhodococcus fascians, streptomyces sp., rathayibacter sp., bacillus thuringiensis/cereus).

TI  == biochemical characterization of bacillus subtilis type ii isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase, and phylogenetic distribution of isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways.
AB  == an open reading frame (acc. no. p50740) on the bacillus subtilis chromosome extending from bp 184,997-186,043 with similarity to the idi-2 gene of streptomyces sp. cl190 specifying type ii isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase was expressed in a recombinant escherichia coli strain. the recombinant protein with  a subunit mass of 39 kda was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography. the protein was shown to catalyse the conversion of dimethylallyl diphosphate into isopentenyl diphosphate and vice versa at rates of 0.23 and 0.63 micromol.mg(-1).min(-1), respectively, as diagnosed by 1h spectroscopy. fmn and divalent cations are required for catalytic activity; the highest rates were found with ca2+. nadph is required under aerobic but not under anaerobic assay conditions. the enzyme is related to a widespread family of (s)-alpha-hydroxyacid oxidizing enzymes including flavocytochrome b2 and l-lactate dehydrogenase and was shown to catalyse the formation of [2,3-13c2]lactate from [2,3-13c2]pyruvate, albeit at a low rate of 1 nmol.mg(-1).min(-1). putative genes specifying type ii  isopentenyl diphosphate isomerases were found in the genomes of archaea and of certain eubacteria but not in the genomes of fungi, animals and plants. the analysis of the occurrence of idi-1 and idi-2 genes in conjunction with the mevalonate and nonmevalonate pathway in 283 completed and unfinished prokaryotic  genomes revealed 10 different classes. type ii isomerase is essential in some important human pathogens including staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis where it may represent a novel target for anti-infective therapy.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == plasmid and chromosomal basis of tolerance to cadmium and resistance to antibiotics in normal bovine duodenal bacterial flora.
AB  == cadmium (cd) tolerance and antibiotic resistance was studied in duodenal flora of 20 normal bovine samples. twelve bacterial isolates (5 staphylococcus spp, 4 enterococcus faecalis, 2 bacillus spp, and a pseudomonas sp) were grown in luria  broth containing 0.05 to 0.8 mm of cadmium chloride (cdcl). all isolates displayed multiple antibiotic resistance, with 2 enterococcus strains and pseudomonas pickettii demonstrating resistance to 12/17 antibiotics tested. with  the exception of staphylococcus sp, all contained plasmid dna. curing to remove plasmid dna determined if cd tolerance and/or antibiotic resistance was plasmid or chromosomally mediated. none of the bacteria became sensitive to cdcl after curing, suggesting that tolerance was not plasmid-mediated. six bacteria became sensitive to antibiotics after curing indicating that antibiotic2 resistance was  plasmid mediated. two of these bacteria became sensitive to multiple antibiotics; a staphylococcus sp became sensitive to ampicillin, ceftiofur and cephalothin, and a enterococcus strain became sensitive to neomycin, oxacillin, and tiamulin.  all of the isolates were probed for the presence of known cd-resistance genes (cada, cadc, and cadd). dna-dna hybridization revealed cada- and cadc-related sequences in chromosomal dna of a staphylococcus sp, an enterococcus strain, and  in plasmid dna of another staphylococcus sp. no cadd-related sequences were detected in any of the 12 isolates even under reduced stringency of hybridization.

TI  == conjugative mobilization of the rolling-circle plasmid pip823 from listeria monocytogenes bm4293 among gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == we determined the sequence and genetic organization of plasmid pip823, which contains the dfrd gene; dfrd confers high-level trimethoprim resistance to listeria monocytogenes bm4293 by synthesis of dihydrofolate reductase type s2. pip823 possessed all the features of the pub110/pc194 plasmid family, whose members replicate by the rolling-circle mechanism. the rep gene encoded a protein identical to repu, the protein required for initiation of the replication of plasmids ptb913 from a thermophilic bacillus sp. and pub110 from staphylococcus aureus. the mob gene encoded a protein with a high degree of amino acid identity  with the mob proteins involved in conjugative mobilization and interplasmidic recombination of ptb913 and pub110. the host range of pip823 was broad and included l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, s. aureus, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli. in all these species, pip823 replicated by generating single-stranded dna and was stable. conjugative mobilization of pip823 was obtained by self-transferable plasmids between l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis,  between l. monocytogenes and e. coli, and between strains of e. coli, and by the  streptococcal conjugative transposon tn1545 from l. monocytogenes to e. faecalis, and from l. monocytogenes and e. faecalis to e. coli. these data indicate that the gene flux observed in nature from gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria can occur by conjugative mobilization. our results suggest that dissemination of trimethoprim resistance in listeria spp. and acquisition of other antibiotic resistance determinants in this species can be anticipated.

TI  == role of resistance to starvation in bacterial survival in sewage and lake water.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the significance of starvation resistance to the ability of a species to survive in sewage and lake water. tests were conducted for periods of up to 14 days. rhizobium meliloti and one fluorescent and one nonfluorescent strain of pseudomonas were resistant to starvation because their population sizes did not fall appreciably in buffer and sterile lake water, and the first two maintained high numbers after being added to sterile sewage. cell densities of these bacterial species dropped slowly in nonsterile sewage, and more cells of these three organisms than of the other test organisms remained in nonsterile lake water. rhizobium leguminosarum was moderately resistant to starvation because its numbers fell slowly in buffer and sterile lake water and did not change appreciably in sterile sewage. the abundance of micrococcus flavus added to buffer and sterile lake water did not change, but the density of m. flavus declined in nonsterile lake water. the abundance of r. leguminosarum fell  in nonsterile lake water and nonsterile sewage. streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, an asporogenous strain of bacillus subtilis, and streptococcus sp. were susceptible to starvation because their populations were markedly reduced in buffer. populations of the last three species declined rapidly in nonsterile and sterile samples of lake water and sewage. s. faecalis declined rapidly when added to nonsterile lake water and sewage and sterile lake  water but not when added to sterile sewage, the persistence in the last instance  probably being associated with the availability of organic nutrients.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == an efficient and simplified method for hand-rearing of caesarean-derived infant rabbits under gnotobiotic condition was devised. the caesarean-derived infant dutch or japanese-white rabbits and their hybrids (f1; japanese-white female x dutch male) were reared in sterilized vinyl-isolators by hand-feeding with two kinds of milk diets, a and b, consisted mainly ofa commercial milk powder for dogs and cats (esbilac) supplemented with several minor components (table 2) and  administered intragastrically once a day through a nelaton's catheter. bacteriological examinations revealed that feces and urine were sterile for the first three days. on the third day, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus, and bacteroides sp. were given with milk diet and the infant rabbits were reared until 10 to 12 weeks of age. the weaning rate at 5 weeks of age and the raising rate at 3 months of age were approximately 78% and 77%, respectively (table 3), indicating that feeding once-a-day with a milk diet mainly composed of esbilac is suitable for the hand-rearing of infant rabbits. there was, however, no significant difference milk diet a and b on the weaning rate.
