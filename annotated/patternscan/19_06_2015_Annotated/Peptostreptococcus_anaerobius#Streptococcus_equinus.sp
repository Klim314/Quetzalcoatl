TI  == effects of adding polyclonal antibody preparations on ruminal fermentation patterns and digestibility of cows fed different energy sources.
AB  == nine ruminally cannulated cows fed different energy sources were used to evaluate an avian-derived polyclonal antibody preparation (pap-mv) against the specific ruminal bacteria streptococcus bovis, fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium aminophilum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium sticklandii and monensin (mon) on ruminal fermentation patterns and in vivo digestibility. the experimental design was three 3 x 3 latin squares distinguished by the main energy source in the diet [dry-ground corn grain (cg), high-moisture corn silage  (hmcs), or citrus pulp (cipu)]. inside each latin square, animals received one of the feed additives per period [none (con), mon, or pap-mv]. dry matter intake and ruminal fermentation variables such as ph, total short-chain fatty acids (tscfa), which included acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as well as lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration were analyzed in this trial. total tract dm apparent digestibility and its fractions were estimated using chromic oxide as an external marker. each experimental period lasted 21 d. ruminal fluid sampling was carried  out on the last day of the period at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after the morning meal. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.006) 4 h postfeeding in mon and pap-mv groups when compared with con. acetate:propionate ratio was greater in pap-mv compared with mon across sampling times. polyclonal antibodies did not alter (p > 0.05) tscfa, molar proportion of acetate and butyrate, or lactic acid and nh(3)-n concentration. ruminal ph was higher (p = 0.01), 4 h postfeeding in cipu diets compared with cg and hmcs. there was no interaction between feed additive and energy source (p > 0.05) for any of the digestibility coefficients analyzed. starch digestibility was less (p = 0.008) in pap-mv when compared with con and mon. in relation to energy sources, ndf digestibility was greater (p = 0.007) in  cg and cipu vs. the hmcs diet. the digestibility of adf was greater (p = 0.002) in cipu diets followed by cg and hmcs. feeding pap-mv or monensin altered ruminal fermentation patterns and digestive function in cows; however, those changes were independent of the main energy source of the diet.

TI  == the ability of non-bacteriocin producing streptococcus bovis strains to bind and  transfer bovicin hc5 to other sensitive bacteria.
AB  == streptococcus bovis hc5 produces a broad spectrum lantibiotic (bovicin hc5), but  s. bovis jb1 does not have antimicrobial activity. preliminary experiments revealed an anomaly. when s. bovis jb1 cells were washed in stationary phase s. bovis hc5 cell-free culture supernatant, the s. bovis jb1 cells were subsequently able to inhibit hyper-ammonia producing ruminal bacteria (clostridium sticklandii, clostridium aminophilum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius). other non-bacteriocin producing s. bovis strains also had the ability to bind and transfer semi-purified bovicin hc5. bovicin hc5 that was bound to s. bovis jb1 was much more resistant to pronase e than cell-free bovicin hc5, but it could be  inactivated if the incubation period was 24 h. acidic nacl treatment (100 mm, ph  2.0) liberates half of the bovicin hc5 from s. bovis hc5, but it did not prevent  bovicin hc5 from binding to s. bovis jb1. acidic nacl liberated some bovicin hc5  from s. bovis jb1, but the decrease in activity was only 2-fold. bovicin hc5 is a positively charged peptide, and the ability of s. bovis jb1 to bind bovicin hc5 could be inhibited by either calcium or magnesium (100 mm). acidic nacl-treated s. bovis jb1 cells were unable to accumulate potassium, but they were still able  to bind bovicin hc5 and prevent potassium accumulation by untreated s. bovis jb1  cells. based on these results, bovicin hc5 bound to s. bovis jb1 cells still acts as a pore-forming lantibiotic.

TI  == the use of pcr for the identification and characterisation of bacteriocin genes from bacterial strains isolated from rumen or caecal contents of cattle and sheep.
AB  == pcr primers were designed to amplify the gene that encodes bovicin 255 from streptococcus gallolyticus lrc0255 and the bacteriocin genes from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains ar10 and or79a (bvid and bvi79a) in order to screen for their incidence in rumen and caecal b. fibrisolvens and streptococcus bovis-like  isolates from new zealand and north american ruminants. none of the b. fibrisolvens-like strains (n=34) isolated from new zealand or north america had the genes encoding for butyrivibriocins ar10 (bvid) or or79 (bvi79a). however, seven s. bovis isolates from new zealand ruminants and three from north american  animals had the bovicin 255 gene. sequence comparison of cloned bovicin 255 pcr products indicated a 92.9-95.7% similarity to that of the corresponding bovicin 255 gene sequence of s. gallolyticus. four of the new zealand bovicin 255 positive s. bovis isolates were from the caecal contents of the same sheep and had identical pfge profiles. two other s. bovis isolates sharing the same pfge profile were isolated from a separate animal from the same flock. pfge analysis of the north american strains indicated that all three were closely related as two of three had identical pfge profiles with the remaining isolate differing only by a single band position. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the 10 isolates were at least 99.8% identical to s. bovis. all 10 s. bovis isolates having the gene for bovicin 255 produced bacteriocin activity that inhibited the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius d1 in a deferred antagonism plating (dap) assay. certain s. bovis isolates obtained from ruminants have bacteriocin activity associated with a distinct bovicin 255 gene sequence but it appears that bacteriocin production by the rumen anaerobe b. fibrisolvens may be uncommon in strains isolated from cattle and sheep in new zealand.

TI  == circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  == root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, actinomyces bovis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides oralis in various combinations. after 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. in 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (ha), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of b. oralis in all five monkeys. agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of b. oralis in titers between  1:40 and 1:320. a marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of igm-class. the study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
