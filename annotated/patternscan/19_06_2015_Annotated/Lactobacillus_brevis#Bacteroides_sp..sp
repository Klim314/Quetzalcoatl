TI  == distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  == the gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. a colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides vulgatus, enterobacter aerogenes, and a fusobacterium sp. was established. these gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. except for the presence of large numbers of bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of s. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism  in conventional gerbils. microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic  gerbils were similar. histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
