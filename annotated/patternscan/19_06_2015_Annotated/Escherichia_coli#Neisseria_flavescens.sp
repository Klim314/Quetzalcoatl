TI  == a novel neisserial shuttle plasmid: a useful new tool for meningococcal research.
AB  == we report the identification and nucleotide sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pmidg2830 from the gram-negative bacterium neisseria flavescens. the largest open reading frame encodes a protein similar to the replication protein,  repa, found in pab49 from acinetobacter baumannii and pni10 from pseudomonas. modified by the incorporation of a kanamycin resistance cassette, the plasmid can be stably maintained in escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis, and can be used as a shuttle plasmid in meningococcal research.

TI  == functional diversity of three different dsba proteins from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the genome of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of dsba, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the dsb protein family. dsba assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in  diverse organisms. while all three cloned genes complemented the dtt sensitivity  of dsba-null escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. nmb0278 protein was the most active  in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while nmb0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic malf. nmb0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. it is extremely unusual for organisms to contain  more than one chromosomal dsba. among the members of the genus neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea and neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while neisseria flava, neisseria subflava and neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. it is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced  potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == construction of recombinant neisserial hsp60 proteins and mapping of antigenic domains.
AB  == here we report the cloning and expression, in escherichia coli, of pcr-amplified  dna encoding the 63-kda stress-inducible protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae strains vp1 and pid2, neisseria meningitidis 2996 and the commensal neisseria flavescens. dna sequence analysis revealed in all cases one open reading frame of 541-544 amino acids corresponding to a protein of approximately 57,000 da. the various neisserial proteins were > 96% identical at the amino acid level and showed extensive homology with proteins belonging to the hsp60 heat-shock-protein family. we constructed defined glutathione s-transferase fusion polypeptides of the gonococcal hsp60 homologue to locate antigenic domains on the recombinant protein. variation in the immunoreactivity of two monoclonal antibodies recognizing a conserved and a neisseria-unique antigenic hsp60 determinant, respectively, could thus be deduced to result from single amino acid substitutions. analysis of the antibody response in patients' sera demonstrated reactivity with the same fusion polypeptides in six out of nine sera, indicating  that neisserial hsp60 is expressed during the natural infection and that distinct domains on the protein are immunodominant in vivo.

TI  == dihydrofolate reductase from neisseria sp.
AB  == members of the genus neisseria are relatively nonsusceptible to trimethoprim, an  inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase. for example, the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of trimethoprim for n. gonorrhoeae ranges from 2 to 70 mug/ml, whereas the mic for escherichia coli is 0.2 mug/ml or less. in an effort  to understand this difference, dihydrofolate reductase was partially purified from five neisseria species and compared with the enzyme from e. coli. n. gonorrhoeae dihydrofolate reductase was similar to that from e. coli in molecular weight (18,000) and affinity for the substrates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and dihydrofolate (k(m) = 13 and 8 mum, respectively). however, the gonococcal enzyme had a decreased affinity for trimethoprim, with an apparent k(i) of 45 x 10(-9) m, some 30-fold greater than the e. coli value of 1.2 x 10(-9) m. these enzymes also differed in their isoelectric points and ph activity profiles. within the genus neisseria, the dihydrofolate reductase isolated from n. meningitidis and n. lactamica resembled the n. gonorrhoeae enzyme, and only small differences were detected for the n. flavescens and branhamella catarrhalis dihydrofolate reductases. these data indicate that the relatively poor affinity of trimethoprim for the dihydrofolate reductase from these organisms may be largely responsible for the relative nonsusceptibility of  neisseria sp. to trimethoprim. the contribution of other resistance mechanisms to the overall nonsusceptibility was assessed. strains of n. gonorrhoeae with altered cell envelope permeability had mic values less than twofold different from those of isogenic wild-type strains. also, a direct relationship was observed between the affinity of trimethoprim analogs for gonococcal dihydrofolate reductase and the mic of these compounds for the gonococcus. these  observations suggest that the cell envelope of n. gonorrhoeae is not impermeable  to trimethoprim. changes in the amount of dihydrofolate reductase activity could  cause alterations in the susceptibility of the gonococcus to trimethoprim, as demonstrated with n. gonorrhoeae strains selected for trimethoprim resistance after chemical mutagenesis. however, the level of dihydrofolate reductase activity in wild-type n. gonorrhoeae was similar to that of e. coli, indicating that the difference in the susceptibility of these organisms is not due to greater amounts of enzyme in n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus neisseria.
AB  == eleven aerobic species of neisseria, a mima sp., and a herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology in direct hybridization experiments. dna labeled with either (14)c or (32)p was prepared from five species of neisseria. unlabeled dna from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled dna (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 c. the measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous dna. all serological types of n. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of n. meningitidis with one possible exception, type z. the genus neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae; second, n. perflava, n. subflava, n. sicca, n. flavescens, and n. flava; third, n. catarrhalis and n. caviae. mima and herellea species show no significant homology with the neisseria.
