TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer sequences for analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus porphyromonas.
AB  == the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) regions of 11 reference strains of porphyromonas species, together with bacteroides distasonis and tannerella forsythensis, were analysed to examine interspecies relationships. compared with the phylogenetic tree generated using 16s rrna gene sequences, the  resolution of the its sequence-based tree was higher, but species positioning and clustering were similar with both approaches. the recent separation of porphyromonas gulae and porphyromonas gingivalis into distinct species was confirmed by the its data. in addition, analysis of the its sequences of 24 clinical isolates of porphyromonas asaccharolytica plus the type strain atcc 25260(t) divided the sequences into two clusters, of which one was alpha-fucosidase-positive (like the type strain) while the other was alpha-fucosidase-negative. the latter resembled the previously studied unusual extra-oral isolates of 'porphyromonas endodontalis-like organisms' (pelos) which  could therefore be called 'porphyromonas asaccharolytica-like organisms' (palos), based on the genetic identification. moreover, the proposal of alpha-fucosidase-negative p. asaccharolytica strains as a new species should also be considered.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and beta-lactamase production of clinical isolates of prevotella and porphyromonas species.
AB  == background: this study determined the beta-lactamase production and the antimicrobial resistance of 72 prevotella species and 48 porphyromonas species isolated from different clinical specimens. methods: all strains were identified  using api 32 id. the beta-lactamase production was determined by nitrocefin disks. e test strips of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were tested for each strain. results: nineteen prevotella melaninogenica, 18 prevotella intermedia, 16 prevotella denticola, 11 prevotella loescheii and 8 prevotella bivia strains were identified. four were clindamycin resistant. the highest beta-lactamase production was found at a rate of 68.4% in p. melaninogenica species. additionally, 33 porphyromonas asaccharolytica and 15 porphyromonas gingivalis strains were identified. none of them produced beta-lactamase. conclusion: in view of the emerging antibiotic resistance among anaerobes, the current local susceptibility profile of our prevotella and porphyromonas species will establish the basis for additional surveys tracing significant changes in the antimicrobial resistance of our clinical isolates.

TI  == whole genomic dna probe for detection of porphyromonas endodontalis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to develop a dna probe for porphyromonas endodontalis. pure cultures of p. endodontalis were grown in typ medium, in an anaerobic chamber. dna was extracted from the p. endodontalis and labeled using the genius system by boehringer mannheim. the labeled p. endodontalis dna was used in dot-blot hybridization reactions with homologous (p. endodontalis) and unrelated bacterial samples. to determine specificity, strains of 40 other oral bacterial species (e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica,  and prevotella intermedia) were spotted and reacted with the p. endodontalis dna  probe. none of the panel of 40 oral bacteria hybridized with the p. endodontalis  probe, whereas the blot of the homologous organism showed a strong positive reaction. to determine the sensitivity of the probe, dilutions of a p. endodontalis suspension of known concentration were blotted onto a nylon membrane and reacted with the probe. the results of our investigation indicate that the dna probe that we have prepared specifically detects only p. endodontalis and can detect at least 3 x 10(4) cells.

TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == phospholipid analogues of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas has lipids containing hydroxy acids and c16:0 and iso-c15:0 major monocarboxylic acids among others. nothing is known of its individual phospholipid molecular species. the aim of this study was to determine molecular  weights and putative identities of individual phospholipid molecular species extracted from porphyromonas gingivalis (seven strains), p. asaccharolytica (one  strain) and p. endodontalis (two strains). cultures on blood-fastidious anaerobe  agar were harvested, washed and freeze-dried. phospholipids were extracted and separated by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (fab ms) in negative-ion mode. phospholipid classes were also separated by thin layer chromatography (tlc). the major anions in the range m/z 209-299 were consistent with the presence of the c13: 0, c15: 0, c16: 0 and c18: 3 mono-carboxylate anions. major  polar lipid anion peaks in the range m/z 618-961 were consistent with the presence of molecular species of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and with unidentified lipid analogues. porphyromonas gingivalis differed from comparison strains of other species by having major anions with m/z 932, 946 and  960. unusually, a feline strain of p. gingivalis had a major peak of m/z 736. selected anions were studied by tandem fab ms which revealed that peaks with m/z  653 and 946 did not correspond to commonly occurring classes of polar lipids. they were however, glycerophosphates. it is concluded that the polar lipid analogue profiles obtained with porphyromonas are quite different from those of the genera prevotella and bacteroides but reveal heterogeneity within p. gingivalis.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == construction of a plasmid vector for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == a host-vector system for transformation of porphyromonas gingivalis was constructed using a set (1) strains that can incorporate plasmid dna by electroporation regardless of its source and (2) stable vector plasmids with a selectable marker. first, restriction-negative mutants were isolated, because p.  gingivalis possesses restriction modification systems by which dna introduced by  transformation even from heterologous strains of the same species is excluded. for screening of the mutants, plasmid pe5-2 was employed since it could be transconjugated (mobilized) to p. gingivalis from escherichia coli and is able to replicate in this species, albeit not stably. pe5-2 dna prepared from e coli was  introduced by electroporation into chemically mutagenized p. gingivalis cells. by this method, three putative restriction-negative clones were selected. these strains exhibited a capacity for electroporation with plasmid dnas both from e. coli and from various p. gingivalis strains at a similar efficiency. using one of the derivatives thus obtained, yh522, we then screened for plasmids that could replicate stably in p. gingivalis. since no plasmids were found from p. gingivalis, cryptic plasmids from other species of black-pigmented oral anaerobic rods were examined for their ability to transform p. gingivalis. a series of plasmids constructed by ligation with pbr322 for replication in e. coli and the ecori-b fragment from pbf4 containing erythromycin resistance were prepared from  e. coli and were used for electroporation of p. gingivalis. among these, a recombinant plasmid containing the replicon of pyhba1 from porphyromonas asaccharolytica, designated pyh400, was found to be incorporated into the restriction-negative p. gingivalis strain and replicated stably. this set of recipient strains and stable plasmids with a selectable marker constitutes the first practical host-vector system for this species.

TI  == possible lethal enhancement of toxins from putative periodontopathogens by nicotine: implications for periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: to test the hypothesis that lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and bacterial products (cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates) of five putative periodontopathogens. methods: the lethality of cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates of five periodontal species was assessed with or without nicotine in the chick embryo assay system. ten putative  periodontopathogens (five species) were studied: prevotella intermedia (n = 5), porphyromonas gingivalis (n = 1), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (n = 1), fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 2), and fusobacterium necrophorum (n = 1). results:  simultaneous testing of cell-free extracellular toxins from isolates w50, ps2, ps3, ps4, and ps5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (fisher's exact test). simultaneous testing of cell lysates from isolates w50, ps2, and ps5 and nicotine resulted in a percentage kill significantly greater than expected (fisher's exact test). conclusions: lethal synergy in the chick embryo model may occur between nicotine and toxins from putative periodontopathogens (both cell-free extracellular toxins and cell lysates). this may be an important mechanism by which smoking increases the severity of periodontal disease.

TI  == update on the taxonomy and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods.
AB  == pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods are currently categorized as 17 species distributed in three genera: prevotella, porphyromonas, and bacteroides. these organisms are often encountered in clinical specimens but are also found as part  of the indigenous flora on various mucosal surfaces. several studies are presently assessing the association of individual species with health and disease. for example, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas endodontalis are key putative pathogens in adult periodontitis and root canal infections, respectively. porphyromonas asaccharolytica is prevalent in extraoral infections. the porphyromonas species of animal origin have been isolated from infected bite  wounds in humans. isolates closely resembling bacteroides levii have been recovered from various types of human infections. according to preliminary reports, prevotella intermedia tends to be associated more often with periodontal disease than with a healthy oral cavity. in the laboratory, enzyme profiling facilitates the identification of these pigmented rods. beta-lactamase production is more common among prevotella species (30%-50%) than among porphyromonas species (< 10%).

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == congo red binding by porphyromonas gingivalis is mediated by a 66 kda outer-membrane protein.
AB  == congo red was bound from solution by strains of porphyromonas gingivalis including w50, hg189, hg184, nctc 11834, bg 381, wph35, the slower brown pigmenting colonial variant w50/br1, and the avirulent mutant w50/be1, and by porphyromonas endodontalis hg370 and porphyromonas asaccharolytica b537. sds-page of whole cells of all species examined displayed a 66 kda congo-red-binding component which was also detected in the outer membranes of p. gingivalis w50 grown in the chemostat under both haemin limitation and haemin excess, and which  corresponded to a coomassie-blue-stained band of the same mobility. pretreatment  of haemin-excess batch-grown cells of p. gingivalis w50 with polymyxin b, which binds to lipid a, did not inhibit binding, whilst binding was enhanced in the presence of 2 m ammonium sulphate, suggesting the involvement of non-specific hydrophobic interactions. binding was also reduced by pretreatment with trypsin and papain, and by 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulphonic acid, which binds to hydrophobic amino acids. the 66 kda binding component was sensitive to proteinase k digestion, and loss of congo red staining of this band correlated with the quantitative reduction in congo red binding by whole cells. these data, and our previous work, show that congo red and iron protoporphyrin ix (haemin) are bound  to different outer-membrane components, and that congo red binding may be of little value as a marker to detect virulent strains of p. gingivalis or those expressing haemin-binding proteins.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the naha gene from porphyromonas gingivalis indicates that beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase is an outer-membrane-associated lipoprotein.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated in human periodontal diseases. it expresses a number of exoglycosidase enzymes capable of hydrolysing host proteoglycan residues. as a first stage to explore the role of these enzymes in periodontal tissue damage, the naha gene of p. gingivalis w83, which encodes beta-n-acetylhexosaminidase (beta-nahase), was cloned. the gene was expressed poorly in escherichia coli, but increased expression was achieved by cloning the  naha gene downstream of the tac promoter. southern blot analysis revealed that naha was present as a single copy, and it was found in all the other p. gingivalis strains tested. in contrast, sequences homologous to naha were not detected in either p. endodontalis or p. asaccharolytica. the naha gene was 2331  bp long and encoded a beta-nahase enzyme of 777 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 87 kda. a characteristic signal peptide for an acylated lipoprotein was present at the amino-terminus, suggesting that the mature beta-nahase is a lipoprotein. the predicted amino acid sequence of the p. gingivalis beta-nahase shared homology with the catalytic domains of the human beta-nahase enzyme and the chitinase of vibrio harveyi, suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.

TI  == degradation of immunoglobulin g by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == several subgingival microorganisms were tested for their ability to utilize human immunoglobulin g (igg) as a substrate for growth. this was done using a protein-free chemically defined medium, supplemented with igg. stimulation of growth was observed for capnocytophaga ochracea, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella oralis, lactobacillus catenaforme and streptococcus intermedius. immunoelectrophoresis, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and a protein assay demonstrated that p. intermedia and p. endodontalis completely degraded the protein chains of igg. partial breakdown of igg was observed for p. asaccharolytica and c. ochracea, whereas p. oralis cleaved the igg heavy chain, yielding fc and fab fragments. all these bacteria utilized igg as a substrate for growth. binding studies using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, revealed complete loss of in vitro antigen-antibody binding capacity after incubation of specific igg with p. endodontalis and partial loss of binding with  p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, c. ochracea or fusobacterium nucleatum. degradation or inactivation of igg by oral bacteria is thought to be important in the causation of polymicrobial infections.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivicanis sp. nov. and porphyromonas crevioricanis sp. nov., isolated from beagles.
AB  == two new species, porphyromonas gingivicanis and porphyromonas crevioricanis, are  proposed for black-pigmented, asaccharolytic, anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organisms. these organisms were isolated from the gingival crevicular fluids of beagles. p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis do not grow in the presence of 20% bile. they exhibit less than 5%  dna-dna homology with the type strains of porphyromonas gingivalis (strain atcc 33277), porphyromonas endodontalis (strain atcc 35406), and porphyromonas asaccharolytica (strain atcc 25260), which were isolated from humans, or with the type strains of porphyromonas salivosa (strain nctc 11632) and porphyromonas circumdentaria (strain nctc 12469), which were isolated from cats. the major cellular fatty acid of p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0 acid). glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present in both species, and 6-phosphogluconate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenases are absent; neither organism exhibits trypsin activity. p. gingivicanis and p. crevioricanis produce large amounts of acetic and isovaleric  acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and succinic acids as end products of metabolism in gam medium. p. gingivicanis also produces large amounts of butyric  acid and small amounts of propionic acid, while p. crevioricanis produces large amounts of propionic acid and minor amounts of butyric and phenylacetic acids. the g+c contents of the dna of p. gingivicanis is 41 to 42 mol%; the g+c content  of the dna of p. crevioricanis is 44 to 45 mol%. catalase is produced by p. gingivicanis but not by p. crevioricanis; strains of p. crevioricanis agglutinate sheep erythrocytes, but strains of p. gingivicanis do not.(abstract truncated at  250 words)

AB  == oligonucleotide probes complementary to the hypervariable regions of the 16s rrna of porphyromonas gingivalis, and previously shown to specifically identify human  p. gingivalis strains to the species level, were tested for their ability to recognize p. gingivalis from nonhuman primates (macaca fascicularis), either as distinct isolates or in subgingival dental plaque. the 32p-labeled probes hybridized with all 147 monkey isolates identified as p. gingivalis by morphology and biochemistry, but did not hybridize with any of the 331 isolates representing 17 genera of bacteria unrelated to p. gingivalis, or to the more closely related  p. endodontalis and p. asaccharolytica. this corresponds to sensitivities and specificities of 100%. of 76 m. fascicularis plaque samples, p. gingivalis was detected by probe and culture in 67. of 26 human plaque samples taken from separate individuals free of periodontal disease, 23 failed to demonstrate p. gingivalis by probe or culture. the results of the combined 102 monkey and human  plaque samples indicate that, when compared to culture as the "gold standard," the p. gingivalis probe had a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 87%, and an overall agreement with culture of 93%. these results reveal that the oligonucleotide probes used to identify p. gingivalis are specific for this organism, and give results comparable to culture methods for detecting the presence of p. gingivalis in m. fascicularis dental plaque.

TI  == porphyromonas canoris sp. nov., an asaccharolytic, black-pigmented species from the gingival sulcus of dogs.
AB  == a new species, porphyromonas canoris, is proposed for black-pigmented asaccharolytic strains isolated from subgingival plaque samples from dogs with naturally occurring periodontal disease. this bacterium is an obligately anaerobic, nonmotile, non-spore-forming, gram-negative, rod-shaped organism. on laked rabbit blood or sheep blood agar plates, colonies are light brown to greenish brown after 2 to 4 days of incubation and dark brown after 14 days of incubation. colonies on egg yolk agar and on nonhemolyzed sheep blood agar are orange. the cells do not grow in the presence of 20% bile and have a guanine-plus-cytosine content of 49 to 51 mol%. the type strain is vpb 4878 (= nctc 12835). the average levels of dna-dna hybridization between p. canoris strains and other members of the genus porphyromonas are as follows: porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277t (t = type strain), 6.5%; porphyromonas gingivalis cat strain vpb 3492, 5%; porphyromonas endodontalis atcc 35406t, 1%; porphyromonas salivosa nctc 11362t, 5%; and porphyromonas circumdentaria nctc 12469t, 6%. the level of hybridization between p. canoris nctc 12835t dna and porphyromonas asaccharolytica atcc 25260t dna is 3%. p. canoris cells produce major amounts of acetic, propionic, isovaleric, and succinic acids and minor amounts of isobutyric and butyric acids as end products of metabolism in cooked meat medium. the major cellular fatty acid is 13-methyltetradecanoic acid (iso-c15:0). glutamate and malate dehydrogenases are present, as are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (65.7 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1) and  6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase activity (63.0 nmol mg of protein-1 min-1).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == hydrolytic enzymes and lectin-binding activity of black-pigmented anaerobic rods.
AB  == recent taxonomic studies on black-pigmented anaerobic rods, a group of bacteria found on mucosal surfaces of humans and animals, led to the subdivision of existing species and to the creation of new species. the aim of this study was to characterize all 11 currently recognized species of black-pigmented bacteria (55  strains) for their ability to hydrolyse a variety of natural and synthetic substrates and for their lectin reactivity. although most of the strains demonstrated some activity against proteinaceous substrates, porphyromonas gingivalis was the only species able to hydrolyse type i collagen. most strains possessed glycylprolyl protease activity, elastase-like activity and phospholipase c activity, whereas trypsin-like activity was restricted to p. gingivalis, porphyromonas salivosa and bacteroides macacae. beta-lactamase activity was demonstrated in five strains belonging to the saccharolytic group. the lectin reactivity of the bacteria was determined by a dot-blot procedure using horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated lectins. three lectins, lotus a, rca-i and cona, failed to react with any of the bacteria tested. wga reacted strongly with the cell surface of human biotypes of asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteria (p. gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis) and prevotella intermedia. the animal biotype strains of p. gingivalis showed a higher affinity for sba and pna than for wga.

TI  == phylogeny of bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. and related bacteria.
AB  == the phylogenetic structure of the bacteroides subgroup of the cytophaga-flavobacter-bacteroides (cfb) phylum was examined by 16s rrna sequence  comparative analysis. approximately 95% of the 16s rrna sequence was determined for 36 representative strains of species of prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas and related species by a modified sanger sequencing method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a corrected distance matrix by the neighbor-joining method, and the reliability of tree branching was established by bootstrap analysis. the bacteroides subgroup was divided primarily into three major phylogenetic clusters which contained most of the species examined. the first cluster, termed the prevotella cluster, was composed of 16 species of prevotella, including p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and the ruminal species p. ruminicola. two oral species, p. zoogleoformans and p. heparinolytica, which had been recently placed in the genus prevotella, did not fall within the prevotella cluster. these two species and six species of bacteroides, including the type species b. fragilis, formed the second cluster, termed the bacteroides cluster. the third cluster, termed the porphyromonas cluster, was divided into two subclusters. the first contained porphyromonas gingivalis, p. endodontalis, p. asaccharolytica, p. circumdentaria, p. salivosa,  [bacteroides] levii (the brackets around genus are used to indicate that the species does not belong to the genus by the sensu stricto definition), and [bacteroides] macacae, and the second subcluster contained [bacteroides] forsythus and [bacteroides] distasonis. [bacteroides] splanchnicus fell just outside the three major clusters but still belonged within the bacteroides subgroup. with few exceptions, the 16 s rrna data were in overall agreement with  previously proposed reclassifications of species of bacteroides, prevotella, and  porphyromonas. suggestions are made to accommodate those species which do not fit previous reclassification schemes.

TI  == classification of black-pigmented anaerobes by pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms)  and conventional tests (cts).
AB  == clinical (66: dental 53; vaginal 4; wound 9) and reference (5*) strains of pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were examined in pyrolysis mass spectrometry (pms) and conventional tests (cts). the strains were identified in cts as: prevotella intermedia (48*); pr. melaninogenica (1); pr. corporis (7); porphyromonas asaccharolytica (12*); p. endodontalis (1*) and p. gingivalis (2*). numerical classification based on cts resolved five clusters comprising strains identified as (i) pr. corporis, (ii) pr. melaninogenica, (iii) pr. intermedia, (iv) p. gingivalis and (v) p. asaccharolytica and p. endodontalis. numerical classification based on pms showed a similar division, with decreasing homogeneity in the order pr. intermedia, pr. corporis, p. asaccharolytica, in agreement with the ordering of homogeneity for these species in cts. pms clusters corresponding the porphyromonas spp. were clearly distinct from those of prevotella spp. pms and ct classifications disagreed on cluster membership for only six of the strains. pms identification from blind challenge sets agreed with conventional identification for 64 of 67 strains.

TI  == occurrence of plasmids in black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are causative agents of pyogenic infections and are closely linked to various forms of periodontal diseases. whereas many studies have shown a high incidence of plasmids in intestinal bacteroides spp., there have been only a few reports of plasmid analyses in pigmented gram-negative anaerobes. according to previous reports and confirmed in this study, plasmids can be present in porphyromonas asaccharolytica, prevotella  intermedia, pr. melaninogenica, and b. levii but have not been detected in p. gingivalis or other black-pigmented species. there were no correlations between plasmids and phenotypes such as resistance to antibiotics or bacteriocinogenicity. the highest carriage rate was found in isolates from cases  of chronic otitis media, but the relationship between this site of infection and  a high incidence of plasmids could be incidental. the size of plasmids ranged from 1.5 to 29 mda. plasmids with molecular weight > 10 mda were described for the first time in these organisms. repeated plasmid analyses showed that the plasmid patterns were generally stable.

TI  == beta-lactamase production and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == beta-lactamase production by 98 porphyromonas strains was investigated by the nitrocefin (chromogenic cephalosporin) test. human isolates of p. gingivalis (91), p. endodontalis (2), and p. asaccharolytica (1) were tested, with four closely related porphyromonas spp. of animal origin and four reference strains. the in vitro susceptibility of 64 p. gingivalis strains was investigated on brucella blood agar by the e test. none of the human porphyromonas isolates tested produced beta-lactamase, but one porphyromonas strain of animal origin, most closely resembling p. endodontalis, produced beta-lactamase. p. gingivalis was susceptible to almost all of the drugs tested: benzylpenicillin, ampicillin,  cefaclor, cefuroxime, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole and ciprofloxacin; all strains were inhibited at 0.016 microgram/ml, 0.023 microgram/ml, 0.315 microgram/ml, 0.064 microgram/ml, 0.19 microgram/ml, 0.016 microgram/ml, 0.094 microgram/ml, 0.047 microgram/ml, 0.023 microgram/ml, and 0.75 microgram/ml of these drugs, respectively. cotrimoxazole exhibited variable efficacy against p. gingivalis; the range of mics was 0.1095-32.0 micrograms/ml. the results indicate that beta-lactamase production is currently not a problem amongst clinical isolates of p. gingivalis and strains are susceptible to most antimicrobial agents.

TI  == effects of root planing on the distribution of microorganisms adult periodontitis sites.
AB  == the aims of this study were to identify the microbial species present in subgingival plaque in patients with adult periodontitis, and to investigate the effects of root planing upon the microbial flora for 12 months following root planing. microorganisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in 15 patients were cultured, both aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas asaccharolytica were the most frequently identified species before  treatment. bacteroides ureolyticus, the prevotella veroralis/buccalis complex and other microorganisms including capnocytophaga ochracea, species of streptococci,  staphylococci and diphtheroids were also frequently isolated. root planing improved periodontal health, and was accompanied by reductions in the frequencies with which p. intermedia, p. asaccharolytica, the p. veroralis/buccalis complex and c. ochracea were isolated. regular scaling and oral hygiene reviews maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the study.

TI  == susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis and p. asaccharolytica to the non-oxidative killing mechanisms of human neutrophils.
AB  == neutrophils are essential for host defence against bacterial dental plaque and the pathogenic bacterial species within it, but in anaerobic environments such as the gingival crevice neutrophils can kill bacteria only with non-oxidative microbicidal compounds stored in their granules. porphyromonas gingivalis w83, a  pathogenic plaque species, and the avirulent non-oral type-strain p. asaccharolytica were incubated anaerobically with intact neutrophils and with compounds extracted from normal human neutrophil granules. the killing of bacteria and the inactivation of lysozyme, cathepsin g, elastase, bacterial-permeability increasing factor and defensins by culture supernatants were assayed. p. asaccharolytica but not p. gingivalis was killed under anaerobic conditions by intact neutrophils. p. gingivalis was also resistant to neutrophil  granule compounds, its viability being reduced from a mean of 3.3 x 10(6) to 6.1  x 10(4) c.f.u/ml in 60 min by 400 micrograms/ml neutrophil granule extract, as compared to a reduction from 4.4 x 10(6) to 2.3 x 10(3) c.f.u/ml for p. asaccharolytica. p. gingivalis culture supernatant inactivated cathepsin g, elastase, bacterial-permeability increasing factor and defensins. resistance to neutrophil non-oxidative killing mechanisms may be an important virulence factor  for p. gingivalis.

TI  == further studies on some physical and biochemical characteristics of asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides of feline origin.
AB  == the ultrastructure of the appendages of 24 strains of asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides spp. of cats was studied by transmission electron microscopy. all strains examined by thin section showed abundant fimbriae, outer membrane vesicles and capsules. negative staining showed fimbriae which varied from long,  fine and wavy in bact. salivosus and cat group 2 to shorter, less abundant and thicker fimbriae in cat strains of bact. gingivalis as well as type strains of porphyromonas gingivalis and p. asaccharolytica. capsular material was very thick amorphous in human p. gingivalis, cat strains of bact. gingivalis and in p. assaccharolytica but fine and fibrillary in preparations of bact. salivosus and cat group 2 organisms. wet india ink preparations showed a large capsule although those of bact. salivosus and group 2 appeared largest. five-day group 2 broth cultures featured a thick ropy growth consistent with a large accumulation of extracellular slime. enzymatic activities of the 24 strains measured by api zym system as well as the conventional biochemical tests showed it was possible to differentiate reliably bact. salivosus from the other cat strains of asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides species and from human p. gingivalis and p.  endodontalis by a combination of these tests. these tests suggest that bact. salivosus is unlikely to belong to the genus prevotella. its place within the genus porphyromonas is still to be determined.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7  gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. for comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against prevotella oralis, prevotella buccalis, prevotella bivia, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, bacteroides corporis, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium necrophorum, fusobacterium naviforme and propionibacterium acnes. prevotella oris, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and prevotella denticola, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides pneumosintes, and peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. strains of veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus magnus showed mics of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. the results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == rapid presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by using 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives.
AB  == a rapid method for presumptive identification of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods was developed. using filter paper spot tests for indole production, sialidase, alpha-glucosidase, beta-glucosidase, alpha-fucosidase, and trypsinlike enzyme activities, 100% of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides levii and 89% of prevotella corporis isolates were correctly identified to the species level. porphyromonas asaccharolytica and porphyromonas endodontalis could not be differentiated from each other but could  be distinguished from all other species tested. similarly, prevotella denticola,  prevotella loescheii, and prevotella melaninogenica could not be differentiated from each other. the methods described are based on 4-methylumbelliferone derivatives of the various substrates and are simple to perform, rapid (less than 15 min), and applicable to difficult-to-cultivate anaerobic rods.

TI  == sialidase (neuraminidase) activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic  bacteria.
AB  == a filter paper spot test with 2'-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid as a substrate was used to study the prevalence of sialidase activity among gram-negative anaerobic and capnophilic bacteria. a total of 567 isolates representing four genera of obligate anaerobes and four genera of capnophilic organisms was tested. sialidase activity was detected in 94% of 66 isolates from the bacteroides fragilis group,  98% of 66 b. bivius isolates, and all isolates of the following species (number of isolates follows species name): b. capillosus, 4; b. levii, 2; b. denticola, 22; b. loescheii, 23; b. melaninogenicus, 32; b. forsythus, 44; and b. buccalis,  2. however, sialidase activity was detected in only 29% of 7 b. buccae isolates,  79% of 14 b. disiens isolates, and 55% of 11 b. oralis isolates. sialidase activity was not detected among any of 13 isolates of b. gracilis, 12 isolates of b. ureolyticus, 61 isolates of b. intermedius, or 26 isolates of b. corporis. porphyromonas (bacteroides) asaccharolytica (20 isolates) and p. endodontalis (8  isolates) did not demonstrate sialidase activity, while 25 isolates of p. gingivalis were sialidase positive. sialidase activity was found in 10 (100%) of  10 isolates of capnocytophaga ochracea of c. sputigena but not in any of 4 c. gingivalis isolates. other gram-negative anaerobic or capnophilic bacteria, including the following, were negative for sialidase activity: fusobacterium nucleatum, 39 isolates; wolinella recta, 19 isolates; eikenella corrodens, 17 isolates; haemophilus aphrophilus, 10 isolates; and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 10 isolates. these data demonstrate sialidase activity in  several species of the genera bacteroides and porphyromonas and suggest that this characteristic may be useful for identification.
