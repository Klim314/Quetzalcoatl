TI  == sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. a new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  == the amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase s precursor from saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae and corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from escherichia coli and dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase g(2) precursor from pseudomonas strain, using the basic local alignment search tool (blast) and the position-specific iterated blast (psi-blast), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. the three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the clustal w program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase g(2) from the pseudomonas strain precursor. six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive psi-blast iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase y precursor, two bacillus stearothermophilus n-carbamyl-l-amino acid amidohydrolases and pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein c. the three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [s, g, a]-h-x-d-x-v; (ii) g-x-x-d; and  (iii) x-e-e. this new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly  reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the arge/dape/cpg2/yscs family.
