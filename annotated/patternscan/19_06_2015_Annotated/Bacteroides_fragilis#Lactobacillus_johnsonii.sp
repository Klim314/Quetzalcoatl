TI  == influence and effect of the human microbiome in allergy and asthma.
AB  == purpose of review: studies have illustrated that the healthy human microbiome (i.e. the communities of microbes, their genomic content and interaction with the host) plays a role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. perturbation of these communities is an emerging characteristic of an increasing number of inflammatory diseases. the goal of this article is to review the current literature on both respiratory and gut microbiomes and their established relationship with allergy and asthma. recent findings: multiple studies have demonstrated airway microbiota dysbiosis, characterized by proteobacteria expansion in the lower airways, to be a consistent trait of established adult asthma. members of this phylum are associated with disease features such as bronchial hyperreactivity or corticosteroid resistance. emerging evidence implicates the neonatal gut microbiome as playing a significant role in the development of childhood atopy, a common precursor to asthma. murine studies have demonstrated that specific bacterial species (e.g. lactobacillus johnsonii, bacteroides fragilis) and microbial metabolites (e.g. the short-chain fatty acid  propionate), when supplemented to animals, confer protection against allergen-induced airway disorders. summary: the emerging view of atopy and asthma is one consistently related to inappropriate microbial community composition and  function in both the airway and gastrointestinal tract. this opens up the possibility that strategies to rationally manipulate microbiota at these sites may represent a novel approach to disease prevention or management.

TI  == the beneficial effect of exopolysaccharides from bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03 on microbial diversity in mouse intestine.
AB  == background: the structure of exopolysaccharides (eps) produced by bifidobacterium and their beneficial effects on human health have been fully studied, but only a  few studies have investigated their influence on microbial diversity in the human/animal intestine. results: the strain named bifidobacterium bifidum wbin03  with high growth rate and exopolysaccharide (eps) yield was selected to study the effect of its eps on modifying the intestinal microbiota of mice. the results indicated that eps significantly increased the growth of lactobacilli and total anaerobic bacteria, and exerted their inhibition effect on the growth of enterobacteria, enterococci and bacteroides fragilis. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis indicated that the eps significantly increased the diversity of total bacteria and lactobacilli, but significantly decreased the diversity of enterobacteria. when receiving a low dose of eps, bacteroidales sp./lactobacillus sp. occupied the dominant position, and l. johnsonii, l. animalis and l. reuteri were identified as the dominant strains when receiving a  high concentration of eps. conclusion: the combination of viable cell count, dgge and sequencing was used as an effective method to assess the microbial diversity  in mouse intestine, and the benefit effect of eps from b. bifidum wbin03 on probiotics and antagonistic effect against pathogens would guaranteed the health  of their hosts.
