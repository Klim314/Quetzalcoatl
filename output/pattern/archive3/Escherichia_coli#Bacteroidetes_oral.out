in vitro bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength (red, green, and blue) light-emitting diode irradiation.
objective: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelengths, providing average power output and effects on three common pathogenic bacteria. background data: ultraviolet (uv) light kills bacteria, but the bactericidal effects of uv may not be unique, as 425 nm produces a similar effect. the bactericidal effects of light-emitting diode (led) wavelengths such as 625 and 525 nm have not been described. before conducting clinical trials, the appropriate wavelength with reasonable dose and exposure time should be established. materials and methods: the bactericidal effects of 625, 525, and 425 nm wavelength led irradiation were investigated in vitro for the anaerobic bacterium porphyromonas gingivalis and two aerobes (staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli dh5alpha). average power output was 6 mw/cm(2) for 1 h. the bacteria were exposed to led irradiation for 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (21.6, 43.2, 86.4, and 172.8 j/cm(2), respectively). led irradiation was performed during growth on agar and in broth. control bacteria were incubated without led irradiation. bacterial growth was expressed in colony-forming units (cfu) and at an optical density at 600 nm in agar and broth. results: the bactericidal effect of led phototherapy depended upon wavelength, power density, bacterial viable number, and bacteria species. the bactericidal effect of 425 and 525 nm irradiation varied depending upon the bacterial inoculation, compared with unirradiated samples and samples irradiated with red light. especially, p. gingivalis and e. coli dh5alpha were killed by 425 nm, and s. aureus growth was inhibited by 525 nm. however, the wavelength of 625 nm was not bactericidal for p. gingivalis, e. coli dh5alpha, or s. aureus. conclusions: irradiation at 625 nm light was not bactericidal to s. aureus, e. coli, and p. gingivalis, whereas wavelengths of 425 and 525 nm had bactericidal effects. s. aureus was also killed at 525 nm.
comparative effects of the immediate and the extended release formulations of ciprofloxacin on normal human intestinal microflora.
ciprofloxacin is a well-known fluoroquinolone, active in vitro against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the ecological effects of an orally administered extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin in comparison with an immediate-release formulation of ciprofloxacin on the normal human intestinal microflora. thirty-six healthy female subjects were included in the study. the extended-release formulation of ciprofloxacin was given as 500 mg once daily and the immediate-release formulation as 250 mg twice daily. the treatment period was 3 days. the microbiological investigation was blinded with respect to treatment. mean fecal concentration in the volunteers receiving the extended-release formulation ciprofloxacin was 453 mg/kg and in the immediate-release formulation ciprofloxacin volunteers, the mean fecal concentration was 392 mg/kg. the numbers of escherichia coli were significantly suppressed while the enterococci decreased moderately in both treatment groups. no toxigenic clostridium difficile strains were found. no major differences were observed between the two studied formulations on the normal human intestinal microflora.
identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.
hierarchical gene expression profiles of huvec stimulated by different lipid a structures obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli.
the ability of lipid a structural variants to elicit unique endothelial cell gene expression was examined by measuring global gene expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) using affymetrix full genome chips. two lipid a structural variants obtained from porphyromonas gingivalis designated pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as lps obtained from escherichia coli wild type and an e. coli msbb mutant (missing myristic acid in the lipid a) were examined. each of these lipid a structures has been shown to interact with tlr4; however, pglps(1435/1449) and e. coli msbb lps have been shown to be tlr4 antagonists while pglps(1690) and wild-type e. coli lps are tlr4 agonists. it was found that pglps(1435/1449) and pglps(1690) as well as e. coli msbb lps activated a subset of those genes significantly transcribed in response to e. coli wild-type lps. furthermore, the subset of genes expressed in response to the different lipid a structural forms were those most significantly activated by wild-type e. coli lps demonstrating a hierarchy in tlr4-dependent endothelial cell gene activation. a unique gene expression profile for the weak tlr4 agonist pglps(1690) was observed and represents a tlr4 hierarchy in endothelial cell gene activation.
expression of cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase on human gingival fibroblasts and contribution to the inhibition of interleukin-1alpha-induced granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor production.
background and objectives: cd73/5'-nucleotidase (5'-nt) is an ectoenzyme that participates in immune/inflammatory reactions. we examined the possible expression of cd73/5'-nt on human gingival fibroblasts (hgf), which are important to the immune/inflammatory system in periodontal tissue. methods and results: we demonstrated that cd73/5'-nt was expressed on hgf by flow cytometry. we found that pre-treatment of hgf with 5'-amp induced marked inhibition of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) production from hgf upon stimulation with interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). a specific inhibitor of 5'-nt, adenosine 5'-[alpha,beta-methylene] diphosphate blocked the inhibition of gm-csf production, suggesting that adenosine converted from 5'-amp acts on the inhibitory effects. the gm-csf inhibition suggested that a3 receptor might be involved. the rank order of agonists was found to be (n6-benzyl-5'-n-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) a3 receptor agonist > or = (2-chloroadenosine) non-selective agonist > (cgs-21680) a2a receptor agonist > adenosine > or = (n6-cyclohexyladenosine) a1 agonist. further support for the main role of a3 receptor was the binding a3 antagonist [9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)-5-([phenylacetyl]amino)[1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c]quinazdine] reversed the effect of adenosine, but no significant reverse was observed by a1 (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine), a2 [3,7-dimethyl-1-(2-propargyl)xanthine], a2a[8-(3-chlorostyryl)caffeine], and a2b (alloxazine) antagonists. the cd73/5'-nt expression was increased upon stimulation with gamma-interferon, but not other stimulants such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, il-4, lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis and escherichia coli, and fimbriae from p. gingivalis, and this increase was correlated with the enhanced gm-csf inhibition by 5'-amp but not adenosine. conclusions: these findings suggested that cd73/5'-nt on hgf exerts an anti-inflammatory effects in periodontal disease by conversion from 5'-amp to adenosine.
cloning and expression of a porphyromonas gingivalis gene for protoporphyrinogen  oxidase by complementation of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli.
porphyromonas gingivalis, a bacterium implicated in periodontal pathogenesis, has a growth requirement for iron protoporphyrin ix. by complementation with a p. gingivalis 381 chromosomal dna library, we were able to isolate a clone that enhanced the poor growth of a hemg mutant of escherichia coli. the dna sequence analysis of this clone revealed three open reading frames (orfs). orf3 encoded a protein of 466 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 51 695 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of the orf3 gene had significant similarity to sequences of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (ppo) from myxococcus xanthus (30% identical residues). when the orf3 gene was overexpressed in e. coli, the extract had much higher ppo activity than a control extract, and this activity was inhibited by acifluorfen, a specific inhibitor of ppo. thus, orf3 was named pghemg. furthermore, several porphyrin-related genes, including hemd, hemn and hemh, were identified in the data bases on the websites available on-line. we postulated that a porphyrin biosynthetic pathway to heme from preuroporphyrin may be conserved in p. gingivalis.
3-chloro-dl-alanine resistance by l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase activity.
the antibacterial agent 3-chloro-dl-alanine (3ca) is an inhibitor of peptidoglycan synthesis. fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria responsible for oral malodor, are shown to be resistant to 1 mm 3ca, whereas streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli are sensitive to this antibacterial agent at the same concentration. we isolated the 3ca resistance gene from f. nucleatum and showed that the gene encodes an l-methionine-alpha-deamino-gamma-mercaptomethane-lyase that catalyzes the alpha,gamma-elimination of l-methionine to produce methyl mercaptan. the enzyme also exhibits 3ca chloride-lyase (deaminating) activity. this antibacterial agent is expected to be useful for specific selection of malodorous oral bacteria producing high amounts of methyl mercaptan.
characterization of the porphyromonas gingivalis ftsz containing a novel gtpase activity.
the ftsz protein is a gtpase that is essential for cell division. we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed the ftsz (pgftsz) gene from the porphyromonas gingivalis, an oral, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium implicated in progressive periodontal disease. the pgftsz gene consisted of 1374 bp and coded for an acidic protein with a calculated molecular mass of 50,253 da. the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited a significant homology with e. coli ftsz (54% identical residues). like other prokaryotic ftszs, pgftsz possessed the clear motifs for gtp binding (gggtgtg) and hydrolysis (nldfadv). when pgftsz was overexpressed in e. coli, cell division was inhibited. recombinant pgftsz was purified to homogeneity and characterized. the purified pgftsz exhibited gtpase activity even in the absence of mg2+, and completely retained its activity with edta. furthermore, na+ and k+ ions inhibited its gtpase activity in a dose-dependent manner. these results suggest that pgftsz contains an atypical gtpase activity that has not been previously described.
modulation of chronic enteric infection by distant oral infection.
this investigation determined the effects of a distant oral infection (porphyromonas gingivalis) on a concurrent local enteric infection (echerichia coli). a modified murine subcutaneous tissue chamber model was used. subcutaneously implanted chambers with different microbial makeups were monitored for sloughing and their contents assayed for prostaglandin e2. bilaterally implanted chamber experiments revealed that a distant "chronic" (immunization with heat-killed organism, followed by live challenge) p. gingivalis infection offered protection against a local chronic e. coli infection, as evidenced by delaying the time for 50% of the chambers to reject from day 19 to day 25 and a statistically significant prostaglandin e2 decrease from 529.4 +/- 176.6 ng/ml to 191.5 +/- 100.9 ng/ml (p < 0.01) (mann-whitney test). an acute (live challenge only) distant p. gingivalis infection or immunization with the heat-killed organism alone had no effect on "chronic" e. coli infection in this model. these data suggest that the presence of low-grade chronic oral infection may modify the responses to other infectious challenges.
extracts of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
in order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as escherichia coli on bone formation, clone mc3t3-e1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. the addition of the sonicated extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. by contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus sanguis, and escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. the addition of prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. polymyxin b did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. the inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kda eluted from sephadex g-200 column. the inhibitory substances of prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kda by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. these results indicate that prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
host responses induced by co-infection with porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a murine model.
in this study, evidence is presented that mixed infection with the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans results in a synergistic effect in their pathogenicity and in their ability to induce humoral and cellular host responses. balb/c mice were injected subcutaneously on the back with p. gingivalis atcc 53977, a. actinomycetemocomitans 75 or a mixture of both bacteria. samples of blood and fluid from abscesses formed at the site of injection (first degree) or distant from the injection site were collected for microbiologic analysis. serum and spleens were obtained for evaluation of humoral and cellular responses to p. gingivalis and a actinomycetemocomitans. mice injected with a. actinomycetemcomitans had first-degree lesions only, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans had lesions at first- and second-degree sites from which both bacterial species were isolated. a serum anti-p. gingivalis response was induced in p. gingivalis-injected mice, which was higher in mice injected with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. this pattern was not seen in the anti-a, actinomycetemcomitans response. lymphoproliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide and p. gingivalis of spleen cells from infected mice were decreased, especially following co-infection. furthermore, co-infection of mice resulted in the greatest decrease in the number of cd5+, especially cd4+ lymphocytes.
effects of lipopolysaccharides on human dental pulp cells.
human dental pulp cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 micrograms/ml of lipopolysaccharide (lps). the effects of treatment were examined by measurement of the dna content, protein content, and alkaline phosphatase activity of the cells. lps samples were purified from porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum isolated from root canals, and escherichia coli 0111:b4 lps was used as a positive control. at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml, none of the lpss caused any change in the production of dna or protein, whereas the amount of dna was increased at 10 micrograms/ml and inhibited at 100 micrograms/ml. protein synthesis was decreased by lpss at both 10 and 100 micrograms/ml. alkaline phosphatase activity was not changed at any concentration of lps tested.
suppression of fibroblast growth by bacteroides gingivalis endotoxin is not reduced by serum lipoproteins.
previous studies indicated that bacteroides and e. coli endotoxins caused a dose-dependent inhibition of human fibroblast growth. however, these endotoxins were relatively weak inhibitors of growth. since cells were grown with serum, we questioned whether serum lipoproteins, which lessen endotoxin cytotoxicity in vivo, reduced the growth inhibitory effects of endotoxins in vitro. to determine whether serum lipoproteins reduced the growth inhibitory effects of endotoxins, logarithmically growing human periodontal cells were incubated with endotoxin and high density (hdl) or low density lipoprotein (ldl). neither hdl nor ldl significantly reduced the initial growth inhibitory effects of b. gingivalis or e. coli endotoxins, as judged by 3h-thymidine incorporation. even with prolonged exposure of up to 10 days in culture, hdl did not ameliorate growth inhibition by endotoxin, as determined by direct cell counts. we conclude that serum lipoproteins do not provide any significant protective effects against fibroblast growth inhibition by endotoxins in vitro.
activity of fce 22891 compared with cefuroxime axetil and cefixime in pulmonary and subcutaneous infections in mice.
the therapeutic activity of fce 22891 was compared with that of two new oral cephalosporins, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime against streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection and subcutaneous abscesses induced by mixed aerobes and anaerobes in mice. in experimental pneumonia fce 22891 was the most active antibiotic. in aerobic abscesses fce 22891 proved the most active agent in infections induced by methicillin susceptible and resistant staphylococcus aureus while all three compounds were very active, against str. pyogenes. in abscesses caused by gram-negative bacteria, fce 22891 showed good and constant efficacy. cefixime was the most active drug against the two susceptible strains of escherichia coli and enterobacter cloacae and also against resistant esch. coli but was inactive against a strain of ent. cloacae that produced cephalosporinase. cefuroxime axetil was less active than the other two drugs against gram-negative bacteria with adequate efficacy only against a susceptible strain of ent. cloacae. fce 22891 was more effective than cefixime and cefuroxime axetil in preventing and reducing the size of abscesses induced by bacteroides fragilis 101. we conclude that fce 22891, despite its short half life of 6 min in mice, exerts comparable and sometimes better activity than the two oral cephalosporins characterized by longer half lives.
