TI  == clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  == some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. these gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include clostridium botulinum (c2 toxin), clostridium difficile (c. difficile toxin or cdt), clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or bec), clostridium spiroforme (c. spiroforme toxin or cst), as well as bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or vip). these gut-acting proteins form an ab complex composed of adp-ribosyl transferase (a) and cell-binding (b) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. once inside the cytosol, the a components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-adp-ribosylation  of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.

TI  == cd44 promotes intoxication by the clostridial iota-family toxins.
AB  == various pathogenic clostridia produce binary protein toxins associated with enteric diseases of humans and animals. separate binding/translocation (b) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (a) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. ultimately there is translocation of a component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. our results revealed that cd44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. specific antibody against cd44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical clostridium perfringens iota toxin. versus cd44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking  cd44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to c. perfringens iota, as well as clostridium difficile and clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. purified cd44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related clostridium botulinum c2, toxins. furthermore, cd44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. collective data reveal an important role for cd44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.

TI  == identification of the cellular receptor of clostridium spiroforme toxin.
AB  == clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxin cst (c. spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. here we report on the recombinant production of the enzyme component (csta) and the binding component (cstb) of c. spiroforme toxin in bacillus megaterium. by using the recombinant toxin components, we show that cst enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (lsr), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins clostridium difficile transferase (cdt) and clostridium perfringens iota toxin. microscopic studies revealed that cst, but not the related clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, colocalized with lsr during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. our findings indicate that cst shares lsr with c. difficile cdt and c. perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.

TI  == clostridial binary toxins: iota and c2 family portraits.
AB  == there are many pathogenic clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. some of these bacteria, such as c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals as well as humans. these often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary  protein toxins that follow a classic ab paradigm. within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-adp-ribosylation of  globular actin by the a component. however, much less is known about b component  binding to cell-surface receptors. these toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: bacillus anthracis. this review focuses upon the iota and c2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. in summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus clostridium.

TI  == binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins and their use as molecular trojan horses for drug delivery into eukaryotic cells.
AB  == binary bacterial toxins are unique ab-type toxins, composed of two non-linked proteins that act as a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component. all known actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridia possess this binary structure. this toxin family is comprised of the prototypical clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin, clostridium difficile cdt, and clostridium spiroforme toxin. once in the cytosol of host cells, these toxins transfer an adp-ribose moiety from nicotinamide-adenosine-dinucleotide onto g-actin that then leads to depolymerization of actin filaments. in recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, and in particular that of c2 toxin. both components act in a precisely concerted manner to intoxicate eukaryotic cells. the binding/translocation (b-) component forms a complex with the enzyme (a-) component and mediates toxin binding to a cell-surface receptor.  following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the enzyme component escapes from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. acidification of endosomes triggers pore formation by the binding/translocation component in endosomal membranes and the enzyme component subsequently translocates through the pore. this step requires a host cell chaperone, hsp90. due to their unique structure, binary toxins are naturally "tailor made" for transporting foreign proteins into the cytosol of host cells. several highly specific and cell-permeable recombinant fusion proteins have been  designed and successfully used in experimental cell research. this review will focus on the recent progress in studying binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins as  highly effective virulence factors and innovative tools for cell physiology as well as pharmacology.

TI  == binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common clostridium and bacillus proteins.
AB  == certain pathogenic species of bacillus and clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "a-b" paradigm for protein toxins. the binary toxins produced by b. anthracis, b. cereus, c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme consist of components  not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. the "b" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. following release of a 20-kda n-terminal peptide, the activated "b" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "a" component(s) on the cell surface. by following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "a" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic amp, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. recently, b. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately b. anthracis. this review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each clostridium and bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. the information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.

TI  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin: binding studies and characterization of cell  surface receptor by fluorescence-activated cytometry.
AB  == the binding characteristics of iota toxin, a binary enterotoxin produced by clostridium perfringens type e, were studied by fluorescence-activated cytometry. the proteolytically activated binding component of iota toxin, iota b (ib), bound to various cell types when incubated at 4, 25, or 37 degrees c for 10 min. the binding of ib was inhibited by antisera against c. perfringens type e or clostridium spiroforme culture supernatants, but not c. perfringens types c or d. pretreatment of vero cells with glycosidases or lectins did not affect ib interactions, while pronase effectively prevented ib binding to the cell surface. the ib protomer (ibp) bound to the cell surface, but trypsinization of ibp was necessary for docking of the adp-ribosylating component, iota a (ia). ia attached to cell-bound ib within 10 min at 37 degrees c, but surface levels of ia decreased 90% after 30 min and were undetectable by 60 min. detectable surface levels of ib also diminished over time, and western blot analysis suggested internalization or embedment of ib into the membrane.

TI  == a recombinant bacillus anthracis strain producing the clostridium perfringens ib  component induces protection against iota toxins.
AB  == the bacillus anthracis toxinogenic sterne strain is currently used as a live veterinary vaccine against anthrax. the capacity of a toxin-deficient derivative  strain to produce a heterologous antigen by using the strong inducible promoter of the b. anthracis pag gene was investigated. the expression of the foreign gene ibp, encoding the ib component of iota toxin from clostridium perfringens, was analyzed. a pag-ibp fusion was introduced by allelic exchange into a toxin-deficient sterne strain, thereby replacing the wild-type pag gene. this recombinant strain, called baib, was stable and secreted large quantities of ib protein in induced culture conditions. mice given injections of live baib spores  developed an antibody response specific to the ib protein. the pag-ibp fusion was therefore functional both in vitro and in vivo. moreover, the immunized animals were protected against a challenge with c. perfringens iota toxin or with the homologous clostridium spiroforme toxin. the protective immunity was mediated by  neutralizing antibodies. in conclusion, b. anthracis is promising for the development of live veterinary vaccines.

TI  == production of a complete binary toxin (actin-specific adp-ribosyltransferase) by  clostridium difficile cd196.
AB  == a clostridium difficile isolate was found to produce an actin-specific adp-ribosyltransferase (cdt) homologous to the enzymatic components of clostridium perfringens iota toxin and clostridium spiroforme toxin (m. r. popoff, e. j. rubin, d. m. gill, and p. boquet, infect. immun. 56:2299-2306, 1988). the cdt locus from c. difficile cd196 was cloned and sequenced. it contained two genes (cdta and cdtb) which display organizations and sequences similar to those of the iota toxin gene. the deduced enzymatic (cdta) and binding (cdtb) components have 81 and 84% identity, respectively, with the corresponding  components of iota toxin. cdta and cdtb induced actin cytoskeleton alterations similar to those caused by other clostridial binary toxins. the lower level of production of binary toxin by cd196 than of iota toxin by c. perfringens was related to a lower transcript level, possibly due to a promoter region different  from that of iota toxin genes. the cdta and cdtb genes have been detected in 3 of 24 clinical isolates examined, and cdtb alone was found in 2 additional strains.  one strain (in addition to cd196) was shown by western blotting to produce cdta and cdtb. these results indicate that some c. difficile strains synthesize a binary toxin that could be an additional virulence factor.

TI  == immunological and functional comparison between clostridium perfringens iota toxin, c. spiroforme toxin, and anthrax toxins.
AB  == clostridium perfringens iota and c. spiroforme toxins consist of two separate proteins. one is the binding component and the other the enzymatic component. the two toxins secreted by bacillus anthracis are composed of binary combinations of  three proteins: protective antigen, lethal factor, and edema factor. as shown by  western blotting and elisa, the binding component of anthrax toxin shares common  epitopes with that of iota toxin and c. spiroforme toxin which are closely related immunologically. however, no functional complementation was observed between iota toxin and anthrax toxin components. the binding components can form  toxins active on macrophages only in combination with their respective enzymatic  components. agents which prevent acidification of endosomes do not have the same  effects on anthrax toxin activity as they do on iota and c. spiroforme toxins. therefore, the mechanisms of entry into the cells are presumably different. since the binding components of anthrax toxins and iota toxin share a conserved putative translocation domain, these binding components could have a common mode  of insertion into the cell membranes.

TI  == incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

TI  == clostridial disease of the gut.
AB  == clostridia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. some of the most common clostridial infections are those of the gut. the primary infections in humans are clostridium perfringens food poisoning and clostridium difficile-mediated antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis. less common but important infections include non-food poisoning c. perfringens nosocomial diarrhea and c. perfringens type c necrotizing jejunitis (pig-bel). c. perfringens is also the dominant cause of gastrointestinal infections in animals, although clostridium septicum causing braxy in sheep, clostridium colinum causing ulcerative enteritis is avian species, and clostridium spiroforme causing enterotoxemia in rabbits are important exceptions.

TI  == clostridial adp-ribosylating toxins: effects on atp and gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == the actin cytoskeleton appears to be as the cellular target of various clostridial adp-ribosyltransferases which have been described during recent years. clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin and clostridium spiroforme toxin adp-ribosylate actin monomers and inhibit actin polymerization. clostridium botulinum exoenzyme c3 and clostridium limosum exoenzyme adp-ribosylate the low-molecular-mass gtp-binding proteins of the rho family, which participate in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. adp-ribosylation inactivates the regulatory rho proteins and disturbs the organization of the actin cytoskeleton.

TI  == characterization of clostridium perfringens iota-toxin genes and expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the iota toxin which is produced by clostridium perfringens type e, is a binary toxin consisting of two independent polypeptides: ia, which is an adp-ribosyltransferase, and ib, which is involved in the binding and internalization of the toxin into the cell. two degenerate oligonucleotide probes deduced from partial amino acid sequence of each component of c. spiroforme toxin, which is closely related to the iota toxin, were used to clone three overlapping dna fragments containing the iota-toxin genes from c. perfringens type e plasmid dna. two genes, in the same orientation, coding for ia (387 amino  acids) and ib (875 amino acids) and separated by 243 noncoding nucleotides were identified. a predicted signal peptide was found for each component, and the secreted ib displays two domains, the propeptide (172 amino acids) and the mature protein (664 amino acids). the ia gene has been expressed in escherichia coli and c. perfringens, under the control of its own promoter. the recombinant polypeptide obtained was recognized by ia antibodies and adp-ribosylated actin. the expression of the ib gene was obtained in e. coli harboring a recombinant plasmid encompassing the putative promoter upstream of the ia gene and the ia and ib genes. two residues which have been found to be involved in the nad+ binding site of diphtheria and pseudomonas toxins are conserved in the predicted ia sequence (glu-14 and trp-19). the predicted amino acid ib sequence shows 33.9% identity with and 54.4% similarity to the protective antigen of the anthrax toxin complex. in particular, the central region of ib, which contains a predicted transmembrane segment (leu-292 to ser-308), presents 45% identity with the corresponding protective antigen sequence which is involved in the translocation  of the toxin across the cell membrane.

TI  == the enteritis complex in domestic rabbits: a field study.
AB  == a study of the causative agents of enteritis in domestic rabbits from 44 different accessions is described. in descending order of frequency, the organisms most commonly demonstrated were intestinal and hepatic coccidia (eimeria species), escherichia coli, clostridium spp., salmonella, bacillus piliformis, and rotavirus. the species of eimeria identified included those moderately pathogenic and coccidia of low pathogenicity. using seven antisera against known enterpathogenic strains of e. coli, only one strain, o15, was identified in three cases. clostridium perfringens or c. spiroforme was demonstrated in the intestinal contents in 11 cases, and lesions compatible with  clostridial enteropathy were identified on gross and histopathology. in a serological survey, over 50% of 200 fryer rabbits submitted to ontario abattoirs  and of animals from commercial rabbitries had detectable antibody to rotavirus, indicating the widespread distribution of rotaviral infections in this species. in the cases of enteritis studied, two or more potentially pathogenic organisms were frequently identified, emphasizing that several different organisms may be acting in concert to produce clinical disease.

TI  == mechanisms of the cytopathic action of actin-adp-ribosylating toxins.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin, and clostridium spiroforme toxin adp-ribosylate actin monomers. toxin-induced adp-ribosylation disturbs the cellular equilibrium between monomeric and polymeric actin and traps monomeric actin in its unpolymerized form, thereby depolymerizing actin filaments and destroying the microfilament network. furthermore, the toxins adp-ribosylate gelsolin actin complexes. these modifications may contribute to the cytopathic action of the toxins.

TI  == cellular and molecular actions of binary toxins possessing adp-ribosyltransferase activity.
AB  == clostridial organisms produce a number of binary toxins. thus far, three complete toxins (botulinum, perfringens and spiroforme) and one incomplete toxin (difficile) have been identified. in the case of complete toxins, there is a heavy chain component (mr approximately 100,000) that binds to target cells and helps create a docking site for the light chain component (mr approximately 50,000). the latter is an enzyme that possesses mono(adp-ribosyl)transferase activity. the toxins appear to proceed through a three step sequence to exert their effects, including a binding step, an internalization step and an intracellular poisoning step. the substrate for the toxins is g-actin. by virtue  of adp-ribosylating monomeric actin, the toxins prevent polymerization as well as promoting depolymerization. the most characteristic cellular effect of the toxins is alteration of the cytoskeleton, which leads directly to changes in cellular morphology and indirectly to changes in cell function (e.g. release of chemical mediators). binary toxins capable of modifying actin are likely to be useful tools in the study of cell biology.

TI  == purification of the clostridium spiroforme binary toxin and activity of the toxin on hep-2 cells.
AB  == the two components sa (mr, 44,000) and sb (mr, 92,000) of clostridium spiroforme  toxin were identified and characterized. serological data permitted the identification of two groups of actin adp-ribosylating clostridial toxins. the first consists of only c. botulinum c2. the second group includes spiroforme toxin, iota toxin of c. perfringens e, and an enzyme called cdt found in one strain of c. difficile, antibodies against which cross-react with all of the members of both groups. c. spiroforme toxin acted on cells by disrupting microfilaments by adp-ribosylation of g actin. toxicity was not blocked by 10 or  20 mm ammonium chloride and was only moderately inhibited by 30 mm nh4cl. inhibition of coated-pit formation in hep-2 cells by potassium depletion strongly protected against the effect of c. spiroforme toxin. toxicity was not blocked by  incubation of hep-2 cells and spiroforme toxin at 15 degrees c. these results suggest that this new binary toxin enters cells via the coated-pit-coated-vesicle pathway and might reach the cytoplasm at the same time as or before transfer to early endosomes.

TI  == production by clostridium spiroforme of an iotalike toxin that possesses mono(adp-ribosyl)transferase activity: identification of a novel class of adp-ribosyltransferases.
AB  == clostridium spiroforme iotalike toxin produced time- and concentration-dependent  incorporation of adp-ribose into homo-poly-l-arginine. polyasparagine, polyglutamic acid, polylysine, and agmatine were poor substrates. enzyme activity was associated with the light-chain polypeptide of the toxin. the heavy chain did not possess adp-ribosyltransferase activity, nor did it enhance or inhibit activity of the light chain. in broken-cell assays, the toxin acted mainly on g-actin, rather than f-actin. a single adp-ribose group was transferred to each substrate molecule (g-actin). the enzyme was heat sensitive, had a ph optimum in  the range of 7 to 8, was inhibited by high concentrations of nicotinamide, and was reversibly denatured by urea and guanidine. physiological levels of nucleotides (amp, adp, atp, and adp-ribose) and cations (na+, k+, ca2+, and mg2+) were not very active as enzyme inhibitors. the toxin was structurally and functionally similar to clostridium botulinum type c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin. when combined with previous findings, the data suggest that a new class of mono(adp-ribosyl)ating toxins has been found and that these agents belong to a related and possibly homologous series of binary toxins.

TI  == clostridium spiroforme toxin is a binary toxin which adp-ribosylates cellular actin.
AB  == we have purified from clostridium spiroforme strain 246 an heterogeneous population of proteins (sa) ranging from 43 to 47 kilodaltons exhibiting adp-ribosyl transferase activity as do c. botulinum c2 toxin component i or the ia chain of c. perfringens e iota toxin. c. spiriforme sa had alone no activity upon injection in mice or inoculated to vero cells. when spiroforme adp ribosyl transferase were mixed with a trypsin activated protein (sb) separated from c. spiroforme bacterial supernatant, a lethal effect in mice and cytotoxicity on vero cells were recorded. the sa cross-reacted immunologically with either the light chain of c. perfringens e iota toxin or the adp-ribosyl transferase from c. difficile 196 strain. no immunological relatedness was observed between sa and c2 toxin component i. c. spiroforme toxin is thus another binary toxin close to iota.

TI  == clostridium perfringens iota toxin: synergism between two proteins.
AB  == the iota toxin of clostridium perfringens type e is a guinea pig dermonecrotic, mouse lethal toxin which cross-reacts with the iota-like toxin of clostridium spiroforme. antiserum raised against c. spiroforme or c. perfringens type e neutralizes the toxin from both species. by using c. spiroforme antiserum and crossed immunoelectrophoresis, we have found that there are two cross-reacting proteins, designated iota a (ia) and iota b (ib) in the culture filtrate of c. perfringens type e. both proteins of c. perfringens were separated by preparative isoelectric focusing and had very little toxic activity when tested alone. however, when they were recombined there were 8- and 25-fold increases in bioactivity as determined by mouse lethal and guinea pig dermonecrotic assays, respectively. these results demonstrate that the iota toxin of c. perfringens requires two immunologically and biochemically different proteins for maximum activity.

TI  == clostridial toxins active locally in the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == clostridium difficile and clostridium spiroforme have only in recent years been recognized as intestinal pathogens. they both produce toxins that are also produced by other clostridia. c. difficile toxins a and b are produced by c. sordellii and a few strains of c. perfringens whereas c. spiroforme produces the  same toxins as c. perfringens type e (iota toxin). iota toxin activity may be the product of two proteins. toxigenic strains of c. spiroforme and type e produce two antigens which possess much more biological activity when administered together than when given alone. c. difficile was thought for some time to produce only a single toxin, but then the enterotoxic activity was shown to be due to a separate toxin (toxin a). this toxin increases the oral toxicity of toxin b (the  main cytotoxin) and may increase the permeability of the colon. toxin a binds to  a specific receptor in hamster brush border membranes and in the membranes of rabbit erythrocytes. this receptor appears to be a glycoprotein. the receptor can be extracted from the membrane with triton and binds to immobilized toxin a. the  receptor can be extracted and used to coat plastic plates as a first phase in an  elisa assay. another assay has been developed in which the toxin a binds to the red cells and then the erythrocytes are agglutinated with antitoxin. an even more sensitive assay consists of using rabbit erythrocyte ghosts to bind the toxin and then precipitating the ghosts with antibody to toxin a attached to latex beads. monoclonal antibodies to toxin a also have been developed and are used in these and other assays.
