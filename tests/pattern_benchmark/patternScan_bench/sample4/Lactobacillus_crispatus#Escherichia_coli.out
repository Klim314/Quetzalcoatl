spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef with added lactic  acid bacteria displayed at abusive temperatures.
growth of pathogenic organisms such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. can be inhibited in ground beef through the addition of certain lactic acid-producing bacteria (lab; lactobacillus acidophilus np51, lactobacillus crispatus np35, pediococcus acidilactici, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis). this study evaluated the effects of lab inclusion on the organoleptic and biochemical properties typically associated with spoilage in traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive (10 degrees c) temperatures for 36 h. trained and untrained panelist evaluations of lean color and off-odor, as well as instrumental color analyses, did not indicate an effect on spoilage traits due to lab utilization (p > 0.05). however, display length affected each variable independently and was indicative of decreased stability and acceptability as display time (h) increased (p < 0.05). thiobarbituric acid values were decreased for ground beef with added lab (p < 0.05), but likely can be related to bacterial degradation of lipid oxidation by-products because no reduction in organoleptic traits due to oxidation was noted between treatments. overall, lab did not adversely influence the spoilage characteristics of traditionally packaged ground beef displayed at abusive temperatures for up to 36 h. furthermore, biochemical and sensory indicators of spoilage were present for all treatments at the conclusion of display. therefore, lab can be added to ground beef in traditional packaging as a processing intervention without masking or delaying the expected spoilage characteristics.
the s-layer proteins of lactobacillus crispatus strain zj001 is responsible for competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium.
lactobacillus crispatus zj001, isolated from pig intestines and identified by sequencing analysis based on partial 16s rrna gene, was examined in vitro for probiotic activity exerted by the surface layer proteins (s-layer). the characteristics of l. crispatus zj001 were compared to lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356 from the same genus which also produces the s-layer proteins. the strain zj001 was resistant to acidic condition and bile salt. its antagonistic properties such as adhesion, inhibition of the pathogen growth and competitive exclusion against escherichia coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were apparently advantageous over l. acidophilus atcc 4356. sds-page analysis of cell surface proteins revealed the presence of s-layer proteins, approximately at 42 kda in l. crispatus zj001. removal of the s-layer proteins reduced autoaggregation and adhesion to hela cells. the functional role of the s-layer proteins in adhesion was also confirmed by the antibody-mediated inhibition assay using the polyclonal antibody against the s-layer protein. the s-layer proteins from l. crispatus zj001 inhibited adhesion of s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7 to hela cells. these results suggest that l. crispatus zj001 possesses probiotic properties and the s-layer proteins are involved in the adhesion and competitive exclusion of pathogens to hela cells.
in vitro adhesion of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli o78 strain to surfaces  of the chicken intestinal tract and to ileal mucus.
the role of fimbria in adherence of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec) o78 strain 789 to chicken intestine was studied. bacterial adhesion to tissue sections representing the regions within the chicken intestinal tract was determined by using immunohistochemical methods. e. coli 789 grown to express the type 1 fimbria adhered efficiently to the crop epithelium, to the lamina propria of intestinal villi, and to the apical surfaces of both the mature as well as the crypt-located enterocytes in intestinal villi, whereas no adhesion to mucus-producing goblet cells was detected. the adhesion was inhibited by mannoside and the role of type 1 fimbriae in the observed adhesion was confirmed with a recombinant strain expressing type 1 fimbriae genes cloned from e. coli and salmonella enterica. e. coli 789 strain grown to favor ac/i fimbriae expression as well as the recombinant e. coli strain expressing the fac genes adhered to goblet cells but only poorly to the other epithelial sites. e. coli strain 789 as well as s. enterica serovar typhimurium ir715 and s. enterica serovar enteriditis tn2 strains were able to multiply in ileal mucus medium. the type 1 fimbria expressing bacteria adhered to the ileal mucus, whereas the ac/i fimbriated strains showed poor adherence to the mucus. the adhesion of e. coli 789 onto the crop epithelium and the follicle associated epithelium of the chicken ileum was efficiently inhibited by an adhesive strain st1 of lactobacillus crispatus isolated from chicken, whereas poor inhibition of e. coli adherence was observed with the weakly adhesive l. crispatus strain 134mi. the type 1 fimbriae may be important in colonization of the chicken intestine by apec and salmonella.
inhibition of the adherence of escherichia coli strains to basement membrane by lactobacillus crispatus expressing an s-layer.
aims: this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency with which lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 inhibited the adhesion of enteric pathogens to a synthetic basement membrane and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the inhibition. methods and results: lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 inhibited the adhesion of three diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli strains to a reconstituted basement membrane preparation called matrigel, used as a model of a damaged intestinal tissue site. inhibition was also observed with the use of immobilized laminin, a major component of matrigel, but diminished after the removal of s-layer protein (cbsa) from jcm 5810 cells. the isolated cbsa inhibited the adhesion of e. coli to both matrigel and immobilized laminin. lactobacillus crispatus jcm 5810 and cbsa seem to inhibit pathogenic e. coli from adhering to basement membrane via competition with laminin molecules for binding sites. conclusions: these results suggested that not only lact. crispatus jcm 5810 cells but cbsa alone might prevent pathogens from colonizing damaged intestinal tissues. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study to show the applied aspect of lactobacillus s-layer protein.
