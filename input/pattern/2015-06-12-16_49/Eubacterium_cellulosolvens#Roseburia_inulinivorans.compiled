TI  - Transfer of conjugative elements from rumen and human Firmicutes bacteria to Roseburia inulinivorans.
AB  - Studies on Firmicutes bacteria from the gut are hampered by a lack of gene transfer systems. Here the human colonic anaerobe Roseburia inulinivorans A2-194 was shown to be a transfer recipient for two conjugative transposons, Tn1545 from Eubacterium cellulosolvens and TnK10 from Clostridium saccharolyticum K10.
