TI  - Clinical effect of biapenem on nursing and healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP).
AB  - The clinical effect of Biapenem (BIPM) on Nursing and Healthcare-associated pneumonia (NHCAP) was evaluated. One hundred and three NHCAP patients (Group B: 52 patients, Group C: 51 patients) to whom BIPM was administered were included in this study. Clinical effect, bacteriological effect, and adverse events were examined. Results revealed efficacy in 45 of 52 patients (efficacy rate: 86.5%) of NHCAP Group B, and 43 of 51 patients (efficacy rate: 84.3%) of NHCAP Group C, 88 of 103 patients (efficacy rate: 85.4%) as a whole. As for bacteriological effect, 10 (76.9%) of 13 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 9 (90.0%) of 10 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 7 (87.5%) of 8 methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus strains, and 7 (100%) of 7 Streptococcus pneumonia strains were eradicated. As a whole, 38 (80.9%) of 47 strains were eradicated. Adverse events included drug fever and drug eruption in one patient each, and abnormal laboratory findings, including mild hepatic dysfunction in 18 patients and mild renal dysfunction in 5 patients. Based on the above, it was concluded that BIPM shows excellent clinical effect on NHCAP with fewer adverse events.
TI  - Destruction-free procedure for the isolation of bacteria from sputum samples for  Raman spectroscopic analysis.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections are the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Here, a timely identification of the causing pathogens is crucial to the success of the treatment. Raman spectroscopy allows for quick identification of bacterial cells without the need for time-consuming cultivation steps, which is the current gold standard to detect pathogens. However, before Raman spectroscopy can be used to identify pathogens, they have to be isolated from the sample matrix, i.e., sputum in case of lower respiratory tract infections. In this study, we report an isolation protocol for single bacterial cells from sputum samples for Raman spectroscopic identification. Prior to the isolation, a liquefaction step using the proteolytic enzyme mixture Pronase E is required in order to deal with the high viscosity of sputum. The extraction of the bacteria was subsequently performed via different filtration and centrifugation steps, whereby isolation ratios between 46 and 57 % were achieved for sputa spiked with 6.107 to 6.104 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus. The compatibility of such a liquefaction and isolation procedure towards a Raman spectroscopic classification was shown for five different model species, namely S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A classification of single-cell Raman spectra of these five species with an accuracy of 98.5 % could be achieved on the basis of a principal component analysis (PCA) followed by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). These classification results could be validated with an independent test dataset, where 97.4 % of all spectra were identified correctly. Graphical Abstract Development of an isolation protocol of bacterial cells out of sputum samples followed by Raman spectroscopic measurement and species identification using chemometrical models.
TI  - Antimicrobial, antitumor and brine shrimp lethality assay of Ranunculus arvensis  L. extracts.
AB  - To investigate the antitumor activity, brine shrimp lethality assay, antibacterial and antifungal activity of Methanol Extract (ME), Water Extract (WE), Acetone Extract (AE), Chloroform Extract (CE), Methanol-Water Extract (MWE), Methanol-Acetone Extract (MAE), Methanol-Chloroform Extract (MCE) of Ranunculus arvensis (L.). Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At10) induced potato disc assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with brine shrimp lethality assay. Antibacterial activity was evaluated with six bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus and Streptococcus anginosus and antifungal screening was done against five fungal strains including Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigates, Fusarium solani and Mucor species by using disc diffusion method. Best antitumor activity was obtained with ME and WE, having highest IC50 values 20.27 +/- 1.62 and 93.01 +/- 1.33mug/disc. Brine shrimp lethality assay showed LC50 values of AE, MAE and ME were obtained as 384.66 +/- 9.42mug/ml, 724.11 +/- 8.01mug/ml and 978.7 +/-8.01 mug/ml respectively. WE of R. arvensis revealed weak antimicrobial result against the tested microorganisms. On the other hand, the antifungal activity of the plant extracts was found to be insignificant. These findings demonstrate that extracts of R. arvensis possesses significant antitumor activity. Further extensive study is necessary to assess the therapeutic potential of the plant.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but as these are often slow, negative or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two mRT-PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum samples down to a concentration of 100 cfu/reaction (8333 cfu/ml). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. Specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputa, 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  - [Th17 lymphocytes in bacterial infections].
AB  - Th17 cells are a relatively newly discovered subpopulation of helper CD4+ T lymphocytes. It has been shown that these cells may contribute to tissue damage during certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and also play an important role in antitumor and antimicrobial, particularly antibacterial, immunity. Bacteria stimulate the Th17 response through several Toll-like (TLR), NOD-like (NLR) and C-type lectin (CLR) receptors. When activated, Th17 lymphocytes produce several cytokines, mainly interleukin (IL)-17 and chemokines, that further attract and activate phagocytes to mediate bacterial clearance. Thus Th17 cells contribute to induction of host protective immunity, particularly against extracellular bacterial pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Furthermore, numerous studies indicate the importance of Th17 lymphocytes in immunity against intracellular bacteria such as Francisella tularensis and Chlamydia muridarum. In this case, the protective immune response is mediated mainly through stimulation of local dendritic cell (DC) function for establishing a Th1 immune response, indispensable for controlling intracellular infectious agents. However, deregulation of the Th17/IL17 response during bacterial infections may lead to profound pathologies. As a result, Th17 cells participate in chronic inflammatory diseases, leading to tissue destruction and favoring tumor development. This article summarizes current understanding of the bacteriainduced Th17 response in the context of the protective immune response and immunopathology.
TI  - Biological activities and DNA interactions of Amanita ovoidea.
AB  - CONTEXT: Amanita ovoidea (Bull.) Link (Amanitaceae) is a well-known species due to its pleasant aroma and flavor since ancient times in the worldwide. This species is also known in Turkey and people consume it extensively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate medicinal importance of A. ovoidea for human health, to explain the effect of mushroom extracts on bacterial DNA, and to find preventive role on bacterial disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chloroform, acetone, and methanol extracts of A. ovoidea were tested for the antimicrobial activities against four Gram-positive bacteria, five Gram-negative bacteria, and yeast using a micro-dilution method. In addition, DNA binding, DNA cleavage activity, and restriction enzyme digestion of the methanol extract of A. ovoidea were examined at different concentrations (40.000-78.125 microg/mL). RESULTS: The highest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value observed against the test micro-organisms was with the chloroform extract (MIC 19.5 microg/mL concentration) against Candida albicans. Other highest antimicrobial effects observed against the test micro-organisms were with the methanol extracts against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella enteritidis (MICs, 78 microg/mL concentrations). All concentrations reduced the mobility of plasmid DNA. BamHI and HindIII targeted specially to supercoils and cut them. Amanita ovoidea extract prevented cutting with HindIII by binding especially to the AA region in open circular DNA. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Present results demonstrated that A. ovoidea has excellent antimicrobial and antifungal activities by its DNA interaction activity on pBR322.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the surveillance committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010: General view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The nationwide surveillance on antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, was conducted by Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2010. The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period from January and April 2010 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes using maximum 45 antibacterial agents. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 954 strains (206 Staphylococcus aureus, 189 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 182 Haemophilus influenzae, 74 Moraxella catarrhalis, 139 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was as high as 50.5%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were 1.1% and 0.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 17.6% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant, 33.5% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant and 11.0% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant strains. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae and multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa with metallo beta-lactamase were 2.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Continuous national surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Burden of bacterial meningitis: a retrospective review on laboratory parameters and factors associated with death in meningitis, kelantan malaysia.
AB  - To describe the clinical characteristics and the risk factors associated with mortality in patients with meningitis. This is a retrospective review of patients diagnosed to have meningitis with positive culture of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimen. All cases aged 19 > years who were admitted to Hospital USM between January 2004 and December 2011 were included in the study. The CSF results database were obtained from the Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Hospital USM, Kelantan. A checklist was used to record the clinical characteristics. A total of 125 cases met the inclusion criteria. The age of patients ranged between newborn and 19 years old (Mean+/-SD, 74.5+/-80.6 months). The majority of them were males (65.6%). Fever was the most common presentation (73.6%) followed by poor oral intake (48.0%), seizure (36.0%) and headache (24.8%). The mortality rate was 31.2%. Coagulase negative staphylococcus was the most frequent pathogens isolated (21.6%), followed by Acinetobacter spp. (17.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.6%), Streptococcus spp. (11.2%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%). There were significant association of in-hospital death with age (p=0.020) and conscious level (p=0.001). Infectious meningitis is a big health concern, especially among children. We found that coagulase negative staphylococcus, Acinetobacter species, S. aureus, Streptococcus spp and K. pneumoniae were prevalent in our hospital. These microorganisms were hospital associated pathogens. The 31% mortality linked to hospital acquired meningitis specifies the need for focused physician attention especially among younger aged patients.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - Special references to bacteria isolated between April 2011 and March 2012].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. Five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Collinsella aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by P micra and L. acidophilus, in this order. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides caccae, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and B. wadsworthia, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.
TI  - Comparison of the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae  and Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis.
AB  - This multicenter, retrospective cohort study compared the clinical characteristics and outcomes of community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis (CA-KPM) with those of community-acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis (CA-SPM). Eighty-three adult patients, 27 with CA-KPM and 56 with CA-SPM, were included. Diabetes mellitus (48.1% versus 21.4%; P=0.01) and liver cirrhosis (22.2% versus 5.4%; P=0.05) were more commonly associated with CA-KPM. Comatose mental status (40.7% versus 12.5%; P=0.01), septic shock (44.4% versus 8.9%; P<0.001), and concomitant extrameningeal infections (40.7% versus 7.1%; P=0.001) were also more common in the CA-KPM group. The 28-day mortality (44.4% versus 10.7%; P<0.001) and inhospital mortality (51.9% versus 14.3%; P<0.001) were higher in the CA-KPM group. In conclusion, diabetes mellitus and liver cirrhosis are more common in the CA-KPM patients who were also more likely to present with severe manifestations and poor outcomes.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against European Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Recent clinical isolates of key Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four European countries (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/L avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. Against Enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. MIC90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90% of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. A two-fold reduction in the MIC90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/L was noted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam, whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the MIC values of the test compounds when tested against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates. Avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Haemophilus influenzae. It had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. This study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa but not against A. baumannii.
TI  - [Analysis of pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in neonatal purulent meningitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotics resistance of neonatal purulent meningitis in order to provide the guide for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. METHOD: A retrospective review was performed and a total of 112 cases of neonatal purulent meningitis (male 64, female 58) were identified in the neonatal intensive care unit of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University seen from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2013. The clinical information including pathogenic bacterial distribution, drug sensitivity, head imageology and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. Numeration data were shown in ratio and chi square test was applied for group comparison. RESULT: Among 112 cases, 46 were admitted from 2004 to 2008 and 66 from 2009 to 2013, 23 patients were preterm and 89 were term, 20 were early onset (occurring within 3 days of life) and 92 were late onset meningitis (occurring after 3 days of life). In 62 (55.4%) cases the pathogens were Gram-positive bacteria and in 50 (44.6%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The five most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (32 cases, 28.6%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS, 20 cases, 17.9%), Streptococcus (18 cases, 16.1%, Streptococcus agalactiae 15 cases), Enterococci (13 cases, 11.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases, 8.0%). Comparison of pathogenic bacterial distribution between 2004-2008 and 2009-2013 showed that Gram-positive bacteria accounted for more than 50% in both period. Escherichia coli was the most common bacterium, followed by Streptococcus in last five years which was higher than the first five years (22.7% (15/66) vs. 6.5% (3/46), chi(2) = 5.278, P < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was more common isolate in preterm infants than in term infants (13.0% (3/23) vs. 1.1% (1/89), chi(2) = 7.540, P < 0.05). Streptococcus (most were Streptococcus agalactiae) was the most common bacteria in early onset meningitis and higher than those in late onset meningitis (35.0% (7/20) vs. 12.0% (11/92), chi(2) = 4.872, P < 0.05). Drug sensitivity tests showed that all the Gram-positive bacterial isolates were sensitive to linezolid. Staphylococci were resistant to penicillin, and most of them were resistant to erythromycin, oxacillin and cefazolin; 77.8%of CNS isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus. No Streptococcus and Enterococcus faecalis was resistant to penicillin. None of enterococci was resistant to vancomycin. Among the Gram-negative bacterial isolates, more than 40% of Escherichia coli were resistant to commonly used cephalosporins such as cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, and all of them were sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone sulbactam and imipenem. Isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were all resistant to ampicillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime, but none of them was resistant to piperacillin tazobactam and imipenem. Of the 112 patients, 69 were cured, 23 improved, 9 uncured and 11 died. There were 47 cases (42.0%) with poor prognosis, they had abnormal head imageology, severe complications and some cases died, 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients with meningitis caused by Streptococcus died. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli, CNS and Streptococcus are the predominant pathogens responsible for neonatal purulent meningitis over the past ten years. There were increasing numbers of cases with Streptococcus meningitis which are more common in early onset meningitis with adverse outcome, therefore careful attention should be paid in clinic. Linezolid should be used as a new choice in intractable neonatal purulent meningitis cases caused by gram positive bacteria.

AB  - A variety of bacterial species play a major role in appendicitis. Both aerobic and anaerobic gram positive and gram negative bacteria such as, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Citrobacter freundii cause appendicitis. Appendicitis is usually polymicrobial. The case assumes importance because of single aetiological agent i.e. unimicrobial and no predisposing factors are present to cause infection. We report a rare case of appendicitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae in child. This case emphasizes that Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause wide spectrum of disease like appendicitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline tested against bacterial isolates causing respiratory tract and skin and skin structure infections in US medical centers in 2013.
AB  - A total of 4533 isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) and 8446 from skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) were consecutively collected in 149 US medical centers in 2013. Strains were susceptibility tested by broth microdilution method against ceftaroline and numerous comparators. Ceftaroline (MIC50/90, </=0.015/0.12mug/mL) was more potent than ceftriaxone (MIC50/90, </=0.06/1mug/mL) against Streptococcus pneumoniae and highly active against ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible strains (n=201; MIC90, 0.25mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015mug/mL), methicillin-susceptible (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.25mug/mL) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50/90, 1/1mug/mL), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (highest MIC, 0.03mug/mL). Ceftaroline exhibited good activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype isolates of Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli (96.7% susceptible and MIC90 of 0.25mug/mL for both) but limited activity against ESBL phenotype isolates. In summary, ceftaroline exhibited potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates causing CARTI and SSSI in US medical centers.
TI  - Bacterial-resistance among outpatients of county hospitals in China: significant  geographic distinctions and minor differences between central cities.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to survey antibacterial resistance in outpatients of Chinese county hospitals. A total of 31 county hospitals were selected and samples continuously collected from August 2010 to August 2011. Drug sensitivity testing was conducted in a central laboratory. A total of 2946 unique isolates were collected, including 634 strains of Escherichia coli, 606 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 476 Staphylococcus aureus, 308 Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 160 Haemophilus influenzae. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in E. coli (42.3% strains), K. pneumoniae (31.7%), and Proteus mirabilis (39.0%). Ciprofloxacin-resistance was detected in 51.0% of E. coli strains. Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. were sensitive to most antibacterial agents. Less than 8.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were resistant to carbapenem. For S. aureus strains, 15.3% were resistant to methicillin, and some strains of S. pneumoniae showed resistance to penicillin (1.6%), ceftriaxone (13.0%), and erythromycin (96.4%). beta-lactamase was produced by 96.5% of Moraxella catarrhalis strains, and 36.2% of H. influenzae isolates were resistant to ampicillin. Azithromycin-resistant H. influenzae, imipenem-resistant but meropenem-sensitive Proteus, and ceftriaxone- and carbapenem non-sensitive M. catarrhalis were recorded. In conclusion, cephalosporin- and quinolone-resistant strains of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumonia and macrolide-resistant Gram-positive cocci were relatively prominent in county hospitals. The antibacterial resistance profiles of isolates from different geographical locations varied significantly, with proportions in county hospitals lower than those in their tertiary counterparts in the central cities, although the difference is diminishing.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis to evaluate ceftaroline fosamil dosing regimens for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin-structure infections in patients with normal and impaired renal function.
AB  - In this study, the probability of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment (PTA) of ceftaroline against clinical isolates causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI) in Europe was evaluated. Three dosing regimens were assessed: 600 mg every 12 h (q12 h) as a 1-h infusion (standard dose) or 600 mg every 8 h (q8 h) as a 2-h infusion in virtual patients with normal renal function; and 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic and microbiological data were obtained from the literature. The PTA and the cumulative fraction of response (CFR) were calculated by Monte Carlo simulation. In patients with normal renal function, the ceftaroline standard dose (600 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion) can be sufficient to treat CABP due to ceftazidime-susceptible (CAZ-S) Escherichia coli, CAZ-S Klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (CFR>90%). However, against meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), the CFR was 72%. In cSSSI, the CFR was also <80% for MRSA. Administration of ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion or 400 mg q12 h as a 1-h infusion in patients with moderate renal insufficiency provided a high probability of treatment success (CFR ca. 100%) for most micro-organisms causing CABP and cSSSI, including MRSA and penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae. These results suggest that in patients with normal renal function, ceftaroline 600 mg q8 h as a 2-h infusion may be a better option than the standard dose, especially if the MRSA rate is high.
TI  - A longitudinal assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among important pathogens collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) in France between 2004 and 2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically important Gram-positive and -negative isolates were collected from patients in France between 2004 and 2012 as a part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial. METHODS: MICs were determined using methodology described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: In total, 17,135 isolates were contributed by 29 medical centres; respiratory (25.1%) and cardiovascular (20.3%) sources predominated. High susceptibility was observed among Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) to linezolid (100%), tigecycline (>/=99.8%) and vancomycin (>/=94.6%). The percentage of MRSA decreased from 34.3% in 2004 to 20.0% in 2009 before increasing to 34.7% in 2012. Vancomycin, linezolid, levofloxacin and carbapenems were highly active (>/=99.6%) against Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3.2% were PRSP. Escherichia coli showed peak susceptibility to the carbapenems (>/=99.9%), tigecycline (99.3%) and amikacin (97.9%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in susceptibility were observed for ampicillin, cefepime and ceftriaxone between 2004 and 2012. ESBL production among E. coli increased from 3.0% (2004) to 14.9% (2012). High susceptibility was noted among Haemophilus influenzae to levofloxacin (100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (99.2%), carbapenems (>/=98.7%) and ceftriaxone (98.5%); beta-lactamase production fluctuated with no notable trend between 18.1% (2007) and 27.7% (2011). Klebsiella spp. were highly susceptible to carbapenems (>/=99.6%) and amikacin (>/=96.4%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefepime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline susceptibility were observed among K. pneumoniae between 2004 and 2012. Only imipenem was highly active (96.5% susceptible) against Acinetobacter baumannii. Imipenem and amikacin (87.7% and 87.1% susceptible) were the most active agents against P. aeruginosa; 10.2% of isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin conserved good in vitro activity against most pathogens (according to their spectrum of activity) in France between 2004 and 2012.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis: risk factors, causes, and neurologic complications.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonates are at greater risk for sepsis and meningitis than other ages and in spite of rapid diagnoses of pathogens and treatments, they still contribute to complications and mortality. This study determines risk factors, causes, and neurologic complications of neonatal meningitis in hospitalized neonates. MATERIAL & METHODS: In this descriptive, cross sectional study, we evaluated 415 neonates with sepsis and meningitis admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at our center between 2008 and 2012. The data that was recorded was age, sex, birth weight, prenatal risk factors, clinical features, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and brain sonographic findings and outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty patients had meningitis. Eleven cases (55%) were male. The mean age was 8. 41 days and mean birth weight was 2891.5+/-766 grams. Poor feeding, seizures, and tachypnea were detected in 12 (60%), 11 (55%), and 6 (30%) patients, respectively. Prenatal risk factors were prolonged rupture of membranes, maternal vaginitis, asymptomatic bacteriuria, prematurity, low birth weights, and asphyxia. Four patients had positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures with klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (50%), Enterococcus spp. 1 (25%), and Group B streptococcus 1 (25%) cases, respectively. Two cases had positive blood cultures with klebsiella pneumoniae. Neurologic complications were brain edema, subdural effusion, and brain abscesses with hydrocephaly. One neonate (5%) died. CONCLUSION: Our study provides some information about risk factors, pathogens, and neurologic complications for neonatal meningitis. Prenatal assessments help to diagnose and reduce risk factors of this hazardous disease.
TI  - Flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  - The objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. A total of 545 clinical isolates, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from Peking Union Medical College Hospital in 2013. MICs were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampC genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Flomoxef showed excellent activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. Moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/mL. Flomoxef showed MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/0.5 mug/mL against MSSA, 0.125/0.25 mug/mL against S. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/mL against S. pneumoniae. In conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against ESBL-producing or ESBL-nonproducing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis and was also potent against MSSA, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Aetiology of Acute Lower Respiratory Infections among Children Under Five Years in Accra, Ghana.
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the aetiological agents and clinical presentations associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) among children under five years old at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana. This was a cross-sectional study carried from February to December 2001. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and venous blood specimens obtained from 108 children with features suggestive of ALRI, were cultured and the isolated bacterial organisms were identified biochemically. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were also tested for Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) antigen using a commercial kit (Becton Dickinson Directigen RSV test kit). A multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was also used to detect and characterize RSV using extracted RNA. Socio-demographic and clinical data were also obtained from the study subjects. Bronchopneumonia (55.5%), bronchiolitis (25%), lobar pneumonia (10.2), non-specific ALRI (4.6%), TB, bronchitis and respiratory distress (0.67%) were diagnosed. The prevalence of septicaemia was 10% and bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enteric bacteria, including Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp and Klebsiella spp, were isolated. Out of the 108 cases, 18% tested positive for RSV, with two cases having RSV as the only aetiological pathogen detected. The subtyping analysis of RSV strains by a multiplex RT-PCR showed that subgroups A and B circulated in the season of analysis.
TI  - [A study on the epidemic of pneumonia among children in Ningbo City, Zhejiang province, 2009-2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years old in Ningbo. METHODS: In 2013 February-April, we selected pediatric ward in three hospitals according to stratified cluster random sampling, and from which we collected all 57 556 hospitalized cases in January 2009-December 2012 period of children under 5 years old. A total of 16 740 medical records and bacterial spectrum records of pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia cases among children under 5 years old were described to calculate the proportions of children pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia hospitalized cases accounted for hospitalized children over the same period(referred to as proportions of pneumonia incidence), the detection rate of bacterial pathogens, proportions of bacterial spectrum, and to analyze the characteristics and bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years. RESULTS: The proportions of children pneumonia in 2009-2012 were 26.16% (2 882/11 017), 31.23% (4 004/12 819), 29.35% (4 898/16 689) and 29.10% (4 956/17 031)(Z = 3.13, P < 0.01), and were in a downward trend by the increasing of age(Z = -113.74, P < 0.01). The proportions of children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 50.71% (6 756/13 318), 26.60% (3 159/11 877), 24.17% (2 574 /10 648), 22.36% (2 509 /11 223) and 16.63% (1 745 /10 490). The proportions of children pneumonia with different season were 26.90% (3 725/13 850), 26.51% (3 788/14 287), 29.59% (4 442/15 011) and 33.21% (4 785 /14 408) (chi(2) = 198.77, P < 0.01). The proportions of severe children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 1.10% (74/6 753), 0.47% (15/3 159), 0.19% (5 /2 574),0.08% (2 /2 509) and 0.06% (1 /1 745), with a downward trend by the age(F = 57.62, P < 0.01). The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was 19.3% (540/2 805), 16.4% (460/2 805), 13.6% (381/2 805), 11.9% (335/2 805), 11.5% (323/2 805) and 6.8% (192/2 805). CONCLUSION: In 2009-2012, the proportions of children pneumonia under 5 year old constituted a relatively high proportion in Ningbo city. Children under 1 year old were the major suffering group of pneumonia and severe pneumonia, which should be the key prevention group. The major bacterial pathogens of children's pneumonia in Ningbo are gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Solanum trilobatum fruits extract and its antibacterial, cytotoxic activity against human breast cancer cell line MCF 7.
AB  - In the present study, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles by a simple and eco-friendly method using unripe fruits of Solanum trilobatum. The aqueous silver ions when exposed to unripe fruits extract were reduced and stabilized over long time resulting in biosynthesis of surface functionalized silver nanoparticles. The bio-reduced silver nanoparticles were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). These biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles were tested for its antibacterial activity against few human pathogenic bacteria including Gram-positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. In addition, we also demonstrated anticancer activity of these nanoparticles in vitro against human breast cancer cell line (MCF 7) using MTT, nuclear morphology assay, Western blot and RT-PCR expression. These results taken together show the potential applications of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using S. trilobatum fruits.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - [Epidemiological investigation on respiratory diseases in 1 300 children, in Jinan, Shandong].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of respiratory diseases and to provide  scientific basis for developing relevant control measures. METHODS: 1 300 children with respiratory diseases were treated in hospitals, from Jan. 2013 to May 2014, in the city of Jinan. Characteristics of respiratory diseases were analyzed. RESULTS: The distribution of respiratory diseases in children appeared as: 373 cases of pneumonia (28.7%), 3 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis (0.2%), 467 cases of acute bronchitis (35.9%), 102 cases of asthma (7.8%), and 355 cases of upper respiratory tract infection (27.3%). The upper respiratory tract infection contained 168 cases of tonsillitis (12.9%), 91 cases of pharyngitis (7.0%), 52 cases of laryngitis(4.0%)and 44 cases of iaryngopharyngitis (3.4%). The age distribution of cases with children respiratory diseases appeared as:71 cases <1 years old (5.5%), 385 cases as 1-2 years old (29.6%), 534 cases as 3-6 years old (41.1%), 258 cases as 7-12 years old (19.8%)and 52 cases as >13 years old (4.0%). The seasonal distribution of children respiratory diseases appeared as:364 cases in Spring (28.0% ), 163 cases in summer (12.5%), 315 cases in autumn (24.2%)and 458 cases in winter (35.2%). Regional distribution of children respiratory diseases appeared as:516 cases in urban area (39.7%), 225 cases in suburb (17.3%), 376 cases in townships (28.9%)and 183 in villages (14.1%). 725 strains were isolated and identified that containing 349 strains(48.1%) of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 136 strains (18.8%) of Haemophilus influenza, 103 strains (14.2% ) of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 82 strains (11.3% ) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 38 strains (5.2%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, 35 strains(4.8%) of Enterobacter cloacae, 22 strains (3.0%) of Streptococcus pyogenes, 17 strains (2.3%) of Alcaligenes, 16 strains (2.2% of Candida albicans)and 9 strains (1.2%) of Flavobacterium indologenes. 1 288 cases (99.1%) were cured. CONCLUSION: The common respiratory diseases would include bronchiolitis, pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections in children, mostly attacking 3-6 year-olds at preschool stage, with spring, winter, urban and township as the prevalent seasons and areas.
TI  - Enhanced Mucosal Antibody Production and Protection against Respiratory Infections Following an Orally Administered Bacterial Extract.
AB  - Secondary bacterial infections following influenza infection are a pressing problem facing respiratory medicine. Although antibiotic treatment has been highly successful over recent decades, fatalities due to secondary bacterial infections remain one of the leading causes of death associated with influenza. We have assessed whether administration of a bacterial extract alone is sufficient to potentiate immune responses and protect against primary infection with influenza, and secondary infections with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella pneumoniae in mice. We show that oral administration with the bacterial extract, OM-85, leads to a maturation of dendritic cells and B-cells characterized by increases in MHC II, CD86, and CD40, and a reduction in ICOSL. Improved immune responsiveness against influenza virus reduced the threshold of susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, and thus protected the mice. The protection was associated with enhanced polyclonal B-cell activation and release of antibodies that were effective at neutralizing the virus. Taken together, these data show that oral administration of bacterial extracts provides sufficient mucosal immune stimulation to protect mice against a respiratory tract viral infection and associated sequelae.
TI  - Novel phospholipase A2 inhibitors from python serum are potent peptide antibiotics.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a vital role in defense against resistant bacteria. In this study, eight different AMPs synthesized from Python reticulatus serum protein were tested for bactericidal activity against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW and TES strains), and Proteus vulgaris) using a disc-diffusion method (20 mug/disc). Among the tested peptides, phospholipase A2 inhibitory peptide (PIP)-18[59-76], beta-Asp65-PIP[59-67], D-Ala66-PNT.II, and D60,65E-PIP[59-67] displayed the most potent bactericidal activity against all tested pathogens in a dose-dependent manner (100-6.8 mug/ml), with a remarkable activity noted against S. aureus at 6.8 mug/ml dose within 6 h of incubation. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) by a micro-broth dilution method at 100-3.125 mug/ml revealed that PIP-18[59-76], beta-Asp65-PIP[59-67] and D-Ala66-PNT.II peptides exerted a potent inhibitory effect against S. aureus and B. pseudomallei (KHW) (MICs 3.125 mug/ml), while a much less inhibitory potency (MICs 12.5 mug/ml) was noted for beta-Asp65-PIP[59-67] and D-Ala66-PNT.II peptides against B. pseudomallei (TES). Higher doses of peptides had no effect on the other two strains (i.e., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Overall, PIP-18[59-76] possessed higher antimicrobial activity than that of chloramphenicol (CHL), ceftazidime (CF) and streptomycin (ST) (30 mug/disc). When the two most active peptides, PIP-18[59-76] and beta-Asp65-PIP[59-67], were applied topically at a 150 mg/kg dose for testing wound healing activity in a mouse model of S. aureus infection, the former accelerates faster wound healing than the latter peptide at 14 days post-treatment. The western blot data suggest that the topical application of peptides (PIP-18[59-67] and beta-Asp65-PIP[59-67]) modulates NF-kB mediated wound repair in mice with relatively little haemolytic (100-1.56 mug/ml) and cytotoxic (1000-3.125 mug/ml) effects evident on human cells in vitro.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - A recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin recognizes specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns of bacteria through rhamnose.
AB  - Horseshoe crab is an ancient marine arthropod that, in the absence of a vertebrate-like immune system, relies solely on innate immune responses by defense molecules found in hemolymph plasma and granular hemocytes for host defense. A plasma lectin isolated from the hemolymph of Taiwanese Tachypleus tridentatus recognizes bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), yet its structure and mechanism of action remain unclear, largely because of limited availability of horseshoe crabs and the lack of a heterogeneous expression system. In this study, we have successfully expressed and purified a soluble and functional recombinant horseshoe crab plasma lectin (rHPL) in an Escherichia coli system. Interestingly, rHPL bound not only to bacteria and LPSs like the native HPL but also to selective medically important pathogens isolated from clinical specimens, such as Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. The binding was demonstrated to occur through a specific molecular interaction with rhamnose in pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the bacterial surface. Additionally, rHPL inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The results suggest that a specific protein-glycan interaction between rHPL and rhamnosyl residue may further facilitate development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for microbial pathogens.
TI  - Changing bacteriological profile and mortality trends in community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - There are very few and conflicting Indian data regarding the bacteriological etiology of community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Adding to this agony, there is no credible data from the eastern part of India. This is a cross-sectional study and descriptive in nature over a period of 1-year. Of the 464 cases of the study population, we could isolate aerobic bacteria in 149 patients (32.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae has been identified as the most common organism causing CAP (68/149). Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) as a group exceeded marginally over S. pneumoniae (69/149). Among GNB, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common organism (31/69), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (29/69). Staphylococcus aureus was identified in (12/149) cases. Co-amoxyclav is still the most sensitive drug for S. pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa was most sensitive to imipenam followed by piperacillin-tazobactam.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial analysis of aqueous humor after topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of aqueous humor in patients who had preoperative topical application of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5%. SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Santa Casa de Misericordia de Sao Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Twenty-nine eyes from 29 cataract surgery patients were included in this study. In the study group (n = 15 eyes), 3 topical applications of moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% were administered preoperatively; in the control group (n = 14 eyes), no topical applications were administered. Aqueous humor samples were collected and stored in sterile microtubes at -80 degrees C until analysis. Antimicrobial analysis was performed using standard strains with standard sterile filter paper disks. Inhibition halos were measured in millimeters, and both bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: Inhibition halos were observed on most of the study group plates except those with Streptococcus pneumoniae: Escherichia coli (13.93 mm +/- 0.64 [SD]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.63 +/- 0.61 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (7.47 +/- 0.68 mm), and S epidermidis (4.20 +/- 3.33 mm) The differences between the mean inhibition halo diameters were statistically significant (P < .0001) in all samples. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms studied. CONCLUSIONS: After topical application of moxifloxacin 0.5%, aqueous humor showed bacteriostatic effect against E coli, K pneumoniae, S aureus, and S epidermidis. No bactericidal effect was observed against any of the microorganisms evaluated. No antimicrobial effect against S pneumoniae was observed. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE: No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.
TI  - Prevalence of community-acquired bacteraemia in Guinea-Bissau: an observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of bloodstream infections is insufficiently studied in children in Africa and many healthcare facilities lack the capacity to identify invasive disease. Often studies have been limited to febrile patients or patients admitted to hospital. METHODS: Blood cultures and malaria diagnostics was performed on 372 consecutive children presenting with tachycardia and/or fever to a referral paediatric emergency department in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Bacterial species detection, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular typing were performed. The capacity of clinical parameters to identify bacteraemia was evaluated. RESULTS: The prevalence of bloodstream infection was 12% (46/372) and in 46% (21/46) of the infections the child was non-febrile at presentation to the hospital. The predictive value for bacteraemia was poor for all assessed clinical parameters. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 54% (26/48) of the isolates followed by non-typhoidal Salmonella, 10% (5/48), Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8% (4/48), and Salmonella Typhi, 6% (3/48). Among S. aureus there was a large diversity of spa types and 38% produced Pantone-Valentine leukocidin. Antibiotic resistance was low, however two out of three Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Malaria was laboratory confirmed in only 5% of the children but 64% (237/372) received a clinical malaria diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteraemia was common irrespective of the presence of fever among children presenting to the hospital. The high prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus may be due to contamination. There is an imminent need to improve microbiological diagnostic facilities and to identify algorithms that can identify children at risk of bloodstream infections in Africa.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mode of action of the Artemisia capillaris essential oil and its constituents against respiratory tract infection-causing pathogens.
AB  - Inhalation therapy using essential oils has been used to treat acute and chronic  sinusitis and bronchitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the chemical composition of the essential oil of Artemisia capillaris, and evaluate the antibacterial effects of the essential oil and its main components, against common clinically relevant respiratory bacterial pathogens. Gas chromatography and gas chromatographymass spectrometry revealed the presence of 25 chemical constituents, the main constituents being: alphapinene, betapinene, limonene, 1,8cineole, piperitone, betacaryophyllene and capillin. The antibacterial activities of the essential oil, and its major constituents, were evaluated against Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MRSA (clinical strain), methicillingentamicin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MGRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. The essential oil and its constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. The essential oil was observed to be much more potent, as compared with any of its major chemical constituents, exhibiting low minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentration values against all of the bacterial strains. The essential oil was most active against S. pyogenes, MRSA (clinical strain), S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and E. coli. Piperitone and capillin were the most potent growth inhibitors, among the major chemical constituents. Furthermore, the essential oil of A. capillaris induced significant and dosedependent morphological changes in the S. aureus bacterial strain, killing >90% of the bacteria when administered at a higher dose; as determined by scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the essential oil induced a significant leakage of potassium and phosphate ions from the S. aureus bacterial cultures. These results indicate that the antibacterial action of A. capillaris essential oil may be mediated through the leakage of these two important ions. In conclusion, A. capillaris essential oil exhibits potent antibacterial activity by inducing morphological changes and leakage of ions in S. aureus bacterial cultures.
TI  - Correlation between imaging characteristics and microbiology in patients with deep neck infections: a retrospective review of one hundred sixty-one cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study reviews our recent experience with deep neck infections in order to propose recommendations in selecting presumptive antibiotics according to imaging characteristics and identifying predisposing factors of life-threatening complications. METHODS: The records of 161 patients treated for deep neck infections at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, China Medical University Hospital from 2002 to 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. The demographic data, comorbidities, source of infections, complications, duration of hospital stay, imaging characteristics, and bacteriologic studies were evaluated. The involved neck space was determined by computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast. Complications included mortality and life-threatening conditions. RESULTS: The most common cause of deep neck infections in our study was odontogenic infection (20.5%), followed by pharyngo-tonsillitis (18.6%), and lymphadenitis (10.5%). The most commonly involved neck space was the submandibular space (40.9%), followed by the carotid space (37.2%), and the para-pharyngeal space (33.5%). Gas formation was detected in 31 (19.3%) cases. Infections of the different neck spaces and patients with gas formation noted on CT scan showed a specific distribution of common microorganisms. Streptococcus spp. was the most common pathogen in submandibular/sublingual space infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae infection accounted for 53.1% of peri-tonsillar/para-pharyngeal space infections, and 40% of carotid space infections. When gas formation was noted on CT imaging, anaerobic infection was the most common pathogen. Chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus (DM), multiple space infection, and gas formation present on CT scan were independent predictors of complications (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The imaging characteristics and microbiology of patients with deep neck infections are correlated and can facilitate the optimal selection of antibiotics. We can administer more precise presumptive antibiotics according to the identified involved neck space on CT scan. Patients with predisposing factors of life-threatening complications require early aggressive multi-disciplinary management to prevent severe sequelae.
TI  - Timing of positive blood samples does not differentiate pathogens causing healthcare-associated from community-acquired bloodstream infections in children in England: a linked retrospective cohort study.
AB  - SUMMARY Paediatricians recognize that using the time-dependent community-acquired vs. hospital-acquired bloodstream infection (BSI) dichotomy to guide empirical treatment no longer distinguishes between causative pathogens due to the emergence of healthcare-associated BSIs. However, paediatric epidemiological evidence of the aetiology of BSIs in relation to hospital admission in England is lacking. For 12 common BSI-causing pathogens in England, timing of laboratory reports of positive paediatric (3 months to 5 years) bacterial blood isolates were linked to in-patient hospital data and plotted in relation to hospital admission. The majority (88.6%) of linked pathogens were isolated <2 days after hospital admission, including pathogens widely regarded as hospital acquired: Enterococcus spp. (67.2%) and Klebsiella spp. (88.9%). Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus and Salmonella spp. were unlikely to cause hospital-acquired BSI. Pathogens commonly associated with hospital-acquired BSI are being isolated <2 days after hospital admission alongside pathogens commonly associated with community-acquired BSI. We confirm that timing of blood samples alone does not differentiate between bacterial pathogens. Additional factors including clinical patient characteristics and healthcare contact should be considered to help predict the causative pathogen and guide empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using ethanolic petals extract of Rosa indica and characterization of its antibacterial, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - The present study was aimed at biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using ethanolic extract of rose (Rosa indica) petals and testing their potential antibacterial activity using selective human pathogenic microbes, anticancer activity using human colon adenocarcinoma cancer cell line HCT 15 as well as anti-inflammatory activity using rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The biologically synthesized AgNPs were also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The characterized AgNPs showed an effective antibacterial activity against Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) than Gram positive (Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis) bacteria. MTT assay, analysis of nuclear morphology, mRNA expression of Bcl-2, Bax and protein expression of caspase 3 as well as 9, indicated potential anticancer activity. In addition, green synthesized AgNPs also attenuated cytotoxicity, nuclear morphology and free radical generation (O2(-) and NO) by rat peritoneal macrophages in vitro. The results of our study show the potential green synthesis of silver nanoparticles in mitigating their toxicity while retaining their antibacterial activities.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of novel nicotinic acid hydrazides and their conversion  into N-acetyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles.
AB  - Synthesis of a series of novel N-acylhydrazones of nicotinic acid hydrazides 3a-j via condensation of nicotinic acid hydrazide 1 with the corresponding aldehydes and ketones is described. The series 3a-j was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against two gram negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two gram positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The zone of inhibition was measured using the disk diffusion method, and in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration indicating that compounds 3a and 3e were effective against P. aeruginosa with MICs of 0.220 and 0.195 mug respectively.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Analysis of the bacterial community in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease sputum samples by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Global Initiative defines COPD for chronic obstructive lung disease as an entirely preventable and treatable disease characterized by sputum production, bacterial colonisation, neutrophilic bronchial airway inflammation and poor health status. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that COPD will become the fourth-most common cause of death worldwide, just behind ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and HIV/AIDS, by 2030. The aim of this study was to determine the main structure feature of sputum potentially pathogenic microorganisms in subjects with COPD during the clinical stable state. METHODS: We employed a molecular genetics-based investigation of the bacteria community, including DNA isolation, PCR amplification and DGGE profiling. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with universal primers targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was employed to characterize the overall COPD patient sputum microbiota composition, and some excised gel bands were cloned for sequencing. Real-time PCR was further utilized to quantitatively analyze the subpopulation of microbiota using group-specific primers targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RESULTS: The DGGE profiles of two groups displayed significant differences between COPD and healthy groups (P < 0.05). Real-time PCR revealed significant increases of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05) in the COPD group compared with the healthy group. CONCLUSION: This study revealed strong relationship between alterations of sputum microbiota and COPD. By determining the content of several types of bacteria, we can provide evidence to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of COPD.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potential of Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser - A less explored  Indian mistletoe Growing on Mango Trees.
AB  - Helicanthus elastica (Desr.) Danser (Loranthaceae) is a less-known medicinally important mistletoe species occurring in India. It is used to check abortion, and also in vesical calculi and kidney affections. There are no detailed studies reporting the antimicrobial potential of this plant. Based on the traditional use and the rich phenolic composition of the whole plant, the antimicrobial property of the alcohol extract was analyzed and the results are outlined in the present paper. For the analysis, zone of inhibition, and minimum inhibitory concentration were used, and the total activity was assayed by standard methodologies. The antimicrobial activity was studied against bacteria like Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio fischeri, and a fungus Candida albicans. Of the eight tested bacteria, the alcoholic extract of H. elastica was found to be active against K. pneumoniae, A. hydrophila, E. coli, and V. fischeri at concentration ranging from 250 to 500 mug/ml. C. albicans showed inhibition only at a concentration of 2000 mug/ml.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluation of ceftaroline fosamil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ceftaroline fosamil is a 5th generation cephalosporin with an in vitro spectrum of activity including Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella oxytoca, K. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) in adults. AREAS COVERED: This review covers the mechanism of action; bacterial resistance; pharmacokinetic characteristics in various patient populations; pharmacodynamic data in animal and in vitro models as well as human studies; efficacy observed in clinical trials for ABSSSI and CABP; and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION: Ceftaroline provides in vitro bactericidal activity against methicillin-, vancomycin-, daptomycin-, and linezolid-resistant Gram-positive organisms and select Gram-negative pathogens. The pharmacodynamics of ceftaroline is similar to other beta-lactam agents. Ceftaroline exhibits a favorable adverse effect profile and is generally well tolerated. There is little data on clinical success of ceftaroline in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis other than what has been published in a small series of case reports. Randomized-control studies are needed to establish clinical outcomes and safety in these patient populations.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  - Lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.
TI  - Validation of sputum Gram stain for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The usefulness of sputum Gram stain in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is controversial. There has been no study to evaluate the diagnostic value of this method in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of sputum Gram stain in etiological diagnosis and pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study on hospitalized patients with pneumonia admitted to our hospital from August 2010 to July 2012. Before administering antibiotics on admission, Gram stain was performed and examined by trained physicians immediately after sputum samples were obtained. We analyzed the quality of sputum samples and the diagnostic performance of Gram stain. We also compared pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment guided by sputum Gram stain with empirical treatment. RESULTS: Of 670 patients with pneumonia, 328 were CAP and 342 were HCAP. Sputum samples were obtained from 591 patients, of these 478 samples were good quality. The sensitivity and specificity of sputum Gram stain were 62.5% and 91.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 60.9% and 95.1% for Haemophilus influenzae, 68.2% and 96.1% for Moraxella catarrhalis, 39.5% and 98.2% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 22.2% and 99.8% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9.1% and 100% for Staphylococcus aureus. The diagnostic yield decreased in patients who had received antibiotics or patients with suspected aspiration pneumonia. Pathogen-targeted treatment provided similar efficacy with a decrease in adverse events compared to empirical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sputum Gram stain is highly specific for the etiologic diagnosis and useful in guiding pathogen-targeted antibiotic treatment of CAP and HCAP.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology and antibiotic sensitivity patterns of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized adult patients in Nigeria: a 5-year multicentre retrospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A clear knowledge of the pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in a given region and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns is necessary for optimal treatment. We determined the common bacterial pathogens causing CAP in Nigeria and further reviewed their antibiotic senstivity patterns with a view to providing recommendations to improve antibiotic management of CAP. METHODS: Case notes of all adult patients who were 18 years or more admitted to four major tertiary hospitals in South East Nigeria with a diagnosis of CAP between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively studied. To be eligible, patients were required to have sputum culture and sensitivity results available. Socio-demographic, clinical, pre-admission and in-hospital treatment data were also obtained. RESULTS: Of 400 patients with a radiologically confirmed diagnosis of CAP, 232 fulfilled the study criteria; 122 (52.6%) were women and the mean age was 50.6 +/- 18.8 years. Aetiological agents were identified from sputum in 189 (81.5%) patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 90, 47.6%) was the most frequent isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 62, 32.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 24, 12.7%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 13, 6.9%). The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin (77%), ceftazidime (75.5%) and ofloxacin (55.8%). The susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics most frequently presecribed for empirical therapy was low (co-amoxiclav, 47.6%; ciprofloxacin, 45.9% and ceftriaxone, 47.6%) and this was associated with higher mortality and/or longer duration of hospital stay in survivors. CONCLUSION: Strep. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae were the most common causes of CAP. The pathogens were most sensitive to levofloxacin and ceftazidime. We suggest that these antibiotics should increasingly be considered as superior options for empirical treatment of CAP in Nigeria.
TI  - [Mucosal changes in the periulcer zone and endocrine system in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage].
AB  - Examination of patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage, was conducted, using clinical, microbiological, immunohistochemical methods and chromatomassspectrography. Enhanced activity of inducible NO-synthase, contamination of periulcer zone with microorganisms Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus, enhancement of contents of catecholamines and serotonin in the blood serum were revealed. These changes are most expressed in severe blood loss, unstable local endoscopic hemostasis, high risk of a recurrent hemorrhage occurrence. The data obtained permit to prognosticate severity of a pathologic process course and to improve the treatment programe.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial resistance patterns of acute bacterial meningitis in children: a 10-year referral hospital-based study in northwest iran.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial meningitis is still considered as one of the most dangerous infectious diseases, which causes numerous complications and high mortality if not diagnosed and treated timely. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to determine antimicrobial resistance patterns of bacterial pathogens isolated from acute bacterial meningitis at Tabriz Children Educational-Health Care Center in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study (from 2003 through 2013), all patients with bacterial meningitis were identified by cerebrospinal fluids with positive results in culture (107 cases). Patients' necessary data was recorded in a questionnaire. Furthermore, the results of simultaneous blood culture were also examined. Ultimately, antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates was determined using the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: One hundred and seven patients with bacterial meningitis were identified by cerebrospinal fluids with positive results in culture. All of patients (100%) had fever (male/female = 1.27/1). The most prevalent pathogens isolated from CSF culture were Streptococcus pneumoniae (34.5%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (23.36%), Neisseria meningitidis (6.54%), Serratia spp. (6.54%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.6%), respectively. Moreover, the patients' blood culture had positive results in 36.44% of cases with H. influenzae type b (20.65%) and S. pneumoniae (6.54%) as the main bacteria isolated from blood. Meningitis occurred mostly in children under two years (P = 0.001). According to antimicrobial susceptibility test, a relatively high resistance was reported against some conventional cephalosporins and other antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae type b were the main pathogens of bacterial meningitis in children in the area under study. Most species had relatively high resistance to conventional antibiotics as compared to the past.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against bacterial isolates from pediatric patients: results from the assessing worldwide antimicrobial resistance and evaluation program for the United States (2011-2012).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline, the active form of ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftriaxone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and many Enterobacteriaceae species. Ceftaroline fosamil is approved in the United States for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia in adults. METHODS: A total of 5291 consecutive unique pediatric patient strains of clinical significance were collected from 157 US medical centers. The isolates were identified locally and forwarded to a central monitoring laboratory for reference antimicrobial susceptibility testing. S. pneumoniae isolates from the 2011 to 2012 respiratory season were serotyped. Susceptibility results were analyzed according to patient age as follows: </= 1 years old (yo; 1857 strains); 2-5 (1342); 6-12 (1281) and 13-17 (811). RESULTS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus rates were slightly lower in isolates from patients 13-17 yo (39.9%) compared with other age groups (48.2-51.5%), and ceftaroline was consistently active against S. aureus isolates from all 4 age groups [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC50/90): 0.25-05/1 mug/mL; 99.8-100.0% susceptible]. Overall, 99.8% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were ceftaroline susceptible (MIC50/90: 0.5/1 mug/mL). All S. pneumoniae strains (1178) were ceftaroline susceptible (MIC50/90: </= 0.015/0.12 mug/mL), whereas ceftriaxone susceptibility varied from only 84.8 (</= 1 yo) to 89.7% (13-17 yo). 19A was the most frequent serotype identified among S. pneumoniae and these isolates exhibited low susceptibility to ceftriaxone (42.4%) and most other antimicrobials tested. The highest ceftaroline MIC among Haemophilus influenzae (587 strains) was 0.12 mug/mL (100.0% susceptible), and beta-lactamase production rates varied from 24.2 (13-17 yo) to 30.1% (6-12 yo); 27.9% overall. Ceftaroline was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (556 strains, highest MIC, 0.06 mug/mL). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-phenotype rates among Escherichia coli/Klebsiella spp. were 6.0/5.1, 11.0/11.5, 5.1/8.3 and 11.4/14.7% for the </= 1, 2-5, 6-12 and 13-17 yo age groups, respectively. Ceftaroline exhibited good activity against non-ESBL phenotype strains of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (MIC90: 0.25 mug/mL for both organisms), but had limited activity against ESBL-producing strains. CONCLUSION: Ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity when tested against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-hemolytic streptococci and non-ESBL-phenotype E. coli and Klebsiella spp. strains isolated from pediatric patients, independent of patient age.
TI  - Emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in patients with fournier gangrene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to investigate the bacteriology and associated patterns of antibiotic resistance Fournier gangrene. METHODS: Patients with Fournier's gangrene from 2008 to 2012 were identified from the computerized database in a medical center in southern Taiwan. The medical records of all patients with Fournier's gangrene were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 61 microorganisms, including 60 bacteria and one Candida spp, isolated from clinical wound specimens from 32 patients. The most common isolates obtained were Streptococcus spp. (n=12), Peptoniphilus spp. (n=8), Staphylococcus aureus (n=7), Escherichia coli (n=7), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=7). Among 21 strains of gram-negative bacilli, five (23.8%) were resistant to fluoroquinolones, and three isolates were resistant to ceftriaxone. Two E. coli strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. Four of the seven S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant. Among 15 anaerobic isolates, nine (60%) were resistant to penicillin, and eight (53.3%) were resistant to clindamycin. Four (26.7%) isolates were resistant to metronidazole. The only independent risk factor associated with mortality was inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment (p=0.021). CONCLUSION: Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are emerging in the clinical setting of Fournier gangrene. Clinicians should use broad-spectrum antibiotics initially to cover possible antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Community acquired bacterial pneumonia: aetiology, laboratory detection and antibiotic susceptibility pattern.
AB  - This cross sectional study was conducted to identify the common bacterial causes  of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from sputum and blood by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to evaluate the effectiveness of these tests. A total of 105 sputum and blood samples were collected from patients with pneumonia on clinical suspicion. Common causative bacterial agents of pneumonia were detected by Gram staining, cultures, biochemical tests and PCR. Among 55 sputum culture positive cases, a majority (61.82%) of the patients were in the age group between 21-50 years and the ratio between male and female was 2.5:1. Most (61.90%) of the cases were from the lower socio-economic group. Out of 105 samples, 23 (37.12%) were positive by Gram stain, 29 (27.62%) yielded growth in culture media and 37 (35.24%) were positive by PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common aetiological agent (19.05%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.33%), Haemophilus influenzae (8.57%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.71%). Multiplex PCR is a useful technique for rapid diagnosis of bacterial causes of pneumonia directly from sputum and blood. Considering culture as a gold standard, the sensitivity of PCR was 96.55% and specificity was 88.15%. More than 80% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were found to be sensitive to ampicillin, amoxycillinclavulanate, and ceftriaxone. Susceptibilities to other antimicrobials ranged from 65% for azithromycin to 70% for levofloxacin. On the other hand, the Gram negative organisms were more sensitive to meropenem, ceftriaxone, amoxycillin-clavulanate and amikacin.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological differences between pyriform sinus fistulae in pediatric and non-pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review our 15-year experience with pyriform sinus fistula (PSF) in  a single institution for a better understanding of the disease, pertaining especially to symptom onset at different ages. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for all 21 PSF patients presenting between 1998 and 2012. Patients were then divided into pediatric (</= 15 years old) and non-pediatric (>15 years old) groups according to the age at symptom onset. Clinical and microbiological features of both groups were compared. RESULTS: There were 12 (57.1%) pediatric and 9 (42.9%) non-pediatric patients. It took an average of 13.1 months for the diagnosis of PSF to be confirmed in pediatric patients from the time of symptom onset, whereas the same interval was only 0.7 month in the non-pediatric group. The sensitivity of computed tomography was more than 90% in both age groups, whereas that of barium esophagography was higher in non-pediatric (50.0%) than in pediatric (28.6%) patients. Recurrence occurred after initial treatment in only three patients, all of whom were in the pediatric age group. Bacteriological studies showed that Streptococcus mitis was the most common species isolated from pediatric patients, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common pathogen in the non-pediatric group. CONCLUSION: Non-pediatric PSF with late onset of symptoms is more common than expected or reported in the literature so far. This form of PSF present different clinical and microbiological characteristics compared to pediatric PSF. Therefore, diagnostic and therapeutic counseling for PSF should be tailored according to the age of symptom onset.
TI  - Functional synergy of alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides and traditional antibiotics against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities based on the synergistic effects of traditional antibiotics (imipenem, cefepime, levofloxacin hydrochloride and vancomycin) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs; PL-5, PL-31, PL-32, PL-18, PL-29 and PL-26), alone or in combination, against three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and three Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were investigated. In addition, the antimicrobial activity that was based on the synergistic effects of levofloxacin hydrochloride and PL-5 against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo was explored in a mouse infection model. Traditional antibiotics and AMPs showed significant synergistic effects on the antibacterial activities against the different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in vitro. A strong synergistic effect in the PL-5 and levofloxacin hydrochloride combination against Staphylococcus aureus was observed in the mouse infection model in vivo. The mechanism of synergistic action was due to the different targets of AMPs and traditional antibiotics. The combination of AMPs and traditional antibiotics can dramatically enhance antimicrobial activity and may help prevent or delay the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Thus, this combination therapy could be a promising approach to treat bacterial infections, particularly mixed infections and multi-antibiotic-resistant infections, in the clinics.
TI  - [Surveillance report of drug-resistant bacteria from 2007 to 2012 in Saga Prefecture, Japan (the second report)].
AB  - Drug-resistant bacteria are a problematic issue in Japan. Surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria is important because the frequency of isolation and kinds of such bacteria vary between hospitals and local areas. This study summarizes the results of detection of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture from July 2007 to June 2012. Data presented in this study were collected through questionnaire survey that was conducted in 12 hospitals. Frequency of drug-resistant bacteria are as follows: 62.5% of Staphylococcus aureus was methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA); 62.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP); 26.4% of Haemophilus influenzae was beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR); 0.5% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) P. aeruginosa; 0.5% of P. aeruginosa was multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP); 12.9% and 5.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. While the isolation frequencies of MRSA and PISP/PRSP were unchanged, those of BLNAR, ESBL producing E. coli and ESBL producing K. pneumoniae raised from 15.4% to 34.2%, from 5.7% to 18.4% and from 2.6% to 8.2%, respectively, over the past 5 years. The frequencies of isolation of MDRP and two drug resistant P. aeruginosa declined. This study revealed that the overall trend in the long-term changes of isolation frequency of drug-resistant bacteria in Saga Prefecture is similar to the trend in the national data. It also showed that the frequency and kinds of drug-resistant bacteria are variable between hospitals and local areas. Further study, such as examination of the usage and MIC value of antimicrobial drugs, will enable us to gain more detailed information on the drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Microbiological Profile and Drug Sensitivity Pattern among Community Acquired Pneumonia Patients in Tertiary Care Centre in Mangalore, Coastal Karnataka, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is the most common respiratory tract infection in day to day practice. The knowledge of organism commonly causative of CAP helps in early empirical treatment initiation. AIM: To study the microbiological profile of patients with community acquired pneumonia and to study drug sensitivity pattern. METHODS: Hospital based cross sectional study among 100 patients with CAP was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Southern India. Sputum culture showed that out of 100 patients 39 had an identifiable etiology with 12 patients having evidence of mixed infection. RESULT: Micro-organisms isolated in sputum culture were Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%) followed by, Pseudomonas pyogens (15%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%). AFB smear was found to be positive in 6 patients. Organisms were found to be sensitive for piperacillin plus tazobactum (41%), aminoglycocides (amikacin-46%, gentamicin-31%), third generation cephalosporins (Cefotaxim-36%, Ceftriaxone-18%) and macrolides (Erythromicin-31%, Azithromycin-18%). Sensitivity to chloramphenicol was observed in 31% sputum culture positive patients. Ciprofloxacin sensitivity was seen among 49%. CONCLUSION: Most of the organisms were found to be sensitive to monotherapy with extended spectrum beta lactamases, third generation cephalosporins, fluroquinolones, macrolides.
TI  - Platelet-rich plasma affects bacterial growth in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND AIMS: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP), a blood derivative rich in platelets, is a relatively new technique used in tissue regeneration and engineering. The increased quantity of platelets makes this formulation of considerable value for their role in tissue healing and microbicidal activity. This activity was investigated against five of the most important strains involved in nosocomial infections (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) to understand the prophylactic role of pure (P)-PRP. Microbicidal proteins released from activated P-PRP platelets were also determined. METHODS: The microbicidal activity of P-PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) was evaluated on different concentrations of the five bacterial strains incubated for 1, 2, 4 and 18 h and plated on agar for 18-24 h. P-PRP and PPP-released microbicidal proteins were evaluated by means of multiplex bead-based immunoassays. RESULTS: P-PRP and PPP inhibited bacterial growth for up to 2 h of incubation. The effect of P-PRP was significantly higher than that of PPP, mainly at the low seeding concentrations and/or shorter incubation times, depending on the bacterial strain. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-3, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-5 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand-1 were the molecules mostly related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis inhibition. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were less influenced. CONCLUSIONS: The present results show that P-PRP might supply an early protection against bacterial contaminations during surgical interventions because the inhibitory activity is already evident from the first hour of treatment, which suggests that physiological molecules supplied in loco might be important in the time frame needed for the activation of the innate immune response.
TI  - Clinical characteristics of Q fever and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia  in a tropical region of southern Taiwan: a prospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical characteristics of Q fever are poorly identified in the  tropics. Fever with pneumonia or hepatitis are the dominant presentations of acute Q fever, which exhibits geographic variability. In southern Taiwan, which is located in a tropical region, the role of Q fever in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has never been investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the study period, May 2012 to April 2013, 166 cases of adult CAP and 15 cases of acute Q fever were prospectively investigated. Cultures of clinical specimens, urine antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, and paired serologic assessments for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Q fever (Coxiella burnetii) were used for identifying pathogens associated with CAP. From April 2004 to April 2013 (the pre-study period), 122 cases of acute Q fever were also included retrospectively for analysis. The geographic distribution of Q fever and CAP cases was similar. Q fever cases were identified in warmer seasons and younger ages than CAP. Based on multivariate analysis, male gender, chills, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes were independent characteristics associated with Q fever. In patients with Q fever, 95% and 13.5% of cases presented with hepatitis and pneumonia, respectively. Twelve (7.2%) cases of CAP were seropositive for C. burnetii antibodies, but none of them had acute Q fever. Among CAP cases, 22.9% had a CURB-65 score >==2, and 45.8% had identifiable pathogens. Haemophilus parainfluenzae (14.5%), S. pneumoniae (6.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.0%) were the most common pathogens identified by cultures or urine antigen tests. Moreover, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and co-infection with 2 pathogens accounted for 9.0%, 7.8%, and 1.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In southern Taiwan, Q fever is an endemic disease with hepatitis as the major presentation and is not a common etiology of CAP.
TI  - Increase in the Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Isolates and Ampicillin-Resistant Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Species in Korea: A KONSAR Study Conducted in 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program (KONSAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. Data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to other wards were compared. Intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin G-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VR-EFM) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. Resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of Acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and VR-EFM among ICU isolates was higher than those among non-ICU isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and VR-EFM were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. Resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. The proportion of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA, penicillin G-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. Multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from ICUs. The prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased.
TI  - Subclinical pulmonary pathogenic infection in camels slaughtered in Cairo, Egypt.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Camels migrate between the open boundaries of Sudan and Egypt either for grazing or for slaughtering. Bad hygiene and stress is often related to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections. METHODOLOGY: Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and 100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial identification and histopathology. RESULTS: A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%), Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in 50% of the investigated lungs. CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers and may spread infections to humans.
TI  - [The application of loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of common pathogenic bacteria in lower respiratory tract infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of common pathogenic bacteria of low respiratory tract infection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acid test and to prove the clinical significance of this method. METHODS: A total of 289 qualified sputum samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infections in Fujian Province were detected by LAMP technique, and then the distribution of pathogenic bacteria was analyzed. The positive cases (the patients whose specific bacterial copies in their sputum samples > 1x10(3) copies/ml) were divided into 2 groups according to whether their treatment had covered this pathogen or not. The underlying diseases, duration of anti-bacterial treatment, the hospital days, and the effectiveness of initial treatment and cure rate were compared. RESULTS: The culture method in the 289 patients showed that 44 (15.2%) were positive. Tests by the LAMP method with a bacteria concentration > 1x10(3) copies/ml as cutoff value, showed positive results in 124 patients (43.0%). The lower respiratory tract pathogens included 144 strains of bacteria (77.8%), and 41 strains of atypical pathogens (22.2%). Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 95 cases the initial therapy had covered the pathogens, while in 29 cases the initial therapy had not. The effectiveness of the initial treatment (chi(2) = 31.0, P < 0.01) and the total days of hospital stay (t = -2.083, P = 0.039) in the group whose antibiotics had covered the pathogens were significantly higher than those of the other group. However, there were no significant difference in duration of anti-bacterial treatment (t = -1.073, P = 0.285)and cure rates (chi(2) = 0.6, P = 0.4) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP method can detect the nuclear acid of the bacteria in the sputum much more rapidly and sensitively than the routine culture method. LAMP technique may be helpful to know the pathogenic bacteria before treatment, and therefore may improve the choice of initial antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act. Final rule.
AB  - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. This final rule implements a provision of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) title of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA). GAIN is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. Based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' Acinetobacter species, Aspergillus species, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Campylobacter species, Candida species, Clostridium difficile, Coccidioides species, Cryptococcus species, Enterobacteriaceae (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae), Enterococcus species, Helicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, Non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, Pseudomonas species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. The preamble to the proposed rule described the factors the Agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. As described in the preamble of this final rule, FDA applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.
TI  - Phyllanthus wightianus Mull. Arg.: a potential source for natural antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Phyllanthus wightianus belongs to Euphorbiaceae family having ethnobotanical importance. The present study deals with validating the antimicrobial potential of solvent leaf extracts of P. wightianus. 11 human bacterial pathogens (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens) and 4 fungal pathogens (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Mucor racemosus, and Aspergillus niger) were also challenged with solvent leaf extracts usingagar well and disc diffusion methods. Further, identification of the active component present in the bioactive extract was done using GC-MS analysis. Results show that all extracts exhibited broad spectrum (6-29 mm) of antibacterial activity on most of the tested organisms. The results highlight the fact that the well in agar method was more effective than disc diffusion method. Significant antimicrobial activity was detected in methanol extract against S. pneumoniae (29 mm) with MIC and MBC values of 15.62 mug/mL. GC-MS analysis revealed that 29 bioactive constituents were present in methanolic extract of P. wightianus, of which 9,12-octadecaenioic acid (peak area 22.82%; RT-23.97) and N-hexadecanoic acid (peak area 21.55% RT-21.796) are the major compounds. The findings of this study show that P. wightianus extracts may be used as an anti-infective agent in folklore medicine.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological influence of diabetes mellitus on deep neck infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus has been recognized as the most common systemic disease associated with deep neck infection. We report the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the influence of diabetes on clinical and bacteriological characteristics of deep neck infection. METHODS: Articles were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society database. A critical review of 227 studies identified 20 studies eligible for quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: Diabetes was associated with higher prevalences of multispace spread of infection, complications, and failure to identify pathogenesis, with risk ratios (RRs) of 1.96, 2.42, and 1.29, respectively. Bacteriologically, patients with diabetes showed a higher prevalence of culture identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae (RR, 3.28), and lower prevalences of Streptococcus spp. (RR, 0.57) and anaerobes (RR, 0.54). CONCLUSION: Deep neck infection with diabetes differs from that without in several clinical aspects. Again, bacteriological differences imply that diabetic infections might be populated by different bacterial flora. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2014.
TI  - Studies on Antimicrobial and Immunomodulatory Effects of Hot Aqueous Extract of Acacia nilotica L. Leaves against Common Veterinary Pathogens.
AB  - Acacia nilotica is a plant species that is almost ubiquitously found in different parts of the world. Various preparations of it have been advocated in folk medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, smallpox, dysentery, cough, ophthalmia, toothache, skin cancer as astringent, antispasmodic, and aphrodisiac since immemorial times. The present study investigates the antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunomodulatory potential of hot aqueous extract (HAE) of Acacia nilotica leaves. On dry matter basis, the filtered HAE had a good extraction ratio (33.46%) and was found to have carbohydrates, glycosides, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, saponins, and flavonoids as major constituents. HAE produced dose dependent zone of inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis and fungal pathogens Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigates; however, no antiviral activity was recorded against IBR virus. HAE of A. nilotica revealed both proliferative and inhibitory effects on the rat splenocytes and IL-10 release depending on the dose. Detailed studies involving wide spectrum of bacterial, fungal, and viral species are required to prove or know the exact status of each constituents of the plant extract.
TI  - Colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip test compromising optimised combinations of anti-S. suis capsular polysaccharide polyclonal antibodies for detection of Streptococcus suis.
AB  - A rapid diagnosis kit that detects Streptococcus suis (S. suis) antigens from urine with an immunochromatographic stripe (ICS) test was developed in this study. The ICS test was produced using colloidal gold coated with polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against S. suis. The pAbs were developed from rabbits immunised with S. suis serotype 2 capsular polysaccharides (CPS). Development of the pAbs was investigated to establish their binding to CPS and to determine the maximum sensitivity of two combination antibodies for the ICS test. The results of the ICS optimisation revealed that the combinations of pAb C-N1 and pAb C-N2 had the highest sensitivity to CPS. The minimum limitation of ICS sensitivity indicated 1.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) and a CPS concentration of 0.05 microg. The assay time for detection of S. suis antigens is less than 15 min, which is suitable for rapid detection. A cross-reactive test was also conducted, and it detected no other bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The cross-reactivity of other serotypes in S. suis was also investigated, and tests for serotypes of 1, 1/2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, and 16 were positive. This study presents the first report of a development of an ICS that enables the quantitative detection of streptococcal antigens. The S. suis ICS provides several advantages over other methods, including the speed and simplicity of use.
TI  - Occurrence of urinary tract infection in adolescent and adult women of shanty town in Dhaka City, Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is commonly experienced by women of various age groups especially elderly ones. We planned to find out the prevalent microbial strains causing UTI in slum inhabitant adolescent and adult women in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Urine sample was collected from 462 UTI suspected female subjects. Pathogenic bacteria were identified using standard microbiological tests, and antimicrobial sensitivity profiles of the pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Bacteriuria was present in 9% of the subjects. A higher incidence (16.8%) of UTI was noted among adult women aged above 19 years. Escherichia coli (69%), Streptococcus spp. (15%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%) were more frequently isolated from the urine samples compared to Enterococcus faecalis (3%), Staphylococcus aureus (2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2%) and Hafnia alvei (2%). The E. coli isolates showed complete resistance to commonly used drugs, and 58% of these isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values for ciprofloxacin ranged between 64microg/ml and 512microg/ml, and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) values against the isolates were 128microg/ml or above. Isolated strains of E. coli exhibited equal extent of ciprofloxacin resistance irrespective of the presence or absence of plasmid in them. CONCLUSION: The extent of drug resistance among the uropathogens if ignored may render them uncontrollable. This study suggests regular monitoring of drug resistance phenotype of the UTI pathogens to reduce the morbidity of female UTI patients and offer better treatment strategy in the healthcare sectors of Bangladesh.
TI  - Lung abscess due to Streptococcus pneumoniae: a case series and brief review of the literature.
AB  - Anaerobes used to be the most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess, and Streptococcus species used to be the second most common cause. In recent years, this has been changing. Klebsiella pneumoniae is now an increasing cause of community- acquired lung abscess, but Streptococcus species continue to be major pathogens. Necrotizing pneumonia has generally been regarded as a rare complication of pneumococcal infection in adults. Type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most common type implicated in necrosis; however, many other serotypes were implicated. This entity predominately infects children, but is present also in adults. Lung abscess in adults due to Streptococcus pneumoniae is not common. In this regard we present a case series of pulmonary cavitation due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and discuss the possible pathogenic mechanism of the disease.
TI  - Management of necrotizing pneumonia and pulmonary gangrene: a case series and review of the literature.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing pneumonia is an uncommon but severe complication of bacterial pneumonia, associated with high morbidity and mortality. The availability of current data regarding the management of necrotizing pneumonia is limited to case reports and small retrospective observational cohort studies. Consequently, appropriate management for these patients remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To describe five cases and review the available literature to help guide management of necrotizing pneumonia. METHODS: Cases involving five adults with respiratory failure due to necrotizing pneumonia admitted to a tertiary care centre and infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=1) were reviewed. All available literature was reviewed and encompassed case reports and retrospective reviews dating from 1975 to the present. RESULTS: All five patients received aggressive medical management and consultation by thoracic surgery. Three patients underwent surgical procedures to debride necrotic lung parenchyma. Two of the five patients died in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing pneumonia often leads to pulmonary gangrene. Computed tomography of the thorax with contrast is recommended to evaluate the pulmonary vascular supply. Further study is necessary to determine whether surgical intervention, in the absence of pulmonary gangrene, results in better outcomes.
TI  - Bacterial isolates associated with pelvic inflammatory disease among female patients attending some hospitals in abuja, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to any infection in the female lower reproductive tract that spreads to the upper reproductive tract. The disease comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of the upper female genital tract, including any combination of endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess and pelvic peritonitis. PID is not a notifiable disease in most countries, so accurate statistics are not available. This situation is not in any way different here in Nigeria and more so in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja where this research was conducted, there had never been any published report so far on PID. It therefore became pertinent that such studies be carried out to evaluate the bacterial organisms which may be associated with the disease in this part of Nigeria so that health care providers could take a better look at this affliction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endocervical swabs totalling 100 were aseptically collected from patients with confirmed Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), attending some hospitals in Abuja, Nigeria for detection of bacterial pathogens based on cultural and biochemical characterisation tests. Antibiogram was also conducted on the identified bacterial isolates. RESULTS: Out of the 100 samples analysed, 43% yielded pure cultures of bacterial isolates, 2% yielded mixed cultures while no bacterial growths were recorded from the remaining 55% samples. Organisms encountered were Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (10%), Streptococcus faecalis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Proteus rettgeri (2%) and Proteus mirabilis (1%). The highest percentage occurrence of pathogenic isolates was observed in polygamous married patients (90%). The age group most affected falls within the mean age 30.5 years (68%) while the least affected group falls within the mean age 40.5 years (5%). There was a significant difference in the acquisition of PID in relation to marital status (P < 0.05). However there was no significant difference in the acquisition of the disease with respect to age (P > 0.05). Antibiogram patterns of pathogenic isolates revealed varied resistance to most of the antibiotics employed. Cefotaxime (a new generation cephalosporin antibiotic) was established in this study as the best antimicrobial agent for treatment of PID due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the women examined. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Pelvic inflammatory disease is a major health problem in developed or developing countries of the world. PID is not a notifiable disease, as accurate statistics on disease prevalence are rarely available. There is therefore no doubt thousands of young women have salpingitis every year and their sheer number makes it an important health problem. PID hence can be said to be a very serious complication of sexually transmitted disease which should be critically and promptly handled by healthcare providers. The right type sample should be aseptically collected and be appropriately handled for laboratory investigation. Treatment of PID should be initiated as soon as the presumptive diagnosis has been made. Immediate administration of antibiotics has been effective in the long-term sequelae associated with PID, especially new generation antibiotics, such as cefotaxime as recorded in this study.
TI  - Contemporary use of ceftaroline fosamil for the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: CAPTURE study experience.
AB  - The Clinical Assessment Program and Teflaro((R)) Utilization Registry (CAPTURE) is a multicenter cohort study designed to collect information on the contemporary use of ceftaroline fosamil in the US. Data collected from 398 evaluable patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) (mean age 64 years) during the first 18 months of the study are presented. Most patients had co-morbidities (76%; primarily structural lung disease), and >==2 signs and symptoms of CABP (76%). Overall clinical success was 79% which varied little with ceftaroline fosamil usage (monotherapy vs concurrent therapy; first-line vs second-line therapy). Most patients were discharged home (60%) or to another healthcare facility (35%). These data suggest that ceftaroline, in contemporary clinical use, is an effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with CABP, including those with significant co-morbidities or who required a change of their prior antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2006)].
AB  - From October 2006 to September 2007, we collected the specimen from 356 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 14 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 414 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 407 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 64, Streptococcus pneumoniae 96, Haemophilus influenzae 87, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 52, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 20, and Moraxella catarrhalis 44. Of 64 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 27 (42.2%) and 37 (57.8%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, vancomycin and linezolid showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Imipenem and faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (45.8%) and clindamycin (20.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), tobramycin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (50.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 49.2% and 28.1% of all the respiratory infections, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (29.2%), S. aureus (20.8%), and H. influenzae (12.9%). H. influenzae (25.0%) and P. aeruginosa (21.7%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the antibacterial agent administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (27.5%) and H. influenzae (22.5%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides was P. aeruginosa, and its isolation frequently was 39.4%.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible CA-BSIs and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with CA-BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of Manhattan in New York, NY, from 2006 to 2008. The CA-BSIs present at hospital admission were defined as BSIs occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. Infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. RESULTS: In total, 1677 CA-BSIs were identified. Staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). Significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted Charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for S. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for S. pneumoniae (p=0.02). Urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). CONCLUSION: Over 27% of the CA-BSIs present on admission were antibiotic resistant. Understanding the prevalence and risk factors for CA-BSIs may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.
TI  - Etiologies and resistance profiles of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia in Cambodian and neighboring countries' health care settings: a systematic review (1995 to 2012).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Etiological data for Cambodia is scarce. We aimed to describe the main etiological agents causing CAP, and their resistance patterns in Cambodia and the greater Mekong region. METHODS: A review of bacterial etiologies of CAP and antimicrobial resistance in Cambodia and neighboring countries was conducted via: (1) a systematic review of published literature in all NCBI databases using Pubmed, Google scholar, EMBASE, the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Ministry of Health libraries; (2) a review of unpublished data from Cambodia provided by national and international stakeholders working at different tiers of the healthcare system. RESULTS: Twenty three articles and five data sources reported etiologies for 5919 CAP patients diagnosed between May 1995 and December 2012, including 1421 (24.0%), 3571 (60.3%) and 927 (15.7%) from Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most common pathogens ranking among the five most prevalent in 12 and 10 studies, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria such as Burkholderia pseudomallei and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also frequently diagnosed, particularly in bacteremic CAP in Thai adults and Cambodian children. In Thailand and Vietnam, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were frequently identified in settings using indirect laboratory testing. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, CAP data in Cambodia seems to present etiological and resistance profiles comparable to those of neighboring countries. Findings have been shared with the national authorities upon the revision of the national therapeutic guidelines and were disseminated using a specially created website.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against organisms isolated from respiratory tract infections in USA hospitals: results from the AWARE Program, 2009-2011.
AB  - The Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program monitors the  activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against pathogens causing either respiratory or skin and soft tissue infections. A total of 7733 isolates from patients in 80 medical centers across the United States (USA) identified as respiratory tract pathogens by the infection type and/or specimen site recorded by the submitting laboratory during 2009-2011 were evaluated. There were 3360 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1799 Haemophilus influenzae, 1087 Staphylococcus aureus, 678 Moraxella catarrhalis, 459 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 223 Escherichia coli, and 127 Klebsiella oxytoca. Annual penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae ranged from 21.9 to 24.3%. All S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at a ceftaroline MIC of </=0.5 mug/mL with 100.0% of isolates categorized as susceptible. Ceftaroline was 16-fold more active than ceftriaxone and 32-fold more active than amoxicillin-clavulanate against penicillin-resistant pneumococci. Only 49.8% of the penicillin-resistant isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone. There were a total of 1087 S. aureus (48.9% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) isolates, and the yearly MRSA rate ranged from 47.9 to 49.7%. The ceftaroline MIC50/90 for S. aureus was at 0.25/1 mug/mL; 98.2% susceptible and no resistant strains (>/=4 mug/mL). Ceftaroline activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.25 mug/mL, respectively; 100% susceptible) was 2- to 4-fold greater than for MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 96.2% susceptible). The ceftriaxone MIC90 for MSSA was 4 mug/mL. Ceftaroline was active against H. influenzae (MIC50/90 </=0.015/0.03 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and against M. catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was active against non-extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype strains of Enterobacteriaceae but not against ESBL-positive phenotype strains. In summary, ceftaroline was highly active against a large collection of bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with respiratory tract infections in the USA during 2009 through 2011.
TI  - Contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. METHODS: All beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (ICUs), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. The outer surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. RESULTS: For general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%, respectively (p<0.001). Except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all ICUs than in corresponding wards. Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). Special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to Staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), Streptococcus viridans (9.4%), Escherichia coli (11.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). Logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. CONCLUSIONS: Noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. The plastic cover of the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. Additionally, chart contamination is more common in ICUs. These findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. However, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.
TI  - Secretion of a pneumococcal type II secretion system pilus correlates with DNA uptake during transformation.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that successfully adapts to the host environment via an efficient uptake system for free DNA liberated from other organisms in the upper respiratory tract, facilitating immune evasion and drug resistance. Although the initial signaling events leading to pneumococcal competence for DNA transformation and the fate of DNA when it has been taken up have been extensively studied, the actual mechanism by which DNA in the environment may traverse the thick capsular and cell wall layers remains unknown. Here we visualize that induction of competence results in the formation of a native morphologically distinct pilus structure on the bacterial surface. This plaited pilus is encoded by the competence (com)G locus, and, after assembly, it is rapidly released into the surrounding medium. Heterologous pneumococcal pilus expression in Escherichia coli was obtained by replacing the pulE-K putative pilin genes of the Klebsiella oxytoca type II secretion system with the complete comG locus. In the pneumococcus, the coordinated secretion of pili from the cells correlates to DNA transformation. A model for DNA transformation is proposed whereby pilus assembly "drills" a channel across the thick cell wall that becomes transiently open by secretion of the pilus, providing the entry port for exogenous DNA to gain access to DNA receptors associated with the cytoplasmic membrane.
TI  - Oral Microflora: A Comparative Study in HIV and Normal Patients.
AB  - The study was designed to compare the oral microbiota in normal and HIV-infected  individuals. The study tries to establish a significant shift in oral microflora in HIV-infected patients. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed to establish any rise in resistance against the antibiotics. It was a two and half year prospective study conducted in a tertiary care centre. The study group consisted of eighty subjects divided into two groups of control and HIV. The age range for this group was 9-75 years. The mean age in this group was 39.7 years. The male:female ratio was 2.75:1. Tuberculosis was the most common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV infection. The most common commensal micro organism isolated was the Viridans streptococci in 60% followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae in 23.33%. HIV Group: The most common commensal micro organism isolated was the Viridans streptococci in 42%; this was followed by the Micrococci spp. in 22% cases. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 6% of cases. The colony count for Viridans streptococci showed a heavy growth in 55.56% of cases in controls whereas the same in HIV group was 62.5%. Micrococcus spp. was isolated from 11 subjects in HIV group while it was not isolated from the controls. 50% subjects in the HIV group showed a heavy growth of Klebsiella spp. whereas controls showed only moderate and scanty growth. In patients with CD4+ T cell count less than 50 cells/mul we found a heavy colonization of the oral cavity with Micrococcus spp., Acinetobacter and Klebsiella spp. Viridans streptococcus was not isolated in any of the patients with CD4+ T cell count less than 50 cells/mul. As CD4+ T cells counts improved to 51-100 cells/mul Viridans streptococcus colonies returned and 37.5% patients showed a heavy growth. Micrococcus spp. colonies were isolated till the CD4+ T cells improved up to 300 cells/mul. At counts > 300 cells/mul the oral microbiota became comparable to that of the controls. Many of the opportunistic infections in HIV are caused by commensal bacteria which are otherwise harmless in a normal individual. Our study is unique in that such a study of the oral commensals in HIV patients has never been reported. We found an increased colonization of the oral cavity by Micrococcus spp. which is a normal commensal of the skin.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity tested against contemporary Latin American bacterial pathogens (2011).
AB  - A total of 2484 target bacterial pathogens were collected (one per patient episode) from patients in 16 Latin American medical centers located in seven nations during 2011. Isolate identity was confirmed at a coordinating laboratory and susceptibility testing was performed for ceftaroline and comparator agents according to reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 30.0% of isolates were from respiratory tract, 29.4% from skin and skin structure, 21.4% from blood stream, 7.9% from urinary tract and 11.3% from other sites. Ceftaroline was active against Staphylococcus aureus (42.8% MRSA) with 83.6% of the isolates at </= 1 mg/L and all isolates at </= 2 mg/L (MIC5090, 0.25/2mg/L). National MRSA rates ranged from a low of 28.8% in Colombia to a high of 68.1% in Chile. All Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC50/90 values were at </= 0.015/</= 0.015 mg/L for both). All Streptococcus pneumoniae were susceptible to ceftaroline, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Susceptibility to ceftriaxone was at 88.4% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 73.9% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for all S. pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone susceptibility was only at 33.3% (CLSI non-meningitis interpretive criteria) and 0.0% (CLSI meningitis interpretive criteria) for penicillin-intermediate (penicillin MIC, 4 mg/L) strains. All Haemophilus influenzae (29.4% beta-lactamase-positive) isolates were susceptible to ceftaroline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. For the Latin American region, the ESBL-phenotype rate was 37.6% for Escherichia coli and 53.3% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ceftaroline was not active against ESBL-phenotype strains but was active against >90.0% of the non-ESBL-phenotype. The spectrum of activity of ceftaroline against pathogens from Latin America indicates that it merits further study for its potential use in the Latin American region.
TI  - The Most Common Detected Bacteria in Sputum of Patients with the Acute Exacerbation of COPD.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) may be triggered by infection with bacteria or viruses or by environmental pollutants; the cause of about one-third of exacerbations cannot be identified. OBJECTIVE: To determine the most common bacteria in sputum culture of patients with AECOPD hospitalized in Intensive care unit of Clinic for pulmonary disease and TB "Podhrastovi" in the 2012. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of sputum bacterial cultures of patients with AECOPD treated in the Intensive care unit of Clinic for pulmonary disease and TB "Podhrastovi" during 2012 .year. Each patient was required to give two sputum for bacterial examination. Each patient was treated with antibiotics prior to admission in Clinic "Podhrastovi". The results of sputum bacterial culture findings are expressed in absolute number and percentage of examined patients. RESULTS: In 2012, 75 patients with AECOPD were treated in Intensive care unit of Clinic for pulmonary disease and TB"Podhrastovi". 44 (58.66%) of patients had normal -nonpathogenic - usual bacterial flora isolated in sputum cultures, 31 (41.34%) had a pathogen bacteria in sputum culture as follows: 7 had Streptoccocus pneumoniae, 8 had Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one with Acinetobacter baumani) ,4 Escherichia colli, others are one or two cases with other bacteria. CONCLUSION: Bacterial airway infections play a great role in many, but not in all, of cases of AECOPD. So there is the need to do a sputum bacterial culture examination in each patient with AECOPD and with appropriate antibiotics to contribute to curing of them.
TI  - The impact of respiratory tract infections on the nutritional state of children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening, autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by intestinal malabsorption, impaired growth and lung disease. Recurrent pulmonary infections in children with CF are often associated with nutritional deficiencies. AIM: To emphasize the effects of recurrent pulmonary infections on nutritional status in children with CF. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 27 patients diagnosed with CF between 1994 and 2011 in the 3rd Pediatric Clinic of the Iasi "Saint Mary" Children's Hospital. The nutritional status was assessed according to ponderal index (PI), body mass index (BMI), Z score for weight and waist. Correlations between the age of onset of symptoms, age at diagnosis, and frequency of infectious episodes, identified bacterial agents and nutritional status were established. RESULTS: Patients aged between 3 months old and 17 years old with an average of 49.48 months +/- 9.83DS; sex ratio was 1.7:1. The patients were diagnosed late, one month to 112 months (average 41.11 months +/- 9.4DS) from the first symptoms until the moment of diagnosis. The clinical forms of CF in the study group were: predominantly respiratory manifestations in 48.14% of cases, and the mixed type, with both respiratory and digestive symptoms, in 18.52% of cases. Delayed weight and/or height gains were identified in 85.19% of cases. The etiologic agents involved in pulmonary infections were Staphylococus aureus (48.14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.33%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (18.51%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7,40%), Streptococcus pneutmoniae (7.40%), Neisseria sica (7.40%). Pulmonary infections caused by Staphylococus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were more often associated with nutritional status abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: In small children with CF pulmonary infections due to various causative agents cause a slow rate of growth (both weight and height). Good nutrition and adequate early treatment of pulmonary infections are beneficial for the general state of affected children and are very important in maintaining their health.
TI  - Removal of bacteria from stallion semen by colloid centrifugation.
AB  - Bacteria (environmental contaminants and occasionally potential pathogens) are found in most stallion ejaculates and may negatively affect sperm quality during storage. Since the use of antibiotics can lead to the development of resistance, an alternative means of microbial control is desirable. The removal of bacteria from stallion semen using Single Layer Centrifugation through Androcoll-E was investigated. Known doses of cultured bacteria were added to freshly collected ejaculates (15mL aliquots) before processing by Single Layer Centrifugation. The resulting sperm pellets and controls (not processed by Single Layer Centrifugation) were cultured and the bacteria identified. In experiment 1, doses of E. coli from 2x10(2) to 2x10(7) colony forming units were added to aliquots of semen. In experiment 2, Taylorella equigenitalis or a mix of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (approximately 7x10(6), 5x10(6), and 6x10(6)cfu, respectively) were added to 15mL aliquots of semen. In experiment 1, more than 90% of the bacteria were removed where loading doses were >x10(4)cfu/mL. In experiment 2, varying proportions of different bacteria were removed, ranging from 68% for naturally occurring Corynebacterium spp. to >97% for added cultured E. coli. Thus, Single Layer Centrifugation can separate spermatozoa from many, but not all bacteria in stallion ejaculates and could be a useful alternative to adding antibiotics to semen extenders to control bacterial contamination. However, further research is needed to determine the effect of small numbers of bacteria on sperm quality.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in eight US hospitals along the US-Mexico border, 2000-2006.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AR) is a growing problem worldwide and international travel, cross-border migration, and antimicrobial use may contribute to the introduction or emergence of AR. We examined AR rates and trends along the US-Mexico border by analysing microbiology data from eight US hospitals in three states bordering Mexico. Microbiology data were ascertained for the years 2000-2006 and for select healthcare and community pathogens including, three Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae) pathogens and 10 antimicrobial-pathogen combinations. Resistance was highest in S. aureus (oxacillin resistance 45.7%), P. aeruginosa (quinolone resistance 22.3%), and E. coli (quinolone resistance 15.6%); six (60%) of the 10 antimicrobial-pathogen combinations studied had a significantly increasing trend in resistance over the study period. Potential contributing factors in the hospital and community such as infection control practices and antimicrobial use (prescription and non-prescription) should be explored further in the US-Mexico border region.
TI  - Etiology and Anti-microbial Sensitivity of Organisms Causing Community Acquired Pneumonia: A Single Hospital Study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to identify the common etiological pathogens causing community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in our hospital and sensitivity patterns to the common antibiotics used. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was undertaken in a 750 bedded multi-specialty referral hospital in Kerala catering to both urban and semi-urban populations. It is a prospective study of patients who attended the medical out-patient department and those admitted with a clinical diagnosis of CAP, during the year 2009. Data were collected based on detailed patient interview, clinical examination and laboratory investigations. The latter included sputum culture and sensitivity pattern. These were tabulated and percentage incidence of etiological pathogens calculated. The antimicrobial sensitivity pattern was also classified by percentage and expressed as bar diagram. RESULTS: The study showed Streptococcus pneumoniae to be the most common etiological agent for CAP, in our hospital setting. The other organisms isolated in order of frequency were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alpha hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Beta hemolytic streptococci and atypical coli. S. pneumoniae was most sensitive to linezolid, followed by amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), cloxacillin and ceftriaxone. Overall, the common pathogens causing CAP showed highest sensitivity to amikacin, followed by ofloxacin, gentamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate (augmentin), ceftriaxone and linezolid. The least sensitivity rates were shown to amoxicillin and cefoperazone. CONCLUSION: In a hospital setting, empirical management for cases of CAP is not advisable. The present study has shown S. pneumoniae as the most likely pathogen and either linezolid or amikacin as the most likely effective antimicrobial in cases of CAP, in our setting.
TI  - Ceftaroline activity against bacterial organisms isolated from acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections in United States medical centers (2009-2011).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a new cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms, including ceftriaxone-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) in the USA. A total of 6222 isolates were collected from 67 medical centers distributed across all nine USA census regions between 2009 and 2011 and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 99.6% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 0.5/1 mug/mL; 99.1% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, the activity of ceftaroline (MIC50/90, </=0.015/0.03 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) was comparable to that of both penicillin (MIC50/90, </=0.06/</=0.06 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible) and ceftriaxone (MIC50/90, </=0.25/</=0.25 mug/mL; 100.0% susceptible). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/mL). Similar to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, ceftaroline was active against wild-type strains of Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/mL; 94.0% susceptible) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/mL; 96.8% susceptible); however, the ceftaroline activity was compromised among strains with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL for both E. coli and K. pneumoniae). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent activity against a large contemporary collection (6222) of bacterial isolates associated with ABSSSI in the USA.
TI  - HIRA-TAN: a real-time PCR-based system for the rapid identification of causative  agents in pneumonia.
AB  - Identification of the causative pathogen(s) of pneumonia would allow the selection of effective antibiotics and thus reduce the mortality rate and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. To identify such pathogens and to obtain these benefits, it is necessary that a clinical test is rapid, accurate, easily performed, and cost-effective. Here, we devised a PCR-based test, named HIRA-TAN, which is able to discriminate therapeutic targets from commensal organisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae) and to detect foreign organisms (e.g. Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Legionella pneumophila) in the sputum. The utility of this system was validated in a prospective study, using sputum samples from patients with pneumonia. 568 patients were enrolled and the HIRA-TAN assay identified the causative pathogens with an accuracy of 96.7% for H. influenzae; 93.2% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 80.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 90.9% for Moraxella catarrhalis; 87.5% for Escherichia coli; 78.1% for MRSA and 91.6% for S. pneumoniae. Overall the HIRA-TAN procedure was able to identify the causative pathogens of pneumonia in 60% of the cases. Additionally, this procedure was able to determine when the pneumonia-causing organism was a commensal organism or a foreign organism in a single assay. The HIRA-TAN approach yielded reproducible results and provided valuable information to plan the course of treatment of pneumonia. Through the rapid identification of the causative pathogens, the HIRA-TAN will promote targeted treatments for pneumonias. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: UMIN000001694.
TI  - [The frequency of bacteria in human gallstones].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Complications caused by lost gallstones within the abdominal cavity are well known. Abscesses, perforation of the gastro-intestinal tract were all described in the literature, but gallstones were found in hernial sac, or even in sputum after it penetrated through the diaphragm into the respiratory tract. These complications can develop between several weeks to several years postoperatively. Most complications can be treated surgically only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty gallstones and bile samples were collected from 50 patients who underwent cholecystectomy (36 female / 14 male, avarge age: 60.8 +/- 6.8 years). All samples were sent for microbiological examination. RESULTS: bacterial colonization of the gallstone and the bile were found in 16 cases. Four of them showed acute inflammation in the gallbladder while pathological signs of chronic inflammation in the gallbladder wall were detected in eight cases. Empyema was found in four cases. Bacteria from enteral origin (Esherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae) was detected in 13 cases, while non-enteral (Klebsiella penumoniae, Streptococcus alfa-haemoliticus) colony were detected in three cases. Positive bacterial cultures were identified in twelve female and fourmale patients. CONCLUSIONS: Different types of bacteria can be found in the gallstones, which may cause various complications.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Blood cultures in sick children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood cultures (BCs) are frequently performed in sick children. A recent audit of BCs among adult patients documented high rates of contamination by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). OBJECTIVES: To describe BC contamination rates and common pathogenic organisms causing bloodstream infection in children at a tertiary- level children's hospital. METHODS: BC results for children admitted to Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital from 2008 to 2012 were extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service database. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic (contaminated) growth on BCs in children <1 year of age and >1 year of age, were analysed. Data analysis was performed using Epi Info version 3.5.1. RESULTS: A total of 47 677 BCs were performed in the 5-year period. The proportion of contaminated specimens ranged between 5.9% and 7.2% per year (p=0.4). CoNS was the predominant isolate in 53.8% of all contaminated BCs. Children <1 year of age experienced higher contamination rates than children >1 year of age (8.7% v. 4.7%; relative risk 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71 - 1.97). Pathogenic organisms were isolated in 6.2% (95% CI 6.0 - 6.4) of all BC specimens. Among Gram-positive organisms, the proportion of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates declined from 14.3% to 4.7% (p<0.00001), while there was a significant increase in Gram-negative organisms (51.8% - 57.9%; p=0.04) over the 5-year period. Klebsiella pneumoniae, the predominant Enterobacteriaceae isolated, decreased from 45.8% to 31.7% (p=0.004). CONCLUSION: This study identified unacceptably high BC contamination rates, emphasising the importance of collecting BC specimens under sterile conditions.
TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity for clinical isolates from pediatric patients of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1: 14) -outcomes of special drug use investigation on antibacterial activity (annual changes)].
AB  - As a special drug use investigation, we monitored and assessed trends in antibacterial activity of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (1:14) (hereafter, "CVA/AMPC (1:14)") and other antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates from pediatric patients with otitis media or respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis isolated and identified from otorrhea, epipharynx and rhinorrhea of pediatric patients with otitis media, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in five years between 2006-2010 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae and 8 microg/mL for H. influenzae and 0.25-0.5microg/mL for M catarrhalis. The changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae were two times, and no decrease in drug susceptibility was found in the period of the present investigation. In addition, the MIC changes of other antimicrobial agents for these three organisms were approximately two to four times as well. Against organisms isolated and identified from pus, sputum, pharynx, skin and urine of pediatric patients with respiratory, skin, and urinary tract infections, the MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) in four years between 2008-2011 were 1 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae, < or =0.06microg/mL for penicillin susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP) without any change, 0.5-1 microg/mL for penicillin intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) with a twofold change and 1 microg/mL for PRSP with no change. The MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 2-8 microg/mL for S. aureus with a fourfold change, 2 microg/mL for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus without any change, 4-8 microg/mL for H. influenzae with a twofold change. Against beta-lactamase non-producing H. influenzae, MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1:14) were 1 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin susceptible (BLNAS), 8 microg/mL for beta-lactamase negative ampicillin resistant (BLNAR), showing no change. Neither Streptococcus pyogenes or Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrated any change and M. catarrhalis and Escherichia coli showed twofold changes of MIC90s of CVA/AMPC (1: 14). In the present investigation conducted to monitor annual changes in antibacterial activity intended for pediatric patients with otitis media or other infections, there was no significant change in antibacterial activity of CVA/AMPC (1: 14).
TI  - Silver-doped manganese dioxide and trioxide nanoparticles inhibit both gram positive and gram negative pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Palladium, ruthenium and silver-doped MnO2 and silver doped Mn2O3 nanoparticles were synthesized by simple co-precipitation technique. SEM-TEM analysis revealed the nano-size of these synthesized samples. XPS data illustrates that Mn is present in 4+ and 3+ oxidation states in MnO2 and Mn2O3 respectively. Thermal analysis gave significant evidence for the phase changes with increasing temperature. Antibacterial activity of these synthesized nanoparticles on three Gram positive bacterial cultures (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus epidermis ATCC 12228, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633) and three Gram negative cultures (Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella abony NCTC 6017 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 1003) was investigated using a disc diffusion method and live/dead assay. Only Ag-doped MnO2 and Ag-doped Mn2O3 nanoparticles showed antibacterial property against all six-test bacteria but Ag-doped MnO2 was found to be more effective than Ag-doped Mn2O3.
TI  - Susceptibility rates in Latin American nations: report from a regional resistance surveillance program (2011).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a resistance (R) surveillance program monitoring antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in Latin America (LATAM; Argentina [ARG], Brazil [BRA], Chile, Colombia [CBA], Costa Rica, Ecuador [ECU], Guatemala [GUA], Mexico [MEX], Panama [PAN], Peru, and Venezuela [VEN]). METHODS: In 2011, 4979 organisms were collected from 11 nations (20 laboratories) for susceptibility testing in a central laboratory design. Antimicrobials were tested by CLSI methods and results interpreted by CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints. Most common Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus [SA, 921], other staphylococci [CoNS; 299], enterococci [218], Streptococcus pneumoniae [SPN; 182], beta-haemolytic streptococci [115]) and Gram-negative (E. coli [EC; 644], Klebsiella spp. [KSP; 517], Enterobacters [272], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [PSA; 586], Acinetobacters [ACB; 494]) pathogens were analyzed against linezolid (LZD), vancomycin (VAN), tigecycline (TIG), colistin (COL), cefoperazone/sulbactam (C/S), and amikacin (AMK). RESULTS: MRSA rates varied from 29% (CBA, BRA) to 79% (Peru); but LZD (MIC90, 2mg/L), TIG (MIC90, 0.12mg/L) and VAN (MIC90, 1mg/L) covered all strains. Enterococci showed a 14% VRE rate, highest in BRA and MEX; all inhibited by TIG and daptomycin, but not LZD (three non-susceptible with G2576T mutations or cfr). Penicillin-R among SPN and viridans streptococci was 51.6 and 41.1%, respectively. LZD overall R against Gram-positives was 0.3%. High ESBL rates were observed in EC (54-71%) and KSP (>/=50%) from GUA, MEX and Peru, and six nations, respectively. Carbapenem-R in KSP was 9%, highest rates associated with KPC in BRA, CBA, ECU, PAN and VEN; also a NDM-1 in KSP from CBA. AMK, TIG, C/S and carbapenems were the broadest-spectrum agents tested against Enterobacteriaceae. Only COL inhibited >90% of PSA; COL and TIG (</=2mg/L) covered >/=85% of ACB. CONCLUSIONS: LATAM nations demonstrated variable levels of antimicrobial R especially among Enterobacteriaceae (beta-lactamase-mediated), PSA and ACB. MRSA (48%), VRE (14%) and multidrug-R SPN were also regional therapeutic challenges.
TI  - Antibiotic therapy in pyogenic meningitis in paediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate and identify the causative pathogen, antibiotic sensitivity testing and success rate of empirical antibiotic therapy in pyogenic meningitis. STUDY DESIGN: Analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Children's Hospital and Institute of Child Health, Lahore, Pakistan, from March to July 2012. METHODOLOGY: The study was performed on 72 culture positive meningitis cases in children less than 15 years of age. This therapy was evaluated by monitoring the patient's clinical picture for 14 - 21 days. The collected data was analyzed by Chi-square test. RESULTS: Seventeen different bacteria were isolated. The most commonly occurring bacteria were coagulase negative Staphylococci (25%), E. coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.3%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8.3%). All the bacteria were sensitive to vancomycin (96.7%), meropenem (76.7%), amikacin (75%), ciprofloxacin (65.3%), chloramphenicol (46.5%), ceftazidime (44.2%), cefepime (41.9%), co-amoxiclav (38.0%), oxacillin (34.8%), cefotaxime (21.4%), penicillin (20.7%), ceftriaxone (18.6%), cefuroxime (14%) and ampicillin (6.9%). The combination of sulbactam and cefoperazone showed antimicrobial sensitivity of 81.4%. The success rate of empirical antibiotic therapy was 91.7%. CONCLUSION: It was found that Gram negative bacteria were the major cause of pyogenic meningitis. Mostly there were resistant strains against all commonly used antibiotics except vancomycin. All empirical antibiotic therapies were found to be most successful.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess among children in a medical center in Central Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric pyogenic liver abscess is uncommon. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics, radiologic features, pathogens, duration of hospitalization, and management of pediatric pyogenic liver abscess. METHODS: Pediatric patients with pyogenic liver abscess admitted to the China Medical University Hospital from 1995 to 2011 were reviewed. Their clinical characteristics, radiological features, laboratory data, clinical management, and outcomes were analyzed. Those with liver abscess due to the complication of oncologic disease were excluded. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were diagnosed with pyogenic liver abscess. Their most common symptoms were fever and abdominal pain. Eight (53.0%) had leukocytosis (>15000/muL) and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (>10 mg/dL). The main imaging presentation was a single abscess in right lobe of the liver (13/15, 86.7%). Blood culture were mainly negative (12/15, 80.0%). Pathogenic microorganisms cultured from pus revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae (6/15, 40.0%) and Streptococcus spp. (6/15, 40.0%) as the two most common pathogens. Percutaneous abscess drainage followed by adequate parenteral antibiotics were effective interventions. Hospitalization of at least 2 weeks was needed in most cases. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION: Pyogenic liver abscess should be considered in children presenting with fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis with a high CRP level. Most cases involve a single lesion on right lobe of the liver. K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus spp. are the two most common pathogens. Drainage with adequate antibiotics has significantly good response.
TI  - Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial resistance and bacterial spectrum of infection in Gabon, Central Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physicians depend on reliable information on the local epidemiology of infection and antibiotic resistance rates to guide empiric treatment in critically ill patients. As these data are scarce for Central Africa, we performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological findings from a secondary care hospital in Gabon. METHODS: Microbiological reports from 2009 to 2012 were used to assess the non-susceptibility rates of the three most common isolates from six major types of infections (bloodstream, ear-eye-nose-throat, surgical site, skin and soft tissue, urinary tract and wound infection). RESULTS: A high diversity of pathogens was found, but Staphylococcus aureus was predominant in the majority of infections. Overall, the three most prevalent pathogens in children were S. aureus (33.7%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.1%) and Escherichia coli (4.5%) and in adults S. aureus (23.5%), E. coli (15.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.4%). In total, 5.8% (n = 19) of all S. aureus isolates were methicillin resistant. The proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae was 15.4% (n = 78), 49.4% of all K. pneumoniae were ESBL-producer (n = 42). CONCLUSION: The high diversity of potential pathogens and high resistance rates in Gram-negative bacteria challenge a rational empiric use of antibiotics. Countrywide continuous sentinel surveillance is therefore urgently needed.
TI  - Update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across China: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (R) surveillance across Asia and especially in China has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. This 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in China (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). Samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (S) breakpoints. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% MRSA), Escherichia coli (EC; 288), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA; 221), Klebsiella spp. (KSP; 208), acinetobacters (ACB; 178), enterobacters (155), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 154, 46.8% penicillin-S), and enterococci (ENT; 137). Among 849 Gram-positive (GP) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (TIG), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% S). Resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% VISA, 15.4% teicoplanin non-S coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-R ENT (all Enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-R beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-S rates for SPN and viridans group streptococci, respectively. For Gram-negative bacilli, R among Enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in EC and KSP, respectively; carbapenem-R was only 2.1-4.3% with KPC and IMP type enzymes detected in KSP). The widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), TIG (98.6-100%), amikacin (AMK; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% S). PSA was most inhibited by AMK (90.5% S) and colistin (COL; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. Only COL (100% S) and TIG (MIC90, 2 mug/mL) showed significant potencies against ACB. In conclusion, R among pathogens from 12 Chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against GP pathogens, but more serious R problems were noted among Enterobacteriaceae, PSA, and ACB. Combination treatment for the latter multidrug-R strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national surveillance results applying reference methods.
TI  - Nasopharyngeal bacterial colonisation in HIV-positive children in Cambodia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine patterns of nasopharyngeal colonisation in HIV-positive children. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal, nasal and ear swabs were prospectively taken from all children living in two paediatric nursing homes for HIV-positive orphans in Cambodia from 2004 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 882 swabs were taken, of which 586 tested positive for bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated species (178 isolates; 30.4%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (103 isolates; 17.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 isolates; 16.9%). The rate of S. pneumoniae decreased in 2009 when a vaccination programme was introduced. CONCLUSIONS: The respiratory tract of HIV-positive children receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy is commonly colonised by S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, while other species normally found in the respiratory tract, such as Moraxella catarrhalis, are far less frequent.
TI  - Community-acquired, healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired bloodstream infection definitions in children: a systematic review demonstrating inconsistent criteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Historically, bacterial infections were categorized as either community-acquired (CA) or hospital-acquired (HA). However, the CA/HA dichotomy no longer adequately reflects patterns of emerging healthcare-associated (HCA) infections in complex patients managed between hospital and the community. Studies trying to define this evolving epidemiology often excluded children. AIM: To identify what criteria have been used to distinguish between CA, HCA and HA bloodstream infections (BSIs) in children, and the proportional distribution of CA, HCA and HA among total BSIs and by organism. METHODS: We systematically reviewed published literature from PubMed, UK Department of Health and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites. FINDINGS: Results from 23 studies and the websites highlighted the use of inconsistent criteria. There were 13 and 15 criteria variations for CA and HA BSI respectively, although a 48h cut-off for cultures sampled post admission was most commonly reported. Five studies used variable clinical criteria to define HCA. The mean proportion of paediatric CA BSI in nine studies was 50%. Only four BSI organisms from five studies were predominantly CA (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella spp.) or HA (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp.), whereas Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. did not clearly fit into either category. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals inconsistent use of criteria, and a lack of evidence upon which to base them, to distinguish between CA, HCA and HA BSI in children. Criteria for CA, HCA and HA BSI need to be developed using population-based studies that consider patients' clinical characteristics, recent healthcare exposure as well as isolated organism species.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline-avibactam against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals from 2010 to 2012: results from the CANWARD surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline-avibactam, ceftaroline, and comparative agents were determined for a collection of bacterial pathogens frequently isolated from patients seeking care at 15 Canadian hospitals from January 2010 to December 2012. In total, 9,758 isolates were tested by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method (document M07-A9, 2012), with MICs interpreted by using CLSI breakpoints (document M100-S23, 2013). Ceftaroline-avibactam demonstrated potent activity (MIC90, </= 0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Haemophilus influenzae; >99% of isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, C. freundii, and H. influenzae were susceptible to ceftaroline-avibactam according to CLSI MIC interpretative criteria for ceftaroline. Ceftaroline was less active than ceftaroline-avibactam against all species of Enterobacteriaceae tested, with rates of susceptibility ranging from 93.9% (P. mirabilis) to 54.0% (S. marcescens). All isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml) and 99.6% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (MIC90, 1 mug/ml) were susceptible to ceftaroline; the addition of avibactam to ceftaroline did not alter its activity against staphylococci or streptococci. All isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.03 mug/ml), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, </= 0.03 mug/ml), and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC90, 0.015 mug/ml) tested were susceptible to ceftaroline. We conclude that combining avibactam with ceftaroline expanded its spectrum of activity to include most isolates of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and AmpC-producing E. coli and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, while maintaining potent activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - Regional resistance surveillance program results for 12 Asia-Pacific nations (2011).
AB  - The Regional Resistance Surveillance program monitored susceptibility rates and developing resistance by geographic region, including 12 Asia-Pacific (APAC) countries. Reference broth microdilution methods for susceptibility/interpretations were applied, processing 5,053 strains. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates (37% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA], highest in South Korea [73%]), linezolid (LZD), tigecycline (TIG), and vancomycin were 100% active, but 33 and 34% of strains were levofloxacin (LEV) or macrolide resistant, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae was most resistant to beta-lactams and macrolides (45%) but was LZD, LEV, and TIG susceptible (>98%). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype rates in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. were 48 and 47%, respectively, and were highest in Taiwan, at 75 to 91%. The best anti-ESBL-phenotype agents were amikacin (81 to 96% susceptible), colistin (COL; >98%), TIG (>98%), and carbapenems (81 to 97%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed >/=20% resistance to all drugs except COL (99% susceptible). In conclusion, endemic evolving antimicrobial resistances in APAC nations show compromised roles for many commonly used antimicrobials.
TI  - Comparison of eardrum mobility in acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion models.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the eardrum mobility difference between acute otitis media (AOM) and experimental otitis media with effusion (OME). ANIMAL MODELS: Thirty-three Hartley guinea pigs were included in this study. The AOM and OME were created by transbullar injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae and lipopolysaccharide into the middle ear, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three days after inoculation, the morphologic changes of the middle ear were assessed with otoscopy and histologic sections. Vibrations of the tympanic membrane (TM) at umbo in response to pure tone sound were measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. RESULTS: The purulent effusion, ossicular adhesion, and thickened TM and middle ear mucosa were observed in the AOM ears, and the OME ears had serous effusion and less thickened TM and mucosa in the middle ear. The displacement of TM in AOM was lower than that in OME ears, especially at 0.2 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: The TM mobility difference between the AOM and OME ears were mainly caused by the middle ear ossicular structure changes during the bacterial infection in AOM.
TI  - Spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against leading pathogens causing community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infections in Latin America, 2010.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as common Gram-negative organisms. In this study a total of 986 isolates collected in 2010 from patients in 15 medical centers in five Latin American countries from the Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance Evaluation Program were identified as community-acquired respiratory tract or skin and soft tissue infection pathogens. Ceftaroline was the most potent agent tested against S. pneumoniae with a MIC90 value (0.12mug/mL) that was eight-fold lower than ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and linezolid. Its spectrum of coverage (100.0% susceptible) was similar to tigecycline, linezolid, levofloxacin and vancomycin. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, ceftaroline was the most active agent tested. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus (including MRSA) was similar to that of vancomycin and tetracycline (MIC90, 1mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC90, 2mug/mL). The beta-haemolytic streptococci exhibited 100.0% susceptibility to ceftaroline. Ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. was similar to that of ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. These parenteral cephalosporin agents have potent activity against non-extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains, but are not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains. These results confirm the in vitro activity of ceftaroline against pathogens common in community-acquired respiratory tract and skin and soft tissue infection in Latin America, and suggest that ceftaroline fosamil could be an important therapeutic option for these infections.
TI  - Evaluation of post-mortem heart blood culture in a Chinese population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-mortem blood cultures have been used in a wide variety of research studies. However, their significance is still a matter of dispute among medico-legal experts. This study was aimed to determine the factors which influenced post-mortem blood culture results and to assess their value in determining the cause of death. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 76 post-mortem cases with suspected infection and correlated pathological findings with heart blood culture results. RESULTS: We found that survival time after onset of illness was significantly associated with positive heart blood cultures (P=0.014). Blood culture results were not influenced by age, gender, prior antibiotic therapy, interval time from death to store or interval time from death to autopsy (P>0.05). In those who had heart blood cultures taken, 49 cases (64.5%) including four cases with mixed growth, showed positive results, and approximately one-third of blood cultures were sterile. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 77.6% (38/49) including two cases with mixed growth; most were genuine pathogens according to the clinical and pathological findings. However, the negative predictive value (NPV) was 59.3% (16/27). Escherichia coli, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella spp. were isolated most often. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the results of post-mortem heart blood cultures, when combined with clinical and pathological findings, strengthen the understanding of the cause of death.
TI  - Atypical pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia in adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of community-acquired respiratory pathogens with special focus on atypical organisms in patients presenting to a tertiary care facility with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: The descriptive study on adult patients was conducted from February 2007 to March 2008 at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. It comprised 124 consenting patients of age 16 and above who presentd with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. The diagnostic modalities used were based on significant changes in antibody titer or persisting high antibody titers in the case of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chalmydia pneumoniae infections, or bacterial antigen in urine, in the case of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection. Pyogenic bacteria were identified on the results of respiratory secretions or blood cultures. Continuous data and categorical variables were worked out using SPSS version 15. RESULTS: Among the 124 patients enrolled, an etiologic agent was identified in 44 (35.4%) patients. The most common organism was Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 21, 17%), followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 15, 12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 9, 7%), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 2, 1.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2, 1.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1, 0.8%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common organism isolated from blood cultures. No cases of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chalmydia pneumoniae are significant etiologic agents for community-acquired pneumonia occurring in Karachi. Local treatment guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia should include therapy directed specifically at these agents.
TI  - Role of interleukin 1 receptor like 1 (ST2) in gram-negative and gram-positive sepsis in mice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (ST2) has been implicated as a negative regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling. We here sought to elucidate the role of ST2 in cytokine release and systemic infection caused by two common human sepsis pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae (gram-positive) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (gram-negative). METHODS: Whole blood leukocytes and splenocytes were harvested from ST2-deficient (st2) and wild-type (WT) mice and stimulated ex vivo with S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae. In addition, st2 and WT mice were infected intravenously with these bacteria, and bacterial loads and cytokine levels were measured in blood, spleens and lungs at 6, 24, and 48 h thereafter. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, st2 blood leukocytes and splenocytes produced lower levels of cytokines and chemokines than WT cells in response to either pathogen. In contrast, the in vivo role of ST2 during sepsis caused by these bacteria was limited, although at 6 and 24 h after infection with S. pneumoniae bacterial loads were lower in spleens of st2 mice. CONCLUSIONS: ST2 augments rather than inhibits cytokine release by blood leukocytes and splenocytes exposed to S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae, but plays a limited role in host defense during sepsis caused by these pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial diversity in meconium of preterm neonates and evolution of their fecal  microbiota during the first month of life.
AB  - The establishment and succession of bacterial communities in infants may have a profound impact in their health, but information about the composition of meconium microbiota and its evolution in hospitalized preterm infants is scarce. In this context, the objective of this work was to characterize the microbiota of meconium and fecal samples obtained during the first 3 weeks of life from 14 donors using culture and molecular techniques, including DGGE and the Human Intestinal Tract Chip (HITChip) analysis of 16S rRNA amplicons. Culture techniques offer a quantification of cultivable bacteria and allow further study of the isolate, while molecular techniques provide deeper information on bacterial diversity. Culture and HITChip results were very similar but the former showed lower sensitivity. Inter-individual differences were detected in the microbiota profiles although the meconium microbiota was peculiar and distinct from that of fecal samples. Bacilli and other Firmicutes were the main bacteria groups detected in meconium while Proteobacteria dominated in the fecal samples. Culture technique showed that Staphylococcus predominated in meconium and that Enterococcus, together with Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Escherichia fergusonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, was more abundant in fecal samples. In addition, HITChip results showed the prevalence of bacteria related to Lactobacillus plantarum and Streptococcus mitis in meconium samples whereas those related to Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Yersinia predominated in the 3(rd) week feces. This study highlights that spontaneously-released meconium of preterm neonates contains a specific microbiota that differs from that of feces obtained after the first week of life. Our findings indicate that the presence of Serratia was strongly associated with a higher degree of immaturity and other hospital-related parameters, including antibiotherapy and mechanical ventilation.
TI  - Pediatric bloodstream infections in Cambodia, 2007 to 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric bacterial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Epidemiological data from resource-limited settings in southeast Asia, such as Cambodia, are sparse but have important implications for treatment and public health strategies. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated BSI in children at a pediatric hospital and its satellite clinic in Siem Reap, Cambodia, from January 1, 2007, to July 31, 2011. The range of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were analyzed in conjunction with demographic, clinical and outcome data. RESULTS: Of 7682 blood cultures with results (99.9% of cultures taken), 606 (7.9%) episodes of BSI were identified in 588 children. The incidence of BSI increased from 14 to 50/1000 admissions (P < 0.001); this was associated with an increased sampling rate. Most BSI were community acquired (89.1%). Common pathogens included Salmonella Typhi (22.8% of all isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (12.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (6.3%). 21.5% of BSI were caused by a diverse group of uncommon organisms, the majority of which were environmental Gram-negative species. No Listeria monocytogenes or Group B streptococcal BSI were identified. Antimicrobial resistance, particularly among the Enterobacteriaceae, was common. Overall mortality was substantial (19.0%), higher in neonates (36.9%) and independently associated with meningitis/meningoencephalitis and K. pneumoniae infection. CONCLUSIONS: BSI is a common problem in Cambodian children attending hospital and associated with significant mortality. Further studies are needed to clarify the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis, the contribution of atypical organisms and the epidemiology of pneumococcal disease before the introduction of vaccine.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - [Pyogenic liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae].
AB  - Pyogenic liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae is usually found in Southeast Asia, while in Europe Escherichia coli, Streptococcus or Staphylococcus are most common. In case of a failed ultrasound controlled abscess, aspiration surgical treatment is indicated. This paper reports the clinical case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which was treated by operative drainage. A 60-year-old patient was transferred to our institution from the University Hospital for Infectious Diseases with septic temperature, abdominal pain and finding of Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (resistant to antibiotic therapy). Additional laboratory tests and abdominal MSCT scan confirmed the initial diagnosis. The localization of abscesses technically prevented ultrasound-controlled abscess aspiration and drainage; after appropriate preparation, operative liver abscess incision and drainage were performed. Microbiological examination of the abscess sample revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae as the cause of liver abscess.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial and antitumor activities of some medicinal plant extracts, growing in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate antibacterial and antitumor activities of 51 different  extracts prepared with 3 types of solvents (water, ethanol and methanol) of 16 different plant species (Ajuga reptans (A. reptans) L., Phlomis pungens (P. pungens) Willd., Marrubium astracanicum (M. astracanicum) Jacq., Nepeta nuda (N. nuda) L., Stachys annua (S. annua) L., Genista lydia (G. lydia) Boiss., Nuphar lutea (N. lutea) L., Nymphaea alba (N. alba) L., Vinca minor (V. minor) L., Stellaria media (S. media) L., Capsella bursa-pastoris (C. bursa-pastoris) L., Galium spurium (G. spurium) L., Onosma heterophyllum (O. heterophyllum) Griseb., Reseda luteola (R. luteola) L., Viburnum lantana (V. lantana) L. and Mercurialis annua (M. annua) L.) grown in Turkey was conducted. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was evaluated with 10 bacteria including Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Escheria coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Proteus vulgaris (P. vulgaris), Enterobacter cloacae (E. cloacea), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) by using disc diffusion method. Antitumor activity was evaluated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens (A. tumefaciens)-induced potato disc tumor assay. RESULTS: Best antibacterial activity was obtained with ethanolic extract of P. pungens against S. pyogenes. Ethanolic and methanolic extract of N. alba and ethanolic extract of G. lydia also showed strong antibacterial activities. Results indicated that alcoholic extracts especially ethanolic extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Best antitumor activity was obtained with methanolic extracts of N. alba and V. lantana (100% tumor inhibition). Ethanolic extract of N. alba, alcoholic extracts of N. lutea, A. reptans and V. minor flowers, methanolic extracts of G. lydia and O. heterophyllum and ethanolic extract of V. lantana and aqueous extract of V. minor leaves exhibited strong tumor inhibitions. CONCLUSIONS: In near future works, identification of active components can be studied for plant extracts having strong bioactivity.
TI  - Spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. So far, data on this topic among Chinese are lacking. METHODS: A surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with AECOPD at five areas in China between October 2006 and April 2008. The sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by Haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and Escherichia coli (3.6%). The majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with AECOPD in China. Haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in AECOPD. This study provides evidence for local surveillance of AECOPD pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in China.
TI  - Comparison of the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens by applying time-series analysis in results of milk samples submitted for microbiological examination.
AB  - The objective of this study is to examine and compare the trends of mastitis pathogens in quarter milk samples (n = 240,232) submitted for microbiological examination at the Milk Analysis Laboratory (L.I.G.A.L.) at Galicia, Spain from June 2005 to September 2011. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and multivariate statistical techniques such as Cluster Analysis were used in order to detect seasonal trends and similarities between the series trends and to classify mastitis pathogens into relatively homogeneous groups. The decrease of bulk milk somatic cell counts achieved by the mastitis control program, developed in recent years in this region, is the result of the decrease in IMI caused by a limited number of mastitis pathogens. The obtained results reflect a greater complexity in the behavior of mastitis pathogens, unlike the traditional classification into contagious or environmental. Staphylococcus aureus showed a trend similar to Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a mastitis pathogen can behave in both a contagious and an environmental manner. Among the traditionally considered environmental mastitis pathogens, Strep. uberis showed a different behavior to Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species and Streptococcus other than Strep. agalactiae showed differences in the trend model. Time-series analysis and multivariate statistical techniques, such as Cluster Analysis, could be powerful tools to assess the isolation trend of mastitis pathogens because of their ability to cope with stochastic dependence of consecutive data. Furthermore, they could be used to identify the epidemiological behavior of mastitis pathogens using the results of milk samples submitted for routine microbiological examination, by classifying them into relatively homogeneous groups.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam combinations against ESBL pathogens in respiratory and urinary infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and subsequent widespread dissemination of bacterial resistance to a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics by the elaboration of ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase) poses a serious threat to the effective use of beta lactam antibiotics and cephalosporins. Cefoperazone combination with the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam would be a strong basis for rational therapeutics when dealing with ESBL producing pathogen mediated infections. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the in vitro efficacy of cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam against ESBL producing respiratory and urinary pathogens. METHODOLOGY: 54 samples (34 samples of urine and 20 samples of sputum) were collected from 9 hospitals in Mumbai. The pathogens isolated from urine included E. coli (n = 27), K. pneumoniae (n = 6), and Serratia marcescens (n = 1). The pathogens isolated from sputum included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14). The Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the susceptibility of the isolated pathogens to cefoperazone-tazobactam and cefoperazone-sulbactam. RESULTS: In sputum samples, all the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam while one isolate was resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were sensitive to both the antibiotic formulations. In uropathogens, higher susceptibility rates to cefoperazone-tazobactam (96% vs. 89%) were observed for Escherichia coli. Similarly higher rates of susceptibility to cefoperazone-tazobactam were observed for Klebsiella as compared to cefoperazone-sulbactam (83% vs. 67%). Serratia marcescens was sensitive to cefoperazone-tazobactam but was intermediate resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam. The isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae that were resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam were susceptible to cefoperazone-tazobactam. CONCLUSION: The results of the current in vitro study corroborate the efficacy of the beta lactamase inhibitor tazobactam in improving the spectrum of activity and efficacy of cefoperazone.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of Turkey.
AB  - Empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. The aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. In this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the Department of Oncology of Gaziantep Children Hospital November 2007 and February 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the BACTEC system. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the Vitek2((R)) system according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). The main isolated Gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). S. aureus and Streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. S aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). Seven E. faecium, 7 E. fecalis and 1 E. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) Enterococcus spp. isolates. Among gram-negative bacteria E. coli (30.2%) was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and Proteus spp. (18.6%). Imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all Gram-negative isolates. To know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.
TI  - In-Vitro, Anti-Bacterial Activities of Aqueous Extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo Against Gram Positive and Gram Negative Bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluations of the in-vitro anti-bacterial activities of aqueous extracts of Acacia catechu (L.F.)Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and Shilajita mumiyo against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) are reasonable since these ethnomedicinal plants have been used in Persian folk medicine for treating skin diseases, venereal diseases, respiratory problems and nervous disorders for ages. METHODS: The well diffusion method (KB testing) with a concentration of 250 mug/disc was used for evaluating the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Maximum synergistic effects of different combinations of components were also observed. RESULTS: A particular combination of Acacia catechu (L.F.) Willd, Castanea sativa, Ephedra sinica stapf and shilajita mumiyo extracts possesses an outstanding anti-bacterial activity. It's inhibiting effect on microorganisms is significant when compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive microorganism. The highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia) or gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was exerted by formula number 2 (Table1). CONCLUSION: The results reveal the presence of antibacterial activities of Acacia catechu, Castanea sativa husk, Ephedra sp. and Mumiyo against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Synergistic effects in a combined formula, especially in formula number 2 (ASLAN()) can lead to potential sources of new antiseptic agents for treatment of acute or chronic skin ulcers. These results considering the significant antibacterial effect of the present formulation, support ethno-pharmacological uses against diarrheal and venereal diseases and demonstrate use of these plants to treat infectious diseases.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Volatile metabolites of pathogens: a systematic review.
AB  - Ideally, invading bacteria are detected as early as possible in critically ill patients: the strain of morbific pathogens is identified rapidly, and antimicrobial sensitivity is known well before the start of new antimicrobial therapy. Bacteria have a distinct metabolism, part of which results in the production of bacteria-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which might be used for diagnostic purposes. Volatile metabolites can be investigated directly in exhaled air, allowing for noninvasive monitoring. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of VOCs produced by the six most abundant and pathogenic bacteria in sepsis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Such VOCs could be used as biological markers in the diagnostic approach of critically ill patients. A systematic review of existing literature revealed 31 articles. All six bacteria of interest produce isopentanol, formaldehyde, methyl mercaptan, and trimethylamine. Since humans do not produce these VOCs, they could serve as biological markers for presence of these pathogens. The following volatile biomarkers were found for identification of specific strains: isovaleric acid and 2-methyl-butanal for Staphylococcus aureus; 1-undecene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-heptane, 2-butanone, 4-methyl-quinazoline, hydrogen cyanide, and methyl thiocyanide for Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and methanol, pentanol, ethyl acetate, and indole for Escherichia coli. Notably, several factors that may effect VOC production were not controlled for, including used culture media, bacterial growth phase, and genomic variation within bacterial strains. In conclusion, VOCs produced by bacteria may serve as biological markers for their presence. Goal-targeted studies should be performed to identify potential sets of volatile biological markers and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in critically ill patients.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and physicochemical properties of a crude methanol extract of the larvae of the blow fly Lucilia cuprina.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains has prompted the reintroduction of maggot therapy in the treatment of chronic, infected wounds. Many previous studies have demonstrated the potent antibacterial activity of larval excretions/secretions of the blowfly Lucilia sericata (Meigen) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against bacteria. However, the antibacterial activity of its sibling species, Lucilia cuprina (Wiedemann) (Diptera:Calliphoridae) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has never been determined. The aim of this study was to develop a new procedure to produce whole body extract of larvae of L. cuprina via methanol extraction as well as to demonstrate the in vitro antibacterial activity of this extract against seven selected wound pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli). The turbidimetric assay demonstrated that L. cuprina larval extract was significantly potent against all bacteria tested (P < 0.001). Additionally, colony-forming unit (CFU), agar well diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration assays have confirmed the apparent potency of larval extract against P. aeruginosa. The reconstituted larval extract was highly robust and thermally stable. These observations substantiated the feasibility of the methanol extraction method in the production of larval extract.
TI  - Changes in fluoroquinolone resistance over 5 years (CANWARD 2007-11) in bacterial pathogens isolated in Canadian hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyse Canadian national surveillance data, specifically fluoroquinolone resistance, from 2007 to 2011 inclusive, to determine trends in resistance over time and to assess correlations with patient demographic factors. METHODS: All isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae collected by the 10 sites that participated in the annual CANWARD surveillance studies in each of the 5 years were included in this analysis. A multifactorial logistic regression model was used to determine the variables with significant impact on fluoroquinolone resistance. RESULTS: The proportion of E. coli isolates resistant to ciprofloxacin increased significantly (P = 0.0005) between 2007 (20.0%) and 2011 (29.2%), although similar increases were not seen in K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. pneumoniae (tested against levofloxacin) (P > 0.05). Among isolates of S. aureus, there was a significant decrease in ciprofloxacin resistance from 34.4% in 2007 to 24.6% in 2011 (P < 0.0001). Resistance to ciprofloxacin was a component of most multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes for E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, primarily among urine isolates, and a significant decrease in the percentage of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus occurred between 2007 and 2011. Notably, MDR isolates were frequently fluoroquinolone resistant for all organisms studied, except S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Analysis of antimicrobial resistance and class 1 integrons among strains from upper respiratory tract of healthy adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The distribution and characterization of integrons among opportunistic pathogens from nasopharynx of healthy adults. METHODS: A total of 1,019 nasopharyngeal samples from healthy adults were collected; bacteria were identified by API system; antibiotic susceptibility were tested by K-B method; class 1, 2 and 3 integrons were examined by degenerate primers of the genetic content of integrons were analyzed by PCR and DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Out of the 1,019 cases, 743 (72.9%) opportunistic pathogens were isolated. The top five commons organism identified were Coagulase-negative staphylococcus (n=404), Staphylococcus aureus (n=109), Haemophilus influenzae (n=74), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=49) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=32). Eight (25.0%) isolates of K. pneumoniae produced the ESBLs. The isolated rates of S. aureus and H. influenzae were decreased with aging. 6.3% (2/32) K. pneumoniae isolates and 16.7% (1/8) Proteus isolates carried class 1 integrons. Among intI1-positive strains, sequencing analysis revealed that one of the integron positive K. pneumoniae isolates harbored gene cassette aadA5-dfrA17. Proteus isolates harbored gene cassette aadA2-dhfrXII. CONCLUSIONS: The results stressed the need for continued surveillance of bacteria from the asymptomatic carriers.
TI  - Azithromycin, fluoroquinolone and chloramphenicol resistance of non-chlamydia conjunctival bacteria in rural community of Ethiopia.
AB  - AIM: To determine profiles of non-chlamydia conjunctival bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility from adults who underwent trachomatous trichiasis surgery in rural areas of Ethiopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural districts in West Gojjam administrative zone. Conjunctival swabs were collected during surgery and transported using Stuart transport broth (Oxoid, UK). Antibiotic susceptibility of conjunctival isolates was determined using the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion method. RESULTS: Non-chlamydia pathogenic bacteria were recovered from conjunctiva of 438 (31%) participants before treatment. The isolated conjunctival bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Streptococcus group (A, C, F and G), Enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella spp., Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Enterobacter spp. Overall, resistance rates of 57.8% to azithromycin and 68.5% to chloramphenicol were found. However, 86-94.4% sensitivity was demonstrated to ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin. Moderate sensitivity rates (61.8-78.4%) were observed to ceftriaxone, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole. CONCLUSION: Fluoroquinolones that have activity against the majority of bacterial isolates were potent at in vitro. However, unacceptably high levels of resistance to azithromycin and chloramphenicol in rural community indicated a need for further study and antimicrobial resistance surveillance.
TI  - [Microbial structure of acute bacterial conjunctivitis].
AB  - Microbiological investigation of 124 patients with acute conjunctivitis which were treated in one of Tbilisi policlinics in 2010-12 years, was performed; microbial structure containing 124 microbial strains of different species was detected. Namely, following species of microorganisms were isolated: S. aureus - 35 strains (28,2%), Str. pneumoniae - 10 strains (8,1%), S. epidermidis - 6 strains (4,8%), Ps. aeruginosa - 24 strains (19,4%), Moraxella catarrhalis - 21 strains (16,9%), Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegipticus - 17 strains (13,7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae - 11 strains (8,9%). Identification of microorganisms was performed using classic methods of microbiological explorations and test systems API (bio Meriux). Study of sensitivity/resistance to antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, tobramicin, norfoloxacin, moxifloxacin) containing in eye drops, was performed by diffusion in agar. High level of resistance to this antibiotic was found. As a result it is recommended to perform microbiological investigation in each case of acute conjunctivitis, to receive rational treatment.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia in diabetic and non-diabetic hospitalized patients:  presentation, causative pathogens and outcome.
AB  - Both community acquired pneumonia (CAP) and diabetes mellitus are common in Bangladesh. Though hospitalization of diabetic patients with CAP is increasing, data regarding their clinical presentation, microbial characteristics, antimicrobial susceptibility and outcome are lacking. This study was aimed at finding any difference in clinical presentation, bacterial causes, antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolated bacteria and outcome in diabetic and non-diabetic hospitalized patients with CAP. In this study total 47 diabetic and 43 non-diabetic adult hospitalized patients with CAP were enrolled. Clinical presentation of CAP differed in diabetics and non-diabetics. Frequency of atypical presentation and CURB-65 score were significantly higher in diabetics. Pleural effusion with multilobar infiltration was also common feature for CAP in diabetic patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent causative pathogen for CAP in diabetic patients, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent causative agent for non-diabetic patients. Bacteria isolated from sputum sample of diabetic patients with CAP were resistant to almost all recommended antibiotics used for CAP but 100% of isolates were sensitive to Carbapenems. Pulmonary complications were relatively more in diabetics than in non-diabetics. Hospitalized diabetics with CAP required referral to intensive care unit more than that of non-diabetics. So, diabetic patients with CAP need extra attention.
TI  - Pattern of urinary tract infection in Kashmir and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance of urinary tract pathogens has increased worldwide. The purpose of this study is to provide information regarding the causative agents of urinary tract infection in Kashmiri patients, identify the uropathogens responsible for the infection and study the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the uropathogens. Clean voided mid-stream urine samples were collected from 2190 patients. The specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. The antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined. Of 2190 specimens, 591 (27%) showed significant growth upon culture. Approximately 84.1% (497/591) of the 591 patients with UTI were females, most of which belonged to the 21-30 age group (206). The males accounted for 15.9% (94/591) UTI cases. Most of the male patients belonged to the 21-30 age group (34). The lowest incidence of urinary tract infections was seen among the 13-20 years age group. Throughout this study males accounted for only 16% of all UTI cases. Escherichia coli was the most predominant isolate, 53.8% followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae 22.4% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 7.6%. All isolates were fully sensitive to ofloxacin, and more than 94% were sensitive to cefuroxime. Apart from group D Streptococcus, the overall response to ampicillin by all isolates was less than 15%. The prevalence of multi-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa in community-acquired urinary tract infections is increasing. All Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were fully susceptible to cefuroxime and ofloxacin. It is recommended that cefuroxime and ofloxacin or both are used in the blind treatment of urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. Concurrent with the necessary shift in the prescription pattern, attention should be paid to restriction of antibiotic abuse in the community to retard development of further drug resistance.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern and cost-effectiveness analysis of antibiotic therapy in an Indian tertiary care teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of microorganisms, to study the antibiotic usage pattern, and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the antibiotics prescribed in a tertiary care teaching hospital in south India. METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in the General Medicine and Pulmonology departments of the hospital for a period of 6 months. The study was carried out in three phases: A prospective analysis to check the sensitivity pattern of microorganisms to various antibiotics, data extraction and determining the cost of antibiotics and finally evaluation of the sensitivity pattern of microorganisms and the antibiotic usage. A total of 796 documented records were analyzed. FINDINGS: It was found that Escherichia coli was the major organism identified in 36.4% of the isolated specimens, followed by Klebsiella sp. (18.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), and Pseudomonas (9.3%). The sensitivity pattern data of the prospective study revealed that E. coli was highly sensitive to Amikacin (99.3%), Klebsiella to Amikacin (93.8%), Pseudomonas to Meropenem (97.6%), and S. pneumoniae to Ofloxacin (93.8%). In the prescribing pattern study, it was found that the most common disease (21.2%) was found to be lower respiratory tract infection in 51 patients. Cephalosporins (73%), in particular Ceftriaxone (63.5%) was highly prescribed, followed by fluoroquinolones (53.9%). In the CEA, it was revealed that Ceftriaxone was the cost-effective antibiotic with a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of 78.27 compared to Levofloxacin, which had a CER of 95.13. CONCLUSION: Continuous surveillance of susceptibility testing is necessary for cost-effective customization of empiric antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, reliable statistics on antibiotic resistance and policies should be made available.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline and comparator agents tested against bacterial isolates causing skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired respiratory tract infections isolated from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a cephalosporin with in vitro bactericidal activity against resistant Gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and common Gram-negative organisms, including wild-type Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the in vitro activity of ceftaroline and selected comparator agents against bacterial isolates collected from patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI) in the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa. A total of 2351 isolates, 1100 from SSTI and 1251 from CARTI, were collected from 25 medical centers distributed across 8 countries as part of the 2010 AWARE ceftaroline surveillance program and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftaroline was very active against S. aureus (MIC50/90, 0.25/1 mug/mL; 93.4% susceptible), including MRSA (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/mL; 80.6% susceptible). Against beta-hemolytic streptococci, ceftaroline demonstrated greater activity (MIC90, 0.015 mug/mL) than penicillin (MIC90, 0.06 mug/mL). Ceftaroline was also highly active against viridans group streptococci (MIC90, 0.12 mug/mL). Similarly to ceftriaxone, ceftaroline activity against Escherichia coli (MIC50/90, >32/>32 mug/mL) and Klebsiella spp. (MIC50/90, 0.12/>32 mug/mL) was compromised by the high prevalence of isolates with an ESBL phenotype in the region, particularly in China. Ceftaroline was the most potent beta-lactam tested against S. pneumoniae (MIC50/90 of 0.015/0.25 mug/mL; 99.8% susceptible by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute [CLSI] criteria), and it was also highly potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.03 mug/mL; 100% susceptible by CLSI criteria). Ceftaroline was also active against H. parainfluenzae (MIC50/90, </= 0.008/0.015 mug/mL) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/mL). In summary, ceftaroline showed potent in vitro activity against a large collection of bacterial isolates (2351) associated with SSTI and CARTI from the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.
TI  - Secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breathprinting of multiple bacterial lung pathogens, a mouse model study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is one of the leading causes of disease-related morbidity and mortality in the world, in part because the diagnostic tools for pneumonia are slow and ineffective. To improve the diagnosis success rates and treatment outcomes for bacterial lung infections, we are exploring the use of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS) breath analysis as a rapid, noninvasive method for determining the etiology of lung infections in situ. Using a murine lung infection model, we demonstrate that SESI-MS breathprints can be used to distinguish mice that are infected with one of seven lung pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, representing the primary causes of bacterial pneumonia worldwide. After applying principal components analysis, we observed that with the first three principal components (primarily comprised of data from 14 peaks), all infections were separable via SESI-MS breathprinting (P < 0.0001). Therefore, we have shown the potential of this SESI-MS approach for rapidly detecting and identifying acute bacterial lung infections in situ via breath analysis.
TI  - Acinetobacter is the most common pathogen associated with late-onset and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia in an adult intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are highly dependent on the type of causative pathogen and the time of diagnosis. The objective of this study was to examine the microbial causes of VAP and describe any variability by the timing of VAP onset and over time. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted in the adult general intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Microbial isolates obtained from blood and different respiratory specimens of patients diagnosed with VAP (using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition) between August 2003 and June 2009 were included. RESULTS: A total of 457 pathogens were identified during the study; 380 (83.2%) were associated with primary VAP and 77 (16.8%) were associated with recurrent VAP. Of primary VAP pathogens, 159 (41.8%) were associated with early-onset (<5 days) and 221 (58.2%) were associated with late-onset (>/=5 days) VAP. The most common pathogen identified was Acinetobacter spp (26.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (15.3%), Klebsiella spp (6.8%), Haemophilus spp (6.1%), and Enterobacter spp (5.0%). Acinetobacter spp and MRSA were significantly associated with late-onset VAP while Haemophilus spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly associated with early-onset VAP. Acinetobacter spp was the only pathogen associated with recurrent VAP and its incidence showed a significant increasing trend during the study period. Acinetobacter spp was significantly associated with prolonged ventilation, sedation, and nasogastric intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most common and increasingly important pathogen associated with VAP in our patients, especially late-onset and recurrent VAP.
TI  - Serum in vivo and in vitro activity of single dose of ertapenem in surgical obese patients for prevention of SSIs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite progress made in the control of post-operative infections, the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) is still high. An improper perioperative antibiotic use can expose patients to the risk of resistant microorganisms, and, in surgical obese patients, the drug dosage and infusion time are critical points. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ertapenem in the prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients undergoing general or bariatric surgery. METHODS: A total of 63 obese patients, candidates for several surgical interventions, were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients received antibiotic prophylaxis before surgery: the case group received venous infusion of ertapenem; the control group received standard prophylaxis. Serum samples were tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. RESULTS: After single-dose ertapenem in obese patients, we registered in vitro activity of sera against the growth of non-extended beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and non-ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Moreover, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans were also inhibited. We found in vivo efficacy according to clinical monitoring: at the weekly and monthly follow-ups, one patient in the case group and six patients in the control group presented superficial incisional SSIs. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results are suggestive of the efficacy of ertapenem in perioperative prophylaxis of SSIs in obese patients; however, they need to be confirmed by further investigations and more defined trials.
TI  - Microfiltration of brilliant blue G dye.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brilliant blue G (BBG) is a safe and effective dye used to highlight  the internal limiting membrane during macular surgery. The authors proposed that the utilization of a 0.22-mum filter intraoperatively can reduce the risk of inoculating an eye with contaminated BBG. METHODS: An in vitro model of contaminated BBG was prepared. Laboratory stock cultures of 7 organisms including, Staphyloccocus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphyloccocus aureus, Haemophilus influenza, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusarium species, and Candida albicans, were prepared in five 10-fold dilutions and injected into BBG vials. These mixtures were drawn with either a 5-mum filter, 0.22-mum, or without a filter and cultured on appropriate plates and growth conditions. RESULTS: No culture plates that had inoculate drawn through a 0.22-mum filter showed evidence of growth. There was evidence of growth for all organisms when no filter was used. A 5 mum was insufficient to filter Fusarium species. CONCLUSION: Using a 0.22-mum filter in the intraoperative processing of BBG would likely reduce the risk of infectious endophthalmitis resulting from contaminated dye.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Allium hirtifolium Boiss.
AB  - Allium hirtifolium Boiss. known as Persian shallot, is a spice used as a traditional medicine in Iran and, Mediterranean region. In this study, the chemical composition of the hydromethanolic extract of this plant was analyzed using GC/MS. The result showed that 9-hexadecenoic acid, 11,14-eicosadienoic acid, and n-hexadecanoic acid are the main constituents. The antibacterial activity of the shallot extract was also examined by disk diffusion and microdilution broth assays. It was demonstrated that Persian shallot hydromethanolic extract was effective against 10 different species of pathogenic bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Specifically, the minimum concentration of the extract which inhibited bacterial growth (MIC values) was 1.88 mg/mL for most of the gram-positive bacteria. This concentration was not much different from the concentration that was safe for mammalian cells (1.50 mg/mL) suggesting that the hydromethanolic extract of Persian shallot may be a safe and strong antibacterial agent.
TI  - Late respiratory infection after lung transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (LTx) patients, we  reviewed risk factors and treatment practices for the LTx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-LTx period (>1 month after LTx). METHODS: We analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61 LTx, who experienced late respiratory infections. Late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. The organisms most frequently involved were gram (-) bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). Among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late post-LTx period. These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%) infections. Of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii and one from each of MDR P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (+) K. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes (43%). CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-LTx period, respiratory infection was still a major cause of mortality. Gram (-) MDR bacteria were the agents most commonly identified in these infections.
TI  - [The comparative evaluation of informativity of methods of etiologic diagnostics  of community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - The article deals with the results of selection and testing of oligonucleotide primers to gene 16S pRN4 of a number of agents of community'-acquired pneumonia (Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemorhilus influenzae. Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumonia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. StaphyIococcus aureus) for their highly specified detection in clinical material on application of polymerase chain reaction. The comparison with bacteriological method (golden standard) is used to demonstrate the high sensibility, specificity and diagnostic effectiveness of product enabling to apply it in practice to diagnose communitly-acquired pneumonia regardless of duration, severity and phase of disease and to develop corresponding diagnostic systems.
TI  - Spectrum and potency of ceftaroline tested against leading pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections in Europe (2010).
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active metabolite of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel cephalosporin exhibiting bactericidal activity in vitro against Gram-positive organisms, including meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), beta-haemolytic streptococci, viridans group streptococci (VGS) and Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as against many common Gram-negative organisms. The objective of this study was to determine the spectrum and potency of ceftaroline against recent (2010) leading pathogens causing complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (cSSTIs) isolated in Europe. A total of 2438 isolates from the Assessing Worldwide Antimicrobial Resistance and Evaluation (AWARE) programme were identified as cSSTI pathogens. Isolates were collected from patients in 52 medical centres in 19 European countries. Reference susceptibility testing for ceftaroline and commonly used antimicrobials was performed by broth microdilution methodologies. Ceftaroline was very active overall against S. aureus (MIC(50/90)=0.25/1 mg/L) and inhibited 100.0% of isolates at a MIC of </=2 mg/L. Activity against MRSA was documented (MIC(50/90)=1/2 mg/L) but was lower than that observed against MSSA (MIC(50/90)=0.25/0.25 mg/L). Ceftaroline was also very active against 460 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 93 VGS (MIC(90)=0.015 mg/L and 0.06 mg/L, respectively). Ceftaroline was active against Escherichia coli (MIC(50)=0.12 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC(50)=0.06 mg/L) not expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, with activity similar to ceftriaxone and ceftazidime. In summary, this study documents the potent in vitro activity of ceftaroline when tested against recent pathogens isolated from patients with cSSTI in Europe.
TI  - Serum adhesion molecules as predictors of bacteremia in adult severe sepsis patients at the emergency department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is a severe bacterial infection with significant mortality. Clinical parameters that reliably predict it are less elucidated. We assessed the potential of serum adhesion molecules for predicting bacteremia and compare it with current available infection biomarkers to determine a more timely predictor of adult severe sepsis patients on admission to the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Sixty-seven consecutive non-traumatic, non-surgical adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to the ED were evaluated. Serum samples were collected and assessed while serum adhesion molecules were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-one (46.2%) study patients had bacteremia. There were significant differences in both sICAM-1 and sE-selectin on admission between bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients. By stepwise logistic regression model, only sE-selectin was independently associated with bacteremia and any 1 ng/ml increase in level increased bacteremia rate by 0.8%. The cut-off value of sE-selectin level for predicting bacteremia was 117 ng/ml (84% sensitivity and 69% specificity). CONCLUSION: Although serum cell adhesion markers are not specific for predicting bacteremia in septic patients, higher mean serum cell adhesion molecules levels on admission may imply both more severe infection and presence of bacteremia. Assay of serum adhesion molecules may be added as an infectious marker among the panel of bacteremic parameters in clinical practice, especially since early diagnosis and prompt antimicrobial therapy are essentially for survival.
TI  - Predictors of viral pneumonia: the need for viral testing in all patients hospitalized for nursing home-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - AIM: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is presumed to be bacterial in origin and empirical antibiotics are almost always given on admission. However, early detection of viral infection is also very important for hospital infection control and timely use of antiviral agents. The present study aimed to compare patients with viral and bacterial pneumonia, and identify independent predictors of viral pneumonia. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out in a tertiary teaching hospital in a 1-year period. Older patients (aged >/= 65 years) were recruited if they were admitted for CAP confirmed by chest radiographs. RESULTS: A cohort of 488 patients was analyzed. Infective causes were found in 137 (28.1%) patients. Bacterial, viral and mixed infections were detected in 86 (17.6%), 41 (8.4%) and 10 (2.0%) patients, respectively. Bacteriology was established mostly by sputum culture and virology by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) viral culture. The commonest bacterial isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (31), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Klebsiella spp. (9) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6). Influenza A virus (28, 8 were pandemic 2009 A/H1N1 subtype) and respiratory syncytial virus (16) were the most frequent viral causes. Independent predictors of viral pneumonia included nursing home residence (RR 3.056, P = 0.009) and absence of leukocytosis (RR 0.425, P = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: All nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP should undergo NPA viral testing because of infection control, early antiviral treatment and discharge planning. We suggest that empirical antiviral agents might be considered for nursing home residents hospitalized for CAP if outbreaks of influenza-like illness are reported in nursing homes.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - [Etiologies of non tuberculous empyema in adult patients infected with HIV in a service of pneumology, Abidjan (Ivory Coast)].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the main bacteria that cause thoracic empyema of HIV-infected patients. METHODS: Retrospective study analyzing the etiology of thoracic empyema in patients admitted to the pneumology clinic of the university hospital center in Abidjan from January 1998 to December 2010. We included all patients with bacteriologically confirmed thoracic empyema and had serological test for HIV. We compared the different pathogens based on HIV status. RESULTS: There were 42 patients of thoracic empyema composed of 24 (63.3%) HIV-infected patients [15 (62.5%) males and nine (37.5%) women] and 18 (36.7%) HIV-negative patients [13 (72.22%) men and five (27.78%) women]. The average age of HIV-infected patients was 41.2 years and 44.8 years for HIV-negative patients. HIV status was known only for 4.76% patients at admission, and most of them had a severe stage of immune suppression, (the average T CD4 cell count was 96/mm(3)). Pleurisy was monomicrobial in 83.33% HIV-infected patients and 94.4% HIV-negative patients. It was polymicrobial in 16.67% immunocompromised patients and 5.56% HIV-negative patient. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 58.33% HIV-infected patients. Streptococcus Pneumoniae was observed in 61.11% HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria are the main causes of thoracic empyema in patients HIV-infected.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of bactericidal silver nanoparticles using cultural filtrate of simulated microgravity grown Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles were synthesized by biological method using cultural filtrate of Klebsiella pneumoniae cultured under simulated microgravity and silver nitrate solution as precursor. The nanoparticles exhibited typical plasmon absorption maximum of silver nanoparticles between 405 and 407 nm. Spherical silver nanoparticles were found to have size between 15 and 37 nm by TEM analysis. XRD pattern corresponding to planes (111), (200), (220) (311) revealed the crystalline nature of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles. FTIR spectrum proposed stabilization of silver nanoparticles by the protein molecules present in the cultural filtrate. The silver nanoparticles exhibited high bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli and moderate bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pyogenes.
TI  - Bacteremia, causative agents and antimicrobial susceptibility among HIV-1-infected children on antiretroviral therapy in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteremia is common in HIV-infected children in Africa, including after start of antiretroviral therapy (ART), but there are limited data on causative pathogens and their antimicrobial sensitivity patterns in this population. METHODS: We analyzed data on blood cultures taken from HIV-infected children developing acute febrile illness after enrollment to the Antiretroviral Research for Watoto (ARROW) clinical trial in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Patterns of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined and bacteremia rates calculated over time from ART initiation. RESULTS: A total of 848 blood cultures were obtained from 461 children, of which 123 (14.5%) from 105 children (median age 3.5 years, 51% girls) were culture positive, including 75 (8.8%) with clearly pathogenic organisms. The event rates for positive cultures with clearly pathogenic organisms after 0-1, 2-3, 4-11 and >/=12 months on ART were 13.3, 11.4, 2.1 and 0.3 per 1000 person-months of follow-up, respectively. The pathogens isolated (n; %) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (36; 28.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (11; 8.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6; 4.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6; 4.7%), Salmonella spp (6; 4.7%), Escherichia coli (5; 3.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (1; 0.8%) and fungal spp (4; 3.1%). Other bacteria of doubtful pathogenicity (n = 52; 42%) were also isolated. Most isolates tested were highly (80-100%) susceptible to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin; very few (~5%) were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; S. pneumoniae had high susceptibility to amoxicillin/ampicillin (80%). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of proven bacteremia were >20-fold higher immediately after starting ART compared with 12 months later in African HIV-infected children. S. pneumoniae was most commonly isolated, suggesting need for pneumococcal vaccination and effective prophylactic antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftaroline-avibactam tested against clinical isolates  collected from U.S. Medical Centers in 2010-2011.
AB  - Ceftaroline-avibactam and comparator agents were tested by the broth microdilution method against 20,089 isolates consecutively collected in 2010 and 2011 from 75 U.S. medical centers. Ceftaroline-avibactam was active against Enterobacteriaceae (4,908 strains; MIC90, 0.25 mug/ml; highest MIC, 4 mug/ml), including meropenem-nonsusceptible Klebsiella spp. and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible Enterobacter cloacae strains (MIC90, 1 mug/ml for both). Ceftaroline-avibactam was also active against ceftriaxone-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.25 mug/ml) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(90), 1 mug/ml).
TI  - Pathogen diagnosis of children sepsis by LAMP technology.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore a rapid diagnostic method in neonatal sepsis and bacterial  meningitis. METHODS: The primers were designed and synthesized based on 16S rRNA gene of Staphylococcus aureus. Four specimens of Staphylococcus aureus, 16 specimens of coagulase-negative Staphylococci, 2 specimens of Enterococci, 3 specimens of Streptococcus, 1 specimen of Micrococcus, 3 specimens of Escherichia coli, 4 specimens of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 specimens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 specimens of Enterobacter cloacae, and 5 specimens of Acinetobacter were tested by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A total of 118 clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were collected and detected with both LAMP assay and blood culture. RESULTS: By designing primers specific for Staphylococcus aureus, specimens containing different kinds of pathogens were carried out by LAMP assay, and our data showed LAMP technology for the specific detection of Staphylococcus aureus in samples was successfully established. All clinical specimens of sepsis and non-sepsis were tested by both blood cultures and LAMP, and our data showed that compared wit blood culture method, the LAMP technology showed significantly high detection rate (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: As a quick and easy detection of Staphylococcus aureus, the LAMP technology was successfully established, laid the foundation for the diagnosis and treatment of children Staphylococcus aureus sepsis, and showed great promotion and application value.
TI  - Rapid identification of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, and Streptococcus pneumoniae using triplex polymerase chain reaction in rodents.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium kutscheri, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are important pathogens that cause respiratory infections in laboratory rodents. In this study, we used species-specific triplex PCR analysis to directly detect three common bacterial pathogens associated with respiratory diseases. Specific targets were amplified with conventional PCR using the tyrB gene from K. pneumoniae, gyrB gene from C. kutscheri, and ply gene from S. pneumoniae. Our primers were tested against purified DNA from another eleven murine bacteria to determine primer specificity. Under optimal PCR conditions, the triplex assay simultaneously yielded a 931 bp product from K. pneumoniae, a 540 bp product from C. kutscheri, and a 354 bp product from S. pneumoniae. The triplex assay detection thresholds for pure cultures were 10 pg for K. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae, and 100 pg for C. kutscheri. All three bacteria were successfully identified in the trachea and lung of experimentally infected mice at the same time. Our triplex PCR method can be used as a useful method for detecting pathogenic bacterial infections in laboratory rodents.
TI  - Microparticles containing propolis and metronidazole: in vitro characterization,  release study and antimicrobial activity against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Ethylcellulose microparticles containing metronidazole and propolis extractive solution were prepared and evaluated in vitro against periodontal pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis, drug entrapment efficiency and drug release of microparticles were determined. The antimicrobial activity of microparticles was evaluated against microorganisms of periodontal importance (Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). It was obtained particles with regular morphology, mean diameter of 1.23 microm, and entrapment efficiency for propolis and metronidazole were 91.41% and 22.23%, respectively. In vitro release studies of propolis and metronidazole from microparticles showed prolonged drug release and controlled by Fickian diffusion. Both propolis and metronidazole displayed activity against the tested strains. Moreover, the results showed that the strains of E. faecalis, S. pyogenes and S. mutans were more susceptible to the propolis and E. faecalis to the metronidazole. It was also observed that the amount of metronidazole to inhibit the microorganism strains in the physical mixture with propolis was smaller than in the metronidazole alone, suggesting potentiation effect between propolis and metronidazole. These microparticles would be useful for developing intermediary or eventual dosage form to be administered into the periodontal pocket more easily and safely.
TI  - Bacteria can promote calcium oxalate crystal growth and aggregation.
AB  - Our previous report showed that uropathogenic bacteria, e.g., Escherichia coli, are commonly found inside the nidus of calcium oxalate (CaOx) kidney stones and may play pivotal roles in stone genesis. The present study aimed to prove this new hypothesis by direct examining CaOx lithogenic activities of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. CaOx was crystallized in the absence (blank control) or presence of 10(5) CFU/ml E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Fragmented red blood cell membranes and intact red blood cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The crystal area and the number of aggregates were measured to initially screen for effects of bacteria on CaOx crystal growth and aggregation. The data revealed that all the bacteria tested dramatically increased the crystal area and number of crystal aggregates. Validation assays (spectrophotometric oxalate-depletion assay and an aggregation-sedimentation study) confirmed their promoting effects on both growth (20.17 +/- 3.42, 17.55 +/- 2.27, 16.37 +/- 1.38, and 21.87 +/- 0.85 % increase, respectively) and aggregation (57.45 +/- 2.08, 51.06 +/- 5.51, 55.32 +/- 2.08, and 46.81 +/- 3.61 % increase, respectively) of CaOx crystals. Also, these bacteria significantly enlarged CaOx aggregates, with the diameter greater than the luminal size of distal tubules, implying that tubular occlusion might occur. Moreover, these bacterial effects were dose-dependent and specific to intact viable bacteria, not intact dead or fragmented bacteria. In summary, intact viable E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae had significant promoting effects on CaOx crystal growth and aggregation. This functional evidence supported the hypothesis that various types of bacteria can induce or aggravate metabolic stone disease, particularly the CaOx type.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) extracts and its main constituents.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Diospyros bipindensis (Gurke) stem bark is used in Cameroon by Baka Pygmies for the treatment of respiratory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and antioxidant properties of constituents from the bark extracts through bioassay-guided fractionation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity of extracts, fractions and pure compounds was assessed through the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory mediator nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. DPPH, ABTS and ORAC assays were used for determining the antioxidant properties. The activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was evaluated on the basis of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) by the macrodilution method. RESULTS: The water extract showed antimicrobial activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 300 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 300 mug/ml). The dichloromethane extract efficiently inhibited NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and NO production and exhibited significant antioxidant activity in the ORAC assay. An interesting activity was also found against S. pneumoniae (MIC: 200 mug/ml), S. aureus (MIC: 400 mug/ml) and S. pyogenes (MIC: 200 mug/ml). The phytochemical investigation of the dichloromethane extract afforded plumbagin, canaliculatin, ismailin, betulinic acid and 4-hydroxy-5-methyl-coumarin as the main constituents. Plumbagin and ismailin were found to be responsible for the main biological activities observed. CONCLUSIONS: These results may provide a rational support for the traditional use of Diospyros bipindensis stem bark in the treatment of respiratory disorders, since the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds isolated from the dichloromethane extract were also present in the traditional water extract.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug-resistant microbes associated with hospitalized community-acquired and healthcare-associated pneumonia: a multi-center study in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and healthcare-associated  pneumonia (HCAP) may be caused by potential antimicrobial drug-resistant (PADR) microbes. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidences and risk factors associated with PADR microbes observed in patients with pneumonia occurring outside the hospital setting in Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with CAP or HCAP admitted to six medical centers in the northern, central, and southern regions of Taiwan in 2007. The pathogens were evaluated by microbiological specimens within 72 hours after admission. The patients' comorbidities, pathogens, and outcomes were evaluated. The risk factors of PADR microbes were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The enrolled patients exhibited HCAP (n=713) and CAP (n=933). The pathogens associated with HCAP (n=383) and CAP (n=441) included Pseudomonas spp. (29%vs. 10%, p<0.001), Klebsiella spp. (24% vs. 25%, p=0.250), Escherichia coli (6% vs. 8%, p=0.369), Haemophilus influnezae (3% vs. 7%, p=0.041), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2% vs. 6%, p=0.003) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (8% vs. 4%, p=0.008). The core pathogens of CAP and HCAP differed among the three regions of Taiwan. PADR microbes, including Pseudomonas spp. (n=191), Acinetobacter spp. (n=41), MRSA (n=49) and cefotaxime- or ceftazidime-resistant Enterbacteriaceae (n=25), were isolated from 13% of patients with CAP and 23% of patients with HCAP. Previous hospitalization, and neoplastic and neurological diseases were significant risk factors for acquiring PADR microbes. CONCLUSION: PADR microbes were common in patients with HCAP and CAP in Taiwan. Broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting PADR microbes should be administered to patients who have undergone previous hospitalization and who exhibit neurological disorders and/or malignancies.
TI  - A five-year review of necrotising fasciitis in a tertiary referral unit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Necrotising fasciitis is a life-threatening illness that is often difficult to diagnose. Immediate debridement and intravenous antibiotic therapy are required to limit the spread of infection. This five-year audit aimed to review the number and outcomes of all cases of necrotising fasciitis admitted to a tertiary referral unit and to assess the validity of the Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotising Fasciitis (LRINEC) scoring system. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patient notes over the five-year period from October 2006 to October 2011 was undertaken. The LRINEC score was calculated for each patient to evaluate its usefulness. RESULTS: Overall, 15 patients were diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis. Three patients died. The median age of patients was 51.0 years (range: 34-76 years). There were no obvious predisposing factors in 8 cases but patients had a median of 2.0 co-morbidities. The most common infective agent, present in five patients, was Group A Streptococcus. Other monomicrobial agents included Group G Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Polymicrobial infections were less common than mono-microbial infections and two patients had a polymicrobial infection including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although the LRINEC scoring system identified 12 of the 15 patients as having a high or intermediate likelihood of necrotising fasciitis, 3 were classified as low likelihood. CONCLUSIONS: This limited case series strongly suggests that the LRINEC system is too insensitive for diagnosis.
TI  - [Vitreal surgery and etiological diagnosis of bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of vitreal surgery and the importance of etiological diagnosis in the treatment for bacterial endophthalmitis. METHODS: Retrospective series case study. 20 cases (20 eyes) of bacterial endophthalmitis that were treated in Peking Union Hospital were enrolled. 14 eyes were post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and 6 eyes were postoperative endophthalmitis. Twenty cases of aged 3 to 83 years [mean (40.5 +/- 23.9) years] were enrolled, including 12 male and 8 female patients. Pre-operative visual acuity: 2 cases were able to count fingers, 6 cases were able to perform hand movement, 11 cases had light perception, light projection were uncertain in all cases, and there was no light perception in 1 case. Hypopyon was seen in 13 eyes. Severe anterior chamber inflammatory reaction was seen in the other 7 eyes. The fundus could not be observed in all 20 eyes. B-Scan ultrasound examination indicated that all 20 eyes displayed moderate to severe vitreous opacity; proliferation and organization were apparent in 12 eyes, and retinal detachment in 2 eyes. Vitrectomy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were performed in 18 eyes, and only intravitreal injection of antibiotics was administered in the other 2 eyes. At the beginning of operation, vitreous fluids were smeared and Gram stained. To eyes that showed a positive result in Gram staining, 1 mg of Vancomycin was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (balanced salt solution, BSS) in the eyes. To eyes that showed a negative result in Gram staining, 2 mg or 4 mg of Ceftazidime was injected into the vitreous cavity or added in the perfusion fluid (BSS) in the eyes, respectively. Additionally, we examined the vitreous specimens and performed drug susceptibility testing of the bacteria cultured from the specimens. The antibiotics that the bacteria were susceptible to were chosen according to the drug sensitivity tests. The follow-up period is from 1 to 102 months (average 16.6 months). RESULTS: Thirteen eyes presented with a positive Gram staining result, and 3 eyes presented a negative result; the other 4 eyes were not infected. Bacteria were cultured in 15 eyes. The detection rate of pathogen was 75%. The result for 11 eyes was consistent with the smear results. The bacteria detected were Staphylococcus aureus in 3 eyes, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 eyes, and Bacillus spp in 2 eyes. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Plesiomonas, Pseudomonas cepacia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Loffi Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas fluorescens were detected in 1 eye. The remaining 5 eyes did not have bacterial growth. The intraocular infection of all 20 eyes was controlled, and the intraocular inflammation was relieved. The visual acuity was significantly elevated. Postoperative visual acuity achieved were >/= 0.3 in 4 eyes, 0.1 to 0.2 in 4 eyes, 0.02 to 0.09 in 6 eyes, CF in 2 eyes, HM in 3 eyes and LP in 1 eye. The retinas of 17 eyes were normal, but recurrent retinal detachment occurred in the other 3 eyes, postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Vitrectomy combined with antibiotics and intravitreal injection of antibiotics were an effective treatment of bacterial endophthalmitis. We obtained the vitreous fluid smears at the beginning of surgery to quickly and accurately obtain etiological diagnoses by Gram staining. It is crucial to use etiological diagnosis to choose the susceptible antibiotics.
TI  - [Adult hospital acquired pneumonia: a multicenter study on microbiology and clinical characteristics of patients from 9 Chinese cities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in China and to provide evidence for appropriate therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter study in 13 Chinese urban tertiary hospitals. All HAP cases diagnosed at respiratory general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) from August 2008 to December 2010 were studied. Epidemiological data, etiology and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were collected. Sputum or tracheal aspirate and blood cultures, Legionella antibodies and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. Bacteria to antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: A total of 610 cases of HAP were diagnosed during the study, with an overall incidence of 1.4% among 42 877 hospitalized patients, while the incidence was 0.9% (362/41 261) in respiratory general ward and 15.4% (248/1616) in RICU. 93.9% (573 cases) of patients had at least one underlying disease, and 91.0% (555 cases) had exposure to at least one antimicrobial agent within 90 days prior to HAP diagnosis. Pathogens were identified in 487 patients, with Acinetobacter baumannii [30.0% (183/610)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22.0% (134/610)], Staphylococcus aureus [13.4% (82/610)] and Klebsiella pneumonia [9.7% (59/610)] being the most common pathogens. Eighteen patients (3.0%) had infection with fastidious bacteria. A. baumannii and S. aureus were the more frequent pathogens in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cases [50.5% (97/192) and 21.4% (41/192)] as compared to non-VAP cases [20.6% (86/418) and 9.8% (41/418), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii and S. aureus were also frequent pathogens in cases with a score of more than 20 by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) scoring [45.7% (69/151) and 20.5% (31/151)], as compared to cases with a score of less than 20 of APACHE II [24.8% (114/459) and 11.1% (51/459), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii showed high resistance rates to carbapenems [more than 70% (109/142)], and the susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 40.8% (58/142), 99.3% (141/142) and 95.8% (136/142) respectively. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and imipenem were 48.8% (40/82) and 70.7% (58/82) respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 87.8% (43/49) in all strains of S. aureus. Mortality rate of VAP cases was 34.5% (61/177), significantly more than that of HAP patients [22.3% (135/605), P < 0.05]. The average hospital stay of patients with HAP was (23.8 +/- 20.5) days, significantly more than that of the average for inpatients [(13.2 +/- 13.6) days, P < 0.01] during the study period. Mean costs of HAP were (108 950 +/- 116 608) yuan, significantly higher than the average hospital costs of respiratory inpatients (17 999 +/- 33 364) yuan. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients hospitalized in urban tertiary medical centers, HAP incidence and mortality rate were high, which increased the patients' hospital stay and the medical costs. Common pathogens were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumonia. The common bacteria of HAP in China showed high resistance rates to antibiotics.
TI  - Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae: an emerging respiratory tract pathogen.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae a member of the Viridans  Streptococci, is known to be associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory tract infections (RTI). Very scanty information is available on the isolation of S. pseudopneumoniae from India. Hence, the present study was an attempt to isolate S. pseudopneumoniae from clinical samples and to study their drug resistance pattern. METHODS: Sputum samples (n=150) submitted to the microbiology laboratory for routine culture from patients clinically suspected to have lower respiratory tract infection were inoculated onto sheep blood agar and chocolate agar plates. Alpha haemolytic colonies were identified as S. pseudopneumoniae based on absence of capsule, bile solubility and optochin susceptibility in 5 per cent CO(2) and ambient air. Disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic susceptibilily testing. RESULTS: Among the samples screened, 4 per cent showed the growth of only S. pseudopneumoniae. Other pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans. All the S. pseudopneumoniae isolates were resistant to erythromycin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results showed presence of S. pseudopneumoniae in this part of the country and these were associated with RTI. Currently, most clinical laboratories report optochin susceptible isolates in 5 per cent CO(2) as S. pneumoniae and the resistant ones are not further tested for susceptibility in ambient air. As a result, S. pseudopneumoniae may be missed out. Hence, performance of at least two tests, viz. optochin susceptibility with incubation in 5 per cent CO(2) and ambient air along with bile solubility is necessary to differentiate S. pneumoniae from S. pseudopneumoniae.
TI  - Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) isolates in Namibia: implications for empirical antibiotic treatment of meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency associated with high mortality rates. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture is the "gold standard" for diagnosis of meningitis and it is important to establish the susceptibility of the causative microorganism to rationalize treatment. The Namibia Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) recommends initiation of empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with signs and symptoms of meningitis after taking a CSF sample for culture and sensitivity. The objective of this study was to assess the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of microorganisms isolated from CSF to antibiotics commonly used in the empirical treatment of suspected bacterial meningitis in Namibia. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study of routinely collected antibiotic susceptibility data from the Namibia Institute of Pathology (NIP) database. Results of CSF culture and sensitivity from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2012, from 33 state hospitals throughout Namibia were analysed. RESULTS: The most common pathogens isolated were Streptococcus species, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus, and Escherichia coli. The common isolates from CSF showed high resistance (34.3% -73.5%) to penicillin. Over one third (34.3%) of Streptococcus were resistance to penicillin which was higher than 24.8% resistance in the United States. Meningococci were susceptible to several antimicrobial agents including penicillin. The sensitivity to cephalosporins remained high for Streptococcus, Neisseria, E. coli and Haemophilus. The highest percentage of resistance to cephalosporins was seen among ESBL K. pneumoniae (n = 7, 71%-100%), other Klebsiella species (n = 7, 28%-80%), and Staphylococcus (n = 36, 25%-40%). CONCLUSIONS: The common organisms isolated from CSF were Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus, and E. coli. All common organisms isolated from CSF showed high sensitivity to cephalosporins used in the empirical treatment of meningitis. The resistance of the common isolates to penicillin is high. Most ESBL K. pneumoniae were isolated from CSF samples drawn from neonates and were found to be resistant to the antibiotics recommended in the Namibia STGs. Based on the above findings, it is recommended to use a combination of aminoglycoside and third-generation cephalosporin to treat non-ESBL Klebsiella isolates. Carbapenems (e.g., meropenem) and piperacillin/tazobactam should be considered for treating severely ill patients with suspected ESBL Klebsiella infection. Namibia should have a national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system for early detection of antibiotics that may no longer be effective in treating meningitis and other life-threatening infections due to resistance.
TI  - No change in antibiotic susceptibility patterns in the neonatal ICU over two decades.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify trends in early-onset sepsis and late-onset sepsis neonatal rates and to evaluate the appropriateness of the empirical antibiotic protocols. DESIGN: A 17-yr (1993-2009) analysis of positive blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. SETTING: The two neonatal ICUs at the Hadassah- Hebrew University Medical Center. RESULTS: During this period, 991 infants had at least one episode of either bacteremia or meningitis. The overall incidence of early-onset sepsis was 0.64 per 1,000 live births with a nonsignificant trend over the study period (p = 0.37). The overall incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the incidence rates (p = 0.021). The incidence of late-onset sepsis was 7.5 per 100 admissions with a significant positive trend in the prevalence rates (p = 0.021). The prevalence of early-onset group B Streptococcus bacteremia decreased significantly throughout the study period. Among late-onset sepsis, Gram-positive and fungi infection rates were stable over time, while Gram-negative infection rates showed a significant positive trend (p = 0.007). No significant change in the susceptibility rate of the isolated Gram-negative bacteria in late-onset sepsis for the common antibacterial drugs was found. About 85% and 90% of the isolated organisms were susceptible to our early-onset sepsis (ampicillin and gentamicin) and late-onset sepsis (vancomycin and cefotaxime) protocols, respectively, and these rates were stable over the study period (p = .1 and .55, respectively). Sepsis-related mortality was higher among Gram- negative sepsis cases resistant to our empiric antibiotic protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Our empiric antibiotic protocols are appropriate despite their continuous use over the last 17 yrs. This may have been achieved by the use of a controlled antibiotic program and infection control efforts.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute appendicitis and its implication for the use of prophylactic antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To prevent surgical site infection (SSI) after appendectomy, antibiotic prophylaxis has been recommended for all patients, but this approach is based largely on bacteriologic findings that are decades old. The objective of this study was to reevaluate the bacteriology of acute appendicitis in order to assess the usefulness of current antibiotic prophylaxis. METHODS: Between January 1 and December 31, 2010, 117 patients with pathology-proved acute appendicitis were recruited. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given according to national guidelines. Immediately after operation, the luminal contents of the appendices were swabbed for bacterial culture. The charts of the patients were surveyed retrospectively for postoperative complications until June 30, 2011. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 115 of 117 specimens sent for culture (98%). Of the 115 samples that yielded bacteria, all gave rise to aerobic isolates and five yielded mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates. The most common aerobic organism was Escherichia coli, which was present in 100 of 117 patients who had pathology-proved acute appendicitis (85%). Less frequent organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 cases; 26%), Streptococcus spp. (29 cases; 25%), Enterococcus spp. (21 cases; 18%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18 cases; 15%). All P. aeruginosa isolates were sensitive to amikacin, ceftazidime, and cefepime; but seven of the eight were resistant to cefuroxime. Eight patients were identified as having had a postoperative SSI, and P. aeruginosa was isolated from five of these cases. The isolation of P. aeruginosa correlated significantly with SSI (p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The most commonly identified aerobic bacteria associated with acute appendicitis were E. coli, followed by K. pneumoniae, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and P. aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently was not covered by the prophylactic antibiotics chosen and might be associated with SSI.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of black thyme (Thymbra spicata L.) essential oils.
AB  - In order to study antimicrobial effects of essential oils of Wild Thyme (Thymbra  spicata L.) on two Gram positive bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae RJTTC1978 and Staphylococcus aureus RJTTC1885) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli RJTTC2409 and Klebsiella pneumoniae RJTTC1097), the research carried out with five concentrations (0.2, 2, 4, 10 and 20 microl) using disk diffusion and microbroth dilution (to determine MIC and MBC) methods at Ilam University during 2010. Tetracycline and Gentamicin discs were used as control. Chemical composition of the EOs was analyzed by GC-MS. Antioxidant activity of the essential oils (EOs) was measured following DPPH assay. Results showed that Carvacrol (60.36%), gamma-Terpinene (15.09%), beta-Myrcene (2.15%), trans-Caryophyllene (1.78%) and alpha-Thujene (1.54%) were the main components of the oils. Evaluation of antimicrobial activity revealed that the oils were active against both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. However, the biggest growth inhibitory zone (33.34 +/- 0.5 mm) was recorded on Streptococcus agalactiae at 20 microl/ml concentration. The lowest MIC (3.12 microl/ml) observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae, while minimum MBC (6.25 microl/ml) recorded on Klebsiella pneumoniae. Radical-scavenging ability of the EOs and BHT ranged from 9.93 +/- 2.57 to 77.81 +/- 1.3% and 80.48 +/- 0.56 to 10.66 +/- 1.11%, respectively. The inhibiting effect of Thymbra oils was stronger than the synthetic BHT, particularly at lower concentrations, as IC50 concentration of EOs for the reduction of DPPH radicals was 1.28 microl/ml which was lower than IC50 calculated for BHT (1.31 microl/ml). The total phenolic content, determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, was 1.52 +/- 0.15 mg PyE/ml EOs.
TI  - A reflection on bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents at a major tertiary  care center in Lebanon over a decade.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has been inflecting deleterious health and economic consequences locally and globally. This study addresses the patterns and trends of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents over a decade, at a major tertiary care center in Beirut. METHODS: Data on bacterial susceptibility patterns at the CAP accredited Clinical Microbiology Laboratory is analyzed from January 2000 to November 2011, along with related different studies conducted during this period. RESULTS: Increasing rates of ESBL-producing isolates were noted for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Resistance to carbapenems remains problematic in Acinetobacter spp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and started emerging in E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Tigecycline and colistin maintained excellent activity against most ESBL and carbapenem resistant bacteria relevant to the treatment by these agents. Resistance to quinolones is being encountered in Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), though remaining relatively high, showed decreasing trends of resistance, while vancomycin maintain uniform activity. Rare and sporadic vancomycin resistant strains in enterococci are encountered. Macrolide and clindamycin increasing rates of resistance is noted in S. pneumoniae, group A streptococci, S. aureus, viridans streptococci and some others. CONCLUSION: Physicians should be aware of the local epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance to properly guide the initial therapy. These resistance problems can be attributed to uncontrolled use of antimicrobial agents, thus, highlighting the need for antimicrobial stewardship to curb this threat.
TI  - Aetiology of community-acquired neonatal sepsis in low and middle income countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: 99% of the approximate 1 million annual neonatal deaths from life-threatening invasive bacterial infections occur in developing countries, at least 50% of which are from home births or community settings. Data concerning aetiology of sepsis in these settings are necessary to inform targeted therapy and devise management guidelines. This review describes and analyses the bacterial aetiology of community-acquired neonatal sepsis in developing countries. METHODS: A search of Medline, Embase, Global Health and Web of Knowledge, limited to post-1980, found 27 relevant studies. Data on aetiology were extracted, tabulated and analysed along with data on incidence, risk factors, case fatality rates and antimicrobial sensitivity. RESULTS: The most prevalent pathogens overall were Staphylococcus aureus (14.9%), Escherichia coli (12.2%), and Klebsiella species (11.6%). However, variations were observed both between global regions and age-of-onset categories. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were most prevalent in Africa, while Klebsiella was highly prevalent in South-East Asia. A notably higher prevalence of Group B Streptococcus was present in neonates aged 7 days or less. The highest case fatality rates were recorded in South-East Asia. Klebsiella species showed highest antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: Data on community-acquired neonatal sepsis in developing countries are limited. Future research should focus on areas of high disease burden with relative paucity of data. Research into maternal and neonatal vaccination strategies and improved diagnostics is also needed. All of this could contribute to the formulation of community-based care packages, the implementation of which has significant potential to lower overall neonatal mortality and hence advance progress towards the attainment of Millennium Development Goal 4.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Novel carbapenem antibiotics for parenteral and oral applications: in vitro and in vivo activities of 2-aryl carbapenems and their pharmacokinetics in laboratory animals.
AB  - SM-295291 and SM-369926 are new parenteral 2-aryl carbapenems with strong activity against major causative pathogens of community-acquired infections such as methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strains), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including ciprofloxacin-resistant strains), with MIC(90)s of </= 1 mug/ml. Unlike tebipenem (MIC(50), 8 mug/ml), SM-295291 and SM-369926 had no activity against hospital pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC(50), >/= 128 mug/ml). The bactericidal activities of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren. The therapeutic efficacies of intravenous administrations of SM-295291 and SM-369926 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae were equal or superior to that of tebipenem and greater than that of cefditoren, respectively, reflecting their in vitro activities. SM-295291 and SM-369926 showed intravenous pharmacokinetics similar to those of meropenem in terms of half-life in monkeys (0.4 h) and were stable against human dehydropeptidase I. SM-368589 and SM-375769, which are medoxomil esters of SM-295291 and SM-369926, respectively, showed good oral bioavailability in rats, dogs, and monkeys (4.2 to 62.3%). Thus, 2-aryl carbapenems are promising candidates that show an ideal broad spectrum for the treatment of community-acquired infections, including infections caused by penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae, have low selective pressure on antipseudomonal carbapenem-resistant nosocomial pathogens, and allow parenteral, oral, and switch therapies.
TI  - Community-acquired neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries: efficacy of WHO's currently recommended antibiotics--systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the aetiology and antibiotic resistance patterns of community-acquired sepsis in developing countries in infants where no clear focus of infection is clinically identified. To estimate the likely efficacy of WHO's recommended treatment for infant sepsis. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature describing the aetiology of community-acquired neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries. Using meta-analytical methods, susceptibility was determined to the antibiotic combinations recommended by WHO: (1) benzylpenicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin, (2) chloramphenicol and benzylpenicillin, and (3) third-generation cephalosporins. RESULTS: 19 studies were identified from 13 countries, with over 4000 blood culture isolates. Among neonates, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli accounted for 55% (39-70%) of culture positive sepsis on weighted prevalence. In infants outside the neonatal period, the most prevalent pathogens were S aureus, E coli, Klebsiella spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Salmonella spp., which accounted for 59% (26-92%) of culture positive sepsis. For neonates, penicillin/gentamicin had comparable in vitro coverage to third-generation cephalosporins (57% vs. 56%). In older infants (1-12 months), in vitro susceptibility to penicillin/gentamicin, chloramphenicol/penicillin and third-generation cephalosporins was 63%, 47% and 64%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of community-acquired resistant sepsis-especially that caused by Klebsiella spp. and S aureus-is a serious global public health concern. In vitro susceptibility data suggest that third-generation cephalosporins are not more effective in treating sepsis than the currently recommended antibiotics, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin; however, with either regimen a significant proportion of bacteraemia is not covered. Revised recommendations for effective second-line antibiotics in neonatal and infant sepsis in developing countries are urgently needed.
TI  - Molecular structure, Normal Coordinate Analysis, harmonic vibrational frequencies, Natural Bond Orbital, TD-DFT calculations and biological activity analysis of antioxidant drug 7-hydroxycoumarin.
AB  - In this work, we report harmonic vibrational frequencies, molecular structure, NBO and HOMO, LUMO analysis of Umbelliferone also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin (7HC). The optimized geometric bond lengths and bond angles obtained by computation (monomer and dimmer) shows good agreement with experimental XRD data. Harmonic frequencies of 7HC were determined and analyzed by DFT utilizing 6-311+G(d,p) as basis set. The assignments of the vibrational spectra have been carried out with the help of Normal Coordinate Analysis (NCA) following the Scaled Quantum Mechanical Force Field Methodology (SQMFF). The change in electron density (ED) in the sigma* and pi* antibonding orbitals and stabilization energies E(2) have been calculated by Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis to give clear evidence of stabilization originating in the hyperconjugation of hydrogen-bonded interaction. The energy and oscillator strength calculated by Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) complements with the experimental findings. The simulated spectra satisfactorily coincides with the experimental spectra. Microbial activity of studied compounds was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Enterococcus faecalis.
TI  - Proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. The objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. METHOD: Bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. Proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an ELISA plate reader and zymography. RESULTS: We identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. Of these, six were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Corynebacterium, and Streptococcus bovis) and seven were Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Serratia marcescens) organisms. Two of these, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, are recognized wound pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. Matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.
TI  - A Five-year Review on the Etiology and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Pattern of Otitis Media Pathogens in Jordanian Children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the bacteriological agents of otitis media in Jordanian children and to assess the in vitro susceptibility of these isolates to commonly used antibiotics. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of consecutive samples submitted for microbiological evaluation from outpatients children aged between 6 months and 15 years who were clinically diagnosed with otitis media and were treated at Princess Rahma Hospital in North Jordan between January 2005 and December 2009. RESULTS: A total of 724 isolates were recovered from cultures obtained from 863 children patients giving an isolation rate of 83.8%. The male and female isolate ratio was (1.26:1.0). The most common bacterial species isolated were S. aureus (59.9%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.4%), Pseudomonas (7.7%), E. coli (5.9%), Klebsiella spp. (3.1%) and Proteus spp. (0.9%). The most of S. aureus isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (94.0%) and gentamicin (87.3%). Streptococcus organisms were susceptible in highest percentage to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (87.1%). Gram-negative isolates were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (83.5%) and gentamicin (79.8%). Among all isolates, vancomycin was the most effective antimicrobial agent with susceptibility rate of 83.9%, whereas cefixime showed the lowest susceptibility rate of 39.7%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus isolates were the most frequent bacteria isolated from otitis media and were highly sensitive to vancomycin and gentamicin, while gram-negative isolates were more sensitive to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - Immunity to the conserved influenza nucleoprotein reduces susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.
AB  - Influenza causes >250,000 deaths annually in the industrialized world, and bacterial infections frequently cause secondary illnesses during influenza outbreaks, including pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis media. In this study, we demonstrate that cross-reactive immunity to mismatched influenza strains can reduce susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections, even though this fails to prevent influenza infection. Specifically, infecting mice with H3N2 influenza before challenging with mismatched H1N1 influenza reduces susceptibility to either Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae or Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae. Vaccinating mice with the highly conserved nucleoprotein of influenza also reduces H1N1-induced susceptibility to lethal bacterial infections. Both T cells and Abs contribute to defense against influenza-induced bacterial diseases; influenza cross-reactive T cells reduce viral titers, whereas Abs to nucleoprotein suppress induction of inflammation in the lung. These findings suggest that nonneutralizing influenza vaccines that fail to prevent influenza infection may nevertheless protect the public from secondary bacterial diseases when neutralizing vaccines are not available.
TI  - High load of multi-drug resistant nosocomial neonatal pathogens carried by cockroaches in a neonatal intensive care unit at Tikur Anbessa specialized hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cockroaches have been described as potential vectors for various pathogens for decades; although studies from neonatal intensive care units are scarce. This study assessed the vector potential of cockroaches (identified as Blatella germanica) in a neonatal intensive care unit setup in Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 400 Blatella germanica roaches were aseptically collected for five consecutive months. Standard laboratory procedures were used to process the samples. RESULTS: From the external and gut homogenates, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Providencia rettgeri, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter aeruginosa, Salmonella C1, Non Group A streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter spp. and Shigella flexneri were isolated. Multi-drug resistance was seen in all organisms. Resistance to up to all the 12 antimicrobials tested was observed in different pathogens. CONCLUSION: Cockroaches could play a vector role for nosocomial infections in a neonatal intensive care unit and environmental control measures of these vectors is required to reduce the risk of infection. A high level of drug resistance pattern of the isolated pathogens was demonstrated.
TI  - Structure of a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum.
AB  - The crystal structure of an extremely thermostable UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UDP-GDH) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum islandicum was determined at a resolution of 2.0 A. The overall fold was comprised of an N-terminal NAD(+) dinucleotide binding domain and a C-terminal UDP-sugar binding domain connected by a long alpha-helix, and the main-chain coordinates of the enzyme were similar to those of previously studied UDP-GDHs, including the enzymes from Burkholderia cepacia, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. However, the sizes of several surface loops in P. islandicum UDP-GDH were much smaller than the corresponding loops in B. cepacia UDP-GDH but were comparable to those of the S. pyogenes and K. pneumoniae enzymes. Structural comparison revealed that the presence of extensive intersubunit hydrophobic interactions, as well as the formation of an intersubunit aromatic pair network, is likely to be the main factor contributing to the hyperthermostability of P. islandicum UDP-GDH.
TI  - Comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. By use of a sensitive enrichment broth, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the Referral Clinic in Eritrea and at a German University Hospital. In the German cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for Gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (n=8; MRSA (n=2)), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), Corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and Streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). In comparison, the Eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. Among the identified species were S. aureus (n=2), S. epidermidis (n=13), Streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and Gram-negative rods including Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), Enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), Escherichia coli (n=2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). Noteworthy, none of the Eritrean patients were positive for MRSA. In both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. However, we observed in two subjects of the Eritrean cohort co-colonization with S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the German cohort, whereas in the Eritrean cohort Gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. Continued surveillance of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.
TI  - Etiology and antimicrobial resistance of community-acquired pneumonia in adult patients in China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate antimicrobial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is mainly based on the distribution of etiology and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens. We performed a prospective observational study of adult with CAP in 36 hospitals in China. METHODS: Etiological pathogens were isolated in each of the centers, and all of the isolated pathogens were sent to Zhongshan Hospital for antimicrobial susceptibility tests using agar dilution. RESULTS: A total of 593 patients were enrolled in this study, and 242 strains of bacteria were isolated from 225 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (79/242, 32.6%) was the most frequently isolated pathogen, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (55/242, 22.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (25/242, 10.3%). Totally 527 patients underwent serological tests for atypical pathogens; Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae infections were identified in 205 (38.9%) and 60 (11.4%) patients respectively. Legionella pneumophila infections were identified in 4.0% (13/324) of patients. The non-susceptibility rate of isolated Streptococcus pneumoniae to erythromycin and penicillin was 63.2% and 19.1% respectively. Six patients died from the disease, the 30-day mortality rate was 1.1% (6/533). CONCLUSIONS: The top three bacteria responsible for CAP in Chinese adults were Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza and Klebsiella pneumonia. There was also a high prevalence of atypical pathogens and mixed pathogens. The resistance rates of the major isolated pathogens were relatively low except for the high prevalence of macrolide resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - [Necrotizing pneumonia - a rare complication].
AB  - Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of community-acquired pneumonia associated with destruction of the lung tissue during the infection and rise of necrotic foci in consolidated areas. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Nocardia, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common causative agents. Risk factors for developing necrotizing pneumonia include smoking, alcoholism, old age, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung diseases or liver disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing pneumonia requires supportive care, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and monitoring for sepsis and respiratory failure. Hemoptysis, abscess, empyema and gangrene are possible complications and surgical intervention may be required. The authors present a clinical case of pneumococcal necrotizing pneumonia in a patient without important risk factors and favourable progression with medical therapy. In this regard, a brief bibliographic review about this pathology is also made.
TI  - Maternal HIV infection and vertical transmission of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV-exposed newborns may be at higher risk of sepsis because of immune system aberrations, impaired maternal antibody transfer and altered exposure to pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis of a study (clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00136370) conducted between April 2004 and October 2007 in South Africa. We used propensity score matching to evaluate the association between maternal HIV infection and (1) vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens; (2) vertical transmission of pathogens to the newborn; and (3) sepsis within 3 days of birth (EOS) or between 4-28 days of life (LOS). RESULTS: Colonization with group B Streptococcus (17% vs 23%, P = .0002), Escherichia coli (47% vs 45%, P = .374), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7% vs 10%, P = .008) differed modestly between HIV-infected and uninfected women, as did vertical transmission rates. Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of neonatal EOS or LOS, although culture-confirmed EOS was >3 times higher among HIV-exposed infants (P = .05). When compared with HIV-unexposed, neonates, HIV-exposed, uninfected neonates (HEU) had a lower risk of EOS (20.6 vs 33.7 per 1000 births; P = .046) and similar rate of LOS (5.8 vs 4.1; P = .563). HIV-infected newborns had a higher risk than HEU of EOS (134 vs 21.5; P < .0001) and LOS (26.8 vs 5.6; P = .042). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HIV infection was not associated with increased risk of maternal bacterial colonization, vertical transmission, EOS, or LOS. HIV-infected neonates, however, were at increased risk of EOS and LOS.
TI  - Etiology of pneumonia in children in the absence of pneumococcal and antihaemophilus vaccines.
AB  - Childhood pneumonia represents an important pathology, a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Our study aims to determine etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children using several laboratory methods. We performed a prospective study that enrolled 560 children age 1 up to 18 years old all diagnosed with pneumonia by clinical and radiological features. We applied various laboratory methods (serologic, bacteriologic: bronchial aspirate, sputum, pleural effusion and blood culture) in order to identify a pathogen agent that caused pneumonia. Statistics used Statistical Package for Social Science. An etiology was established in 68.92% of all cases included in the study, as follows: in 33.93% viral etiology, in 25.13% we identified Streptococcus pneumoniae, in 20.2% Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8.29%, Staphylococcus aureus in 7.51%, Haemophilus influenzae in 4.92%. Mixed bacterial and viral infection was identified in 4.40% of all cases. A potential causative agent of childhood pneumonia was determined in most cases, S. pneumoniae being the main agent involved in community acquired childhood pneumonia in our country.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae cervical necrotizing fasciitis originating as an abscess.
AB  - Cervical necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive and devastating infection that is usually caused by a polymicrobial infection including group A Streptococcus and anaerobes. We present a case of a newly diagnosed diabetic man who underwent transoral drainage of a Klebsiella pneumoniae paraglottic abscess, which, despite culture-directed antibiotics, progressed to cervical necrotizing fasciitis with descending mediastinitis. The patient required 12 surgical debridements and sternotomy, but survived and was discharged on hospital day 40. To our knowledge, this is the first case of cervical necrotizing fasciitis caused by a K pneumoniae infection in the United States. The significance of this unusual presentation is discussed.
TI  - The changing profile of pediatric meningitis at a referral centre in Cape Town, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric meningitis remains a common cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Knowledge of the causative organisms in a region is of importance in guiding empiric antibiotic regimes and immunization schedules assisting decisions on primary health-care interventions. METHODS: This retrospective review of 557 meningitis cases represents a third pediatric survey conducted over a 3-year period (January 2007 to December 2009) at the same institution and after an interval of 14 years. Cases were identified using cerebrospinal fluid results. Demographic and laboratory variables were collected and meningitis was classified as aseptic/viral, bacterial, septic, tuberculous meningitis (TBM) or fungal. RESULTS: The commonest form of bacterial meningitis was TBM diagnosed in 22% (n = 126) of children. Streptococcus pneumoniae 4% (n = 23) and Klebsiella pneumoniae 3% (n = 17) were the next commonest causes of bacterial meningitis diagnosed. Haemophilus influenzae meningitis occurred in <1% (n = 3) of cases with a median age of 3 months. Aseptic meningitis remains the commonest category. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing was requested in 43% (n = 241) of cases; 8% (n = 46) were positive. CONCLUSION: TBM remains the commonest cause of pediatric bacterial meningitis in the Western Cape. It is concerning that the percentage of TBM cases out of the total study population has more than doubled compared with that in previous surveys. The low prevalence and young age of H. influenzae meningitis cases confirm the benefits derived from H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination.
TI  - Nickel chromium brackets and its effect on the oral microflora.
AB  - Nickel chromium brackets are the most common type of fixed orthodontic appliance  used in our environment and may alter the oral microflora. AIM: This study aimed to determine the effect of nickel chromium brackets in orthodontic treatment on the oral microflora and to compare with a control group of dental students. METHOD: Thirty-eight randomly selected participants were divided into two groups. Group 1 was 19 orthodontic patients (OS) with anterior segment crowding. Group 2 were 19 normal dental students (DS) who served as a control group. Two samples of stimulated saliva were collected. The initial sample was collected before the placement of nickel chromium brackets (OS1) and the other 6 months after wearing the appliance in both arches (OS2) for group 1. Group 2 also had the initial (DS1) and second samples (DS2) collected after a 6 month interval. The saliva was analysed after being inoculated onto blood, chocolate and MacConkey agar plates which were incubated for 24 hours at 37 degrees C aerobically except chocolate agar, which was incubated in a candle extinction jar. RESULTS: The results showed that Streptococcus viridans was the most prevalent microorganism and was isolated in 15 (79%), and 11 (57.9%), of groups OS1 and DS1 respectively. There was no statistical difference between both control groups OS1 and DS1 (p > 0.05), and treatment groups OS2 and DS2 for Streptococcus viridans. There was a significant difference between DS1 with 7(36.8%) and OS1 with 2 (10.5%) for Staphylococcus aureus (p < 0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae was cultured in all groups except OS2. There was also no statistically significant difference between groups OS1 and OS2 and the control groups DS1 and DS2 for all the organisms cultured. There was no change in composition of bacteria between groups OS1, OS2 and DS1. CONCLUSION: There is no difference in the oral microflora between orthodontic patients and normal subjects and wearing nickel chromium brackets does not significantly alter the composition of the oral microflora.
TI  - Epidemiology, aetiology and management of childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia in developing countries--a review.
AB  - Childhood acute community-acquired pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. In children who have not received prior antibiotic therapy, the main bacterial causes of clinical pneumonia in developing countries are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and the main viral cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but estimates of their relative importance vary in different settings. The only vaccines for the prevention of bacterial pneumonia (excluding vaccines for pertussis and measles) are Hib and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV). In children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, bacterial infection remains a major cause of pneumonia mortality; however, Pneumocystis jirovecii and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are important causes of pneumonia in them. Studies of bacterial aetiology of acute pneumonia in severely malnourished children have implicated Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae, with very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. Studies of neonatal sepsis suggest that Gram-negative enteric organisms, particularly Klebsiella spp., and Gram-positive organisms, mainly pneumococcus, group b Streptococcus and S. aureus are causes of neonatal pneumonia. Many of the developing countries that ranked high in pneumonia mortality are preparing to introduce new pneumonia vaccines with support from Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI Alliance), plan for the expansion of community-based case management and have ambitious plans for strengthening health systems. Assurance that these plans are implemented will require funding and continued public attention to pneumonia, which will help contribute to a substantial decline in childhood pneumonia deaths.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Surveillance Committee of Japanese Society of Chemotherapy, Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases, and Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology in 2009: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) started a survey in 2006. From 2009, JSC continued the survey in collaboration with the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases and the Japanese Society for Clinical Microbiology. The fourth-year survey was conducted during the period from January and April 2009 by the three societies. A total of 684 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 635 strains (130 Staphylococcus aureus, 127 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 4 Streptococcus pyogenes, 123 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 78 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 103 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A maximum of 45 antibacterial agents including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), four aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). Incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 58.5 %, and that of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) was 6.3 % and 0.0 %, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.1 % of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 18.7 % to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.7 % to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5 %) of beta-lactamase-producing strains has been suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2 %) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5 %) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9 %) suspected multi-drug resistant strains showing resistance against imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continuous national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - Evaluation of silicon oil on bacterial growth.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antimicrobial properties of silicon oil (Oleo de Silicone(R), Ophthalmos, Brazil) on in vitro bacterial growth of different microorganisms related to endophthalmitis. METHODS: The following microorganisms were analyzed: (1) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27583); (2) Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922); (3) Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923); (4) Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228); (5) Candida albicans (ATCC 10231); (6) Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883); and (7) Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 49619). The plates were incubated at 35 +/- 2 masculineC and its growth examined after 24 hours. An empty disk was placed in the center of each plate as a control. RESULTS: No inhibition halos were verified in any of the plates containing the four different concentrations of the bacterial inocula. CONCLUSIONS: The silicon oil 1000 cps does not have any effect on bacterial growth of any of the studied microorganisms.
TI  - Structures of Staphylococcus aureus peptide deformylase in complex with two classes of new inhibitors.
AB  - Peptide deformylase (PDF) catalyzes the removal of the formyl group from the N-terminal methionine residue in newly synthesized polypeptides, which is an essential process in bacteria. Four new inhibitors of PDF that belong to two different classes, hydroxamate/pseudopeptide compounds [PMT387 (7a) and PMT497] and reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds [PMT1039 (15e) and PMT1067], have been developed. These compounds inhibited the growth of several pathogens involved in respiratory-tract infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, and leading nosocomial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the range 0.1-0.8 mg ml(-1). Interestingly, the reverse-hydroxamate/nonpeptide compounds showed a 250-fold higher antimicrobial activity towards S. aureus, although the four compounds showed similar K(i) values against S. aureus PDF enzymes, with K(i) values in the 11-85 nM range. To provide a structural basis for the discovery of additional PDF inhibitors, the crystal structures of S. aureus PDF in complex with the four inhibitors were determined at resolutions of 1.90-2.30 A. The inhibitor-bound structures displayed distinct deviations depending on the inhibitor class. The distance between the Zn(2+) ion and the carbonyl O atom of the hydroxamate inhibitors (or the hydroxyl O atom of the reverse-hydroxamate inhibitors) appears to be correlated to S. aureus inhibition activity. The structural information reported in this study should aid in the discovery of new PDF inhibitors that can be used as novel antibacterial drugs.
TI  - Klebsiella-associated phagedenic ulcers in infants-a report of two cases.
AB  - Phagedenic ulcer is usually associated with infections due to staphylococcus, pseudomonas, streptococcus or fusospirochete in immunocompromised individuals. We report, for the first time, two cases of phagedenic ulcers in infants caused by Klebsiella pneumonia species.
TI  - Chemical composition of 8 eucalyptus species' essential oils and the evaluation of their antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1957, Tunisia introduced 117 species of Eucalyptus; they have been used as fire wood, for the production of mine wood and to fight erosion. Actually, Eucalyptus essential oil is traditionally used to treat respiratory tract disorders such as pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis. A few investigations were reported on the biological activities of Eucalyptus oils worldwide. In Tunisia, our previous works conducted in 2010 and 2011 had been the first reports to study the antibacterial activities against reference strains. At that time it was not possible to evaluate their antimicrobial activities against clinical bacterial strains and other pathogens such as virus and fungi. METHODS: The essential oils of eight Eucalyptus species harvested from the Jbel Abderrahman, Korbous (North East Tunisia) and Souinet arboreta (North of Tunisia) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion and microbroth dilution methods against seven bacterial isolates: Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the bactericidal, fungicidal and the antiviral activities of the tested oils were carried out. RESULTS: Twenty five components were identified by GC/FID and GC/MS. These components were used to correlate with the biological activities of the tested oils. The chemical principal component analysis identified three groups, each of them constituted a chemotype. According to the values of zone diameter and percentage of the inhibition (zdi, % I, respectively), four groups and subgroups of bacterial strains and three groups of fungal strains were characterized by their sensitivity levels to Eucalyptus oils. The cytotoxic effect and the antiviral activity varied significantly within Eucalyptus species oils. CONCLUSIONS: E. odorata showed the strongest activity against S. aureus, H. influenzae, S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and against all the tested fungal strains. In addition, E. odorata oil showed the most cytotoxic effect. However, the best antiviral activity appeared with E. bicostata. Virus pretreatment with E. bicostata essential oil showed better antiviral activity (IC(50) = 0.7 mg/ml, SI = 22.8) than cell-pretreatment (IC(50) = 4.8 mg/ml, SI = 3.33). The essential oil of E. astringens showed antiviral activity only when incubated with virus prior to cell infection. This activity was dose-dependent and the antiviral activity diminished with the decreasing essential oil concentration.

TI  - Recent trend of necrotizing fasciitis in Taiwan: focus on monomicrobial Klebsiella pneumoniae necrotizing fasciitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening soft-tissue infection that is traditionally caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) or mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria. Monomicrobial Klebsiella pneumoniae NF (KP-NF) has been reported since 1996 but has not yet been systematically studied. METHODS: We retrospectively studied consecutive NF cases treated at a university hospital in Taiwan during 1997-2010 and investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with monomicrobial KP-NF, using monomicrobial GAS-NF as a reference. We also analyzed the virulence gene profiles of the isolated K. pneumoniae strains. RESULTS: Of 134 NF cases, 88 were monomicrobial, of which the most common pathogens were GAS (n = 16) and K. pneumoniae (n = 15). Monomicrobial KP-NF entailed a moderate risk of limb loss (20% vs 25%; P = 1.000) and high mortality (47% vs 19%; P = .135), and it was more likely to involve bacteremia (80% vs 31%; P = .011), concomitant distant abscesses (27% vs 0%; P = .043), and underlying immunocompromising conditions (100% vs 63%; P = .018), compared with GAS-NF. The isolated K. pneumoniae strains (n = 10) were of capsular polysaccharides genotype K1 (n = 4), K54/K20/K5 (n = 4), K2 (n = 1), and K16 (n = 1). All strains carried rmpA, iucABCDiutA, and iroA. Genotype K1 strains had a significantly higher risk of concomitant distant abscesses, compared with non-K1 strains (75% vs 0%; P = .033). CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae has become a common pathogen of monomicrobial NF in Taiwan. Physicians treating patients with monomicrobial KP-NF should be aware of the risk of concomitant distant abscesses, particularly in cases caused by genotype K1.
TI  - Leptin and mucosal immunity.
AB  - Enhanced susceptibility to infection has long been recognized in children with congenital deficiency of leptin or its receptor. Studies in mice have demonstrated that leptin deficiency affects both the innate and acquired immune systems. Here, we review recent studies that demonstrate the impact on immunity of a common non-synonomous polymorphism of the leptin receptor. In a Bangladesh cohort of children, the presence of two copies of the ancestral Q223 allele was significantly associated with resistance to amebiasis. Children and mice with at least one copy of the leptin receptor 223R mutation were more susceptible to amebic colitis. Leptin signaling in the intestinal epithelium and downstream STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and SHP2 (Src homology phosphatase 2) signaling were required for protection in the murine model of amebic colitis. Murine models have also implicated leptin in protection from other infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Thus, the role of leptin signaling in infectious disease and specifically leptin-mediated protection of the intestinal epithelium will be the focus of this review.
TI  - [Dynamics of the main immunological indices in patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcers, complicated by hemorrhage].
AB  - A deep clinical, immunological, microbiological analysis was performed in patients, suffering gastroduodenal ulcer, complicated by hemorrhage. Immunodeficiency state with the signs of autoimmunization was noted in the patients. These changes were most severe in a severe blood loss, the local endoscopic hemostasis instability, high risk of the hemorrhage recurrence occurrence, presence in a periulcer zone mucosa of a conditionally pathogenic and pathogenic microflora with a Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus predominance. The analysis of the data obtained permits to prognosticate the pathologic process severity course and to improve the program of treatment.
TI  - Chemical inhibition of bacterial protein tyrosine phosphatase suppresses capsule  production.
AB  - Capsule polysaccharide is a major virulence factor for a wide range of bacterial  pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. The biosynthesis of Wzy-dependent capsules in both gram-negative and -positive bacteria is regulated by a system involving a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and a protein tyrosine kinase. However, how the system functions is still controversial. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen, the system is present in all but 2 of the 93 serotypes found to date. In order to study this regulation further, we performed a screen to find inhibitors of the phosphatase, CpsB. This led to the observation that a recently discovered marine sponge metabolite, fascioquinol E, inhibited CpsB phosphatase activity both in vitro and in vivo at concentrations that did not affect the growth of the bacteria. This inhibition resulted in decreased capsule synthesis in D39 and Type 1 S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, concentrations of Fascioquinol E that inhibited capsule also lead to increased attachment of pneumococci to a macrophage cell line, suggesting that this compound would inhibit the virulence of the pathogen. Interestingly, this compound also inhibited the phosphatase activity of the structurally unrelated gram-negative PTP, Wzb, which belongs to separate family of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Furthermore, incubation with Klebsiella pneumoniae, which contains a homologous phosphatase, resulted in decreased capsule synthesis. Taken together, these data provide evidence that PTPs are critical for Wzy-dependent capsule production across a spectrum of bacteria, and as such represents a valuable new molecular target for the development of anti-virulence antibacterials.
TI  - Gender and age-dependent etiology of community-acquired urinary tract infections.
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent community-acquired infections worldwide. Escherichia coli is the most common UTI pathogen although underlying host factors such as patients' age and gender may influence prevalence of causative agents. In this study, 61 273 consecutive urine samples received over a 22-month period from outpatients clinics of an urban area of north Italy underwent microbiological culture with subsequent bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of positive samples. A total of 13 820 uropathogens were isolated and their prevalence analyzed according to patient's gender and age group. Overall Escherichia coli accounted for 67.6% of all isolates, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.8%), Enterococcus faecalis (6.3%), Proteus mirabilis (5.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%). Data stratification according to both age and gender showed E. coli isolation rates to be lower in both males aged >/=60 years (52.2%), E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa being more prevalent in this group (11.6% and 7.8%, resp.), as well as in those aged </=14 years (51.3%) in whom P. mirabilis prevalence was found to be as high as 21.2%. Streptococcus agalactiae overall prevalence was found to be 2.3% although it was shown to occur most frequently in women aged between 15 and 59 years (4.1%). Susceptibility of E. coli to oral antimicrobial agents was demonstrated to be as follows: fosfomycin (72.9%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (72.9%), ciprofloxacin (76.8%), ampicillin (48.0%), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (77.5%). In conclusion, both patients' age and gender are significant factors in determining UTIs etiology; they can increase accuracy in defining the causative uropathogen as well as providing useful guidance to empiric treatment.
TI  - Reproducible discrimination between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy with infrared excitation.
AB  - The on time diagnostics of bacterial diseases is one of the essential steps in the foregoing treatment of such pathogens. Here we sought to present an easy to use and robust method for the discrimination between Gram-positive (Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacterial genera based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy. The robustness of our approach lies in the novel method for the production of the SER substrate based on silver nanoparticles and their subsequent re-crystallization in solutions containing high concentrations of chloride ions. The method presented here could be an interesting alternative both to commonly used histochemical approaches and commercial SERS substrates.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Sensitivities of major causative organisms isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis against various antibacterial agents: results of subanalysis based on the presence of menopause.
AB  - We investigated whether the presence of menopause influenced the species and distribution of causative bacteria isolated from patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis (the most common urinary tract infection), and we also investigated the sensitivity of the isolated species to antibacterial agents. Using multivariate analysis, we also investigated risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, because its frequency has increased and it is now a clinical problem in Japan. Six hundred and thirty-four strains were isolated from 489 premenopausal patients (mean age 32.3 +/- 10.1 years). Major causative bacteria detected were Escherichia coli (65.0 %), Enterococcus faecalis (12.0 %), Streptococcus agalactiae (5.5 %), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.6 %). From 501 postmenopausal patients (mean age 68.7 +/- 10.29 years), 657 strains were isolated, and the major causative bacteria detected were E. coli (61.5 %), E. faecalis (13.7 %), K. pneumoniae (5.2 %), and S. agalactiae (4.0 %). The sensitivities to fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cephems of E. coli isolated from premenopausal patients were both >/=90 %, while the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli isolated from postmenopausal patients were about 5 % lower. In regard to infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli (minimal inhibitory concentration of levofloxacin [LVFX] >/=4 mug/mL), significant risk factors were observed in patients with more than two episodes of cystitis within a year (p = 0.0002), patients to whom antibacterial agents were used previously for this episode of cystitis (p = 0.0175), and patients who had a history of FQ administration within 1 month. Although the species and distribution of causative bacteria of acute uncomplicated cystitis were the same regardless of the presence of menopause, the sensitivities to FQs of E. coli detected in postmenopausal patients were significantly lower than those in the premenopausal women. The major risk factors for infection with quinolone-resistant E. coli were a history of FQ administration and the morbidity of cystitis rather than the menopausal status. It was considered that taking an appropriate history including the morbidity of cystitis and history of FQ administration, and the appropriate selection of an antibacterial agent, would be important when empirical therapy is required.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Relationship between lactobacilli and opportunistic bacterial pathogens associated with vaginitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginitis, is an infectious inflammation of the vaginal mucosa, which sometimes involves the vulva. The balance of the vaginal flora is maintained by the Lactobacilli and its protective and probiotic role in treating and preventing vaginal infection by producing antagonizing compounds which are regarded as safe for humans. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective role of Lactobacilli against common bacterial opportunistic pathogens in vaginitis and study the effects of some antibiotics on Lactobacilli isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study (110) vaginal swabs were obtained from women suffering from vaginitis who admitted to Babylon Hospital of Maternity and Paediatrics in Babylon province, Iraq. The study involved the role of intrauterine device among married women with vaginitis and also involved isolation of opportunistic bacterial isolates among pregnant and non pregnant women. This study also involved studying probiotic role of Lactobacilli by production of some defense factors like hydrogen peroxide, bacteriocin, and lactic acid. RESULTS: Results revealed that a total of 130 bacterial isolates were obtained. Intrauterine device was a predisposing factor for vaginitis. The most common opportunistic bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All Lactobacilli were hydrogen peroxide producers while some isolates were bacteriocin producers that inhibited some of opportunistic pathogens (S. aureus, E. coli). Lactobacilli were sensitive to erythromycin while 93.3% of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin and (40%, 53.3%) of them were resistant to amoxicillin and gentamycin respectively. Results revealed that there was an inverse relationship between Lactobacilli presence and organisms causing vaginitis. This may be attributed to the production of defense factors by Lactobacilli. CONCLUSION: The types of antibiotics used to treat vaginitis must be very selective in order not to kill the beneficial bacteria (Lactobacilli) that help in preservation of vaginal health and ecosystem as being one of the probiotic bacteria.
TI  - LiF Reduces MICs of Antibiotics against Clinical Isolates of Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (LiF) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: Enterococcus faecalis, Staphyloccoccus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with LiF were performed by microdilution method. MICs were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. We observed reduced MICs of antibiotics associated with LiF ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. The strongest decreases of MICs observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with LiF against Acinetobacter baumannii and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against S. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against A. baumannii and S. pneumoniae. This suggests that LiF exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Microbial spectrum and resistance patterns in endophthalmitis: a 21-year (1988-2008) review in northeast United States.
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the microbial spectrum and antibacterial susceptibility of vitreous cultures in a tertiary referral center in Northeast United States. METHODS: All vitreous samples sent to the microbiology laboratory at a tertiary referral center from January 1988 to December 2008 were included in the study. The distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of all isolates from culture-positive samples were compared across 3 equal time periods 1988-1994, 1995-2001, and 2002-2008. RESULTS: One hundred forty-three positive cultures, where 11.9% (n=17) were polymicrobial, yielded a total of 160 isolates that consisted of 80.6% (n=129) gram-positive isolates, 12.5% (n=20) gram-negative isolates, and 6.9% (n=11) fungal isolates. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (37.5%, n=60), Viridans Streptococcus (11.3%, n=18), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6.9%, n=11). Other common gram-positive isolates include Propionibacterium acnes (5.6%, n=9), other Streptococcus species (4.4%, n=7), Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%, n=7), and Enterococcus faecalis (3.8%, n=6). The most common gram-negative isolates were Klebsiella species (3.1%, n=5), Moraxella species (3.1%, n=5), and Haemophilus species (2.5%, n=4). Vancomycin was effective against all CoNS, Sta. aureus, Viridans Streptococcus, and E. faecalis tested, and all Sta. aureus isolates were oxacillin sensitive. Of all CoNS isolates, 83.3% during 1988-1994, 73.1% during 1995-2001, and 100% during 2002-2008 were resistant to at least 1 of the antibiotics tested in the study with the last time period showing an increase in resistance (P=0.021, adjusted standard residual=2.0). CoNS showed a decreasing resistance over time to chloramphenicol and gentamicin (P=0.010, P=0.007, respectively) and an increase in resistance to penicillin and tetracycline during 2002-2008 (P=0.003, P=0.040, respectively). Susceptibility to other antibiotics did not show significant dependence on time. CONCLUSION: Bacteria causing endophthalmitis showed variable resistance to antibiotics over time. The importance of adequately treating endophthalmitis in the setting of these resistance pattern changes stresses the importance of periodic evaluation of causative organisms to ensure appropriate empiric treatment.
TI  - Bacterial flora concurrent with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of patients with upper gastrointestinal diseases.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the non-Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial flora concurrent with H. pylori infection. METHODS: A total of 103 gastric biopsy specimens from H. pylori positive patients were selected for bacterial culture. All the non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). RESULTS: A total of 201 non-H. pylori bacterial isolates were cultivated from 67 (65.0%) of the 103 gastric samples, including 153 isolates identified successfully at species level and 48 at genus level by MALDI-TOF MS. The dominant species were Streptococcus, Neisseria, Rothia and Staphylococcus, which differed from the predominantly acid resistant species reported previously in healthy volunteers. The prevalence of non-H. pylori bacteria was higher in non-ulcer dyspepsia group than in gastric ulcer group (100% vs 42.9%, P < 0.001). Six bacterial species with urease activity (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus aureus, Brevibacterium spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were also isolated. CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of the non-H. pylori bacteria concurrent with H. pylori infection, and the non-H. pylori bacteria may also play important as-yet-undiscovered roles in the pathogenesis of stomach disorders.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens isolated from adults in China during 2009 and 2010].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the drug-resistance rates of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens isolated from adults in China during 2009 and 2010. METHODS: A total of 1793 strains (S. aureus 421, S. pneumoniae 420, K. pneumoniae 404, H. influenzae 313, other Streptococcus. spp 149, and M. catarrhalis 86) of non-duplicated community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens were isolated from 11 hospitals in 6 cities. The MIC values were determined by the broth microdilution method, and the production of beta-lactamase was tested using a nitrocefin-based test. RESULTS: All of the S.aureus isolates were methicillin-sensitive (MSSA). Of the MSSA isolates, less than 1% (4/421) was resistant to beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, about 13.1% (55/421) and 9% (38/421) resistant to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and 57% (240/421), 53.2% (224/421), and 88.7% (373/421) resistant to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and penicillin, respectively. No S. aureus isolates resistant to vancomycin were detected in this study. Based on different criteria, the percentages of penicillin-sensitive S. pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 24.4% (102/420), 27.3% (115/420), 48.3% (203/420) (Oral) and 1.9% (8/420), 9% (38/420), 89.1% (374/420) (parenteral), respectively. The resistance rates of S. pneumonia to azithromycin, clarithromycin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin with clavulanic acid were 88.2% (370/420), 87.4% (367/420), 45.3% (190/420), 41.9% (176/420), 10.2% (43/420), and 5.2% (22/420), respectively. About 2.6% (11/420) and 0.2% (1/420) of S. pneumonia isolates were resistant to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. More than 70% (104/149) of beta-hemolytic streptococci isolates were resistant to azithromycin and clarithromycin, and about 10.1% (15/149) of isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. The resistance rates of K.pneumonia to most antibiotics were > 20% (81/404), and that of ceftazidime was lower than cefuroxime, cefaclor, and ceftriaxone. The mean prevalence value of ESBL producing K. pneumonia was 38.8% (157/404), with significantly regional variations. More than 90% of H. influenza and M. catarrhalis were susceptible to most antibiotics, with resistance rate of < 5% (16/313, H. influenza; 4/86, M. catarrhalis). The mean productions of beta-lactamase in H. influenza and M. catarrhalis were 13.1% (41/313) and 91.7% (79/86), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of PRSP increased significantly, and the resistance rates of community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens to common antibiotics such as macrolide and cephalosporins increased gradually. New fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin showed a high antimicrobial activity against most of the respiratory pathogens.
TI  - [Taxonomic characteristics and mixed communities of wound infection agents in patients of reanimation and surgical departments of a hospital].
AB  - AIM: Study of taxonomical structure ofwound infection agents, prevalence of mixes, and detection of character of their possible connection with the results of various microorganisms population interaction in septic wounds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microbiological study of material from patients with wound infection (WI), 582 of those were cured in reanimation and intensive therapy departments (RITD; group 1) and 1455 - in surgical departments (SD; group 2), was performed. Taxonomic membership and ability to coexist was determined in 4129 microorganisms strains. Etiological role of the agents was evaluated by using values of consistency rate (CR). Species that were present in more than 50% of samples were considered consistent, in 25 to 50%--additional, and in less than 25%--random. Frequency rates (FR) were also determined, that is the fraction of a certain species (genus) of the microorganism (in %) from all the isolated cultures that correspond to 100%. For the determination of the significance of individual species of the agent in the structure of mixed microorganism populations, FR - their fraction (%) in mixed population from the number of strains of this species that correspond to 100% - was calculated. RESULTS: A significant part of the microorganisms strains, more frequently in reanimation department (65.5%), caused wound suppuration in populations mixed with other species of the agents. In reanimation and surgical departments consistent species of wound infection agents were not detected. A leading etiological role of Staphylococcus aureus (FR 19.2% and 23.9%) was determined, and FR of S. aureus strains in mixes was 64.6% in RITD and 46.8% in SD. The parameters ofotheragents of WI in the comparison groups were similar. However FR among mixes in RITD were significantly higher for streptococci that do not belong to S. pyogenes species (72,5%), and also nonfermentative microorganisms (67,2%), and in SD - in Klebsiella pneumoniae mixes. For agents of wound infection especially in RITD, low species diversity was characteristic and the number of mixes variants is significantly higher. In RITD mixed infections develop more frequently, and the ecological community of microorganisms reaches higher values than in SD. CONCLUSION: During the analysis of microbiologi-cal data in RITD and SD general patterns and specific features of taxonomical structure, prevalence of mixed populations and character of their ecological community in wound infection was determined.
TI  - Effects of an immunomodulatory feed additive on the development of mastitis in a  mouse infection model using four bovine-origin isolates.
AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the ability of a commercially available feed additive (OmniGen-AF) to reduce mammary infections caused by a single strain of mastitic pathogens (Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and to examine the effects of the additive on markers of mammary immunity. Four experiments were completed using a murine model of bovine mastitis. Infection progression was examined using Sybr-green- and TaqMan-based quantitative PCR assays of 16S ribosomal DNA. Infection of the mammary gland with all pathogens caused rapid (24 to 48 h) appearance of pathogen DNA in mammary tissue. Provision of the feed additive for 2 weeks before infection significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the extent of pathogen DNA accumulation in models of S. uberis, E. coli and S. aureus infection. The additive was ineffective in reducing mammary infections caused by K. pneumoniae. We examined mechanisms of action of the additive through assessment of mammary concentrations of mammary myeloperoxidase (MPO), major histocompatibility complex 2 class II (MHC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP) messenger RNA (mRNA) concentrations and by examining serum complement C3 concentration. Infection of the mammary gland increased concentrations of MPO and MHC mRNAs (P < 0.05). Ability of the pathogen to elicit changes in mammary MPO and MHC gene expression was enhanced by the provision of the additive for 2 weeks before infection. These data imply that the additive increased the mammary inflammatory response and increased antigen presentation during a mammary infection. Value of the additive in preventing mastitis in cattle awaits additional studies using a bovine model and further evaluation of additional strains of the pathogens used in this study.
TI  - The use of multiplex real-time PCR improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. Knowledge of pathogens causing CAP constitutes the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. Previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time PCR as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of CAP (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila) in CAP patients attending Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA)/ Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia. Two previously developed multiplex real-time PCR assays, duplex for the differential detection of S. pneumoniae and B. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of CAP in blood and respiratory samples. Thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult CAP patients admitted to HTAA were analysed by multiplex real-time PCR assays and conventional methods. The microbial etiology of CAP could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of CAP patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time PCR. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by PCR alone), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), B. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by PCR alone and 17% by both culture and PCR), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), M. pneumoniae (6.5% - all by serology), C. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both PCR and serology), L. pneumophila (2.1% - all by PCR alone), Escherichia coli (4.3%). Haemophilus infuenzae, Acinetobacter lwoffii and Acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).
TI  - Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Necrotizing pneumonia: a rare complication of pneumonia requiring special consideration.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Necrotizing pneumonia is a rare complication of bacterial lung infection. Its cause is owing to either a virulence factor of the microorganism or a predisposing factor of the host. This disease may cause devastating complications such as diffuse pulmonary inflammation, septic shock, and respiratory failure, making treatment more difficult. In the recent decade, the cause of necrotizing pneumonia and the role of surgical treatment have raised considerable attention, leading to therapeutically specific suggestions. RECENT FINDINGS: Staphylococcus aureus strains that produce Panton-Valentine leukocidin have been reported to cause rapidly progressive necrosis of the lung tissue in young immunocompetent patients. Furthermore, recent studies have showed the risk of disease progression is associated with underlying medical conditions. Although antibiotics are the first choice of treatment for necrotizing pneumonia, it has been emphasized that surgical treatment is a feasible alternative option in patients who fail to respond to antibiotics and develop continued deterioration and complications. SUMMARY: The current knowledge of cause, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of necrotizing pneumonia are summarized. Antibiotics remain the mainstay of treatment. Lung resection can be considered an alternative treatment option in patients who are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy and develop parenchymal complications. Outcome is affected by the degree of disease progression and comorbidities.
TI  - A bioactive flavonoid from Pavetta crassipes K. Schum.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our continued search for bioactive compounds from plants, conscious effort is being made to rapidly analyze ethnobotanical plants used for treating various ailments by traditional healers before this information is irrevocably lost as societies advance and rural communities become urbanized. RESULTS: A compound isolated from the aqueous extract of Pavetta crassipes leaves showed activity against some pathogenic microorganisms which included Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium ulcerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli at a concentration < 50 mg/mL. The compound had minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration ranging from 12.5 to 25 mg/mL. The compound was identified using 1D and 2D NMR experiments and comparison with literature data as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside. CONCLUSIONS: This has supported the ethnomedicinal use of the plant, confirmed its activity, and has also provided an easy and simple method for isolating this compound which has a lot of pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications from a new source.
TI  - Complications of PORT-A-CATH(R) in patients with sickle cell disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red cell exchange/transfusion is frequently used in the management of patients with medical complications related to acute severe sickle cell disease (SCD). However, peripheral venous access is often difficult without central venous catheters (CVCs) in adult patients with moderate or severe SCD. AIMS: To review our experience with the use of the PORT-A-CATH((R)) device in sixteen patients with SCD undergoing exchange or simple transfusions. METHODS: Among a cohort of 550 patients who frequently visited the inpatient service, sixteen SCD patients required the insertion of a PORT-A-CATH((R)) device. These patients included 3 males and 13 females, aged 25-44 years [31.1 +/- 2.3; mean +/- SD]. A total of 24 PORT-A-CATH((R)) devices were implanted in these 16 patients during the study period. Eleven patients had 1 device implanted, three patients had 2 devices, one patient had 3 devices, and one patient had 4 devices implanted. RESULTS: Out of the 24 devices implanted, 17 required removal, due to either infection associated with sepsis and/or thrombosis. The organisms involved were Candida spp. (3), C. Parapsilosis (2), C. albicans (1), C. famata (1), C. lusitanice (1), Staphylococcus spp. (6), and S. aureus (3), as well as the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (2), alpha hemolytic Streptococcus (1), Diphtheroid bacilli (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Ps. Spp. (3), Escherichia coli (3), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella spp. (1), Serratia liquefaciens (1), Serratia fanticola (1), Achromobacter spp. (2) Chromobacterium violaceum (1), Delftia acidovirans (1), Stenotrophomonas maltophile (1), Alcaligenes faecalis (1), and Enterobacter cloacae (1). Two episodes of documented thrombosis were observed. One case presented with right atrial thrombosis/SVC syndrome and the other case presented with left upper arm thrombosis. Two patients died with ports in situ, while five patients had ports in place at the time of this study. The median working life of the ports was 688.5 days (range: 39-3925). The rate of infective complications was 2.63 infections per 1000 catheter days, and the number of infections was significantly correlated with the number of ports [Pearson's r=0.66; p<0.01]. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that patients with SCD suffer infective complications associated with the PORT-A-CATH((R)), which often necessitate its removal. Although these devices are extremely useful, their optimal beneficial potential is only realized if the patients receive proper care at special centers well-versed in the maintenance of such devices by experienced staff.
TI  - Efficacy of human simulated exposures of ceftaroline against phenotypically diverse Enterobacteriaceae isolates.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin, exhibits potent bactericidal activity against common Gram-negative pathogens, including Enterobacteriaceae, and Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a human simulated dose of ceftaroline fosamil against clinical Enterobacteriaceae in both neutropenic and immunocompetent mouse thigh infection models. Thirty-five Enterobacteriaceae isolates with ceftaroline MICs ranging from 0.25 to 32 mug/ml were selected for the neutropenic model, and five Escherichia coli isolates were also tested in the immunocompetent model. Two hours after inoculation, the ceftaroline fosamil human simulated regimen of 600 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 12 h was administered. The change in log(10) CFU after 24 h was compared to that in 0 h controls. The human simulated regimen produced predictable efficacy against 18 of 20 isolates with a MIC of </= 1 mug/ml. Similar efficacy was seen in the immunocompetent model against isolates with a MIC of </= 2 mug/ml, and enhanced efficacy was observed against the isolate with a MIC of 4 mug/ml. Human simulated exposures to ceftaroline fosamil at 600 mg every 12 h provided predictable efficacy against Enterobacteriaceae with MICs of </= 1 mug/ml and enhanced efficacy within the immunocompetent model, supporting the clinical utility of ceftaroline fosamil against these organisms.
TI  - [Development and use of test-systems for molecular-genetic detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents].
AB  - AIM: Search of new targets and improvements of molecular-genetic detection methods of species specific DNA fragments of out-of-hospital pneumonia (OP) infection agents in sputum. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Species specific oligonucleotide primers to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis were selected. 103 sputum samples from OP patients and 15 from practically healthy humans were test by using PCR and bacteriological method. RESULTS: Mixed bacterial flora was detected by bacteriologic method in OP in 26 cases (25.2%). 14 patients (13.6%) had B. catarrhalis DNA in sputum, 12 patients (11.6%)--S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae was detected in 11 examined individuals (10.7%), K. pneumoniae (7.9%)-- in 8. In 32 cases (30%) etiology of OP could not be deciphered bacteriologically. B. catarrhalis was detected in 19 (18.5%) of OP patients, S. pneumoniae--in 17 (16.5%), H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae--in 14.5% and 12.6% (15 and 13 patients) respectively by Using the developed PCR primers. In 16.5% cases (17 patients) positive results against several bacteria species simultaneously were obtained by PCR method, in 3.9% (4 patients) P. aeruginosa was detected. CONCLUSION. Use of PCR for detection of out-of-hospital pneumonia agents DNA significantly increases informativity of the study when compared with bacteriological method.

TI  - Escherichia coli Isolated from Urinary Tract Infections of Lebanese Patients between 2000 and 2009: Epidemiology and Profiles of Resistance.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the bacterial etiology of urinary tract infections in one of the busiest hospitals of Lebanon and to examine the epidemiologic and microbiologic properties of Escherichia coli isolated from urinary tract infections of Lebanese patients over a 10-year period. Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the data generated between 2000 and 2009 (10,013 Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria). Bacterial identification was based on standard culture and biochemical characteristics of isolates. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk diffusion method, and ESBL production was detected by synergy with third-generation cephalosporins and amoxiclav. Results. E. coli was the most frequent isolate throughout the ten years (60.64% of the total isolates). It was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus agalactiae. E. coli occurred more frequently in women (69.8%) than in men (61.4%). The lowest percentage of susceptibility of E. coli was manifested against piperacillin and ampicillin. An increase in the production of ESBL was observed (2.3% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2009). Conclusions. The etiology of urinary tract infections and their susceptibility profiles are important to be evaluated in countries like Lebanon where a severe misuse of antibiotics at all levels is observed.
TI  - Vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  - The study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  Presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. Moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. The aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). Bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. Bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, Pasteurella multocida, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli haemolyticus, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. No mycoplasmas were observed. The present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. Eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. During diestrus, E. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. Vaginal presence of Streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (P = 0.005). Therefore, Streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. Among the 12 antibiotics tested, Gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (P = 0.038). However, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. In conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.
TI  - [Epidemiology and clinical features in diabetic patients with invasive infections treated at the Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Iasi, Romania, between 2008-2010].
AB  - Infections in the diabetic population can be severe and life threatning at least  for two reasons: clinical signs are often torpid, masqued by chronical complications of diabetes leading to late recognition and medical adresability and also because of the inability to control established infection due to complex cell-mediated and humoral immunity deffects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the etiology, clinical features and outcome in diabetic patients with invazive disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted between January 2008 and December 2010 at The Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases Iasi among 75 diabetic patients with sepsis of microbiologically confirmed etiology (positive cultures from normally sterile sites) and sepsis with clinically suspected etiology (positive cultures from pus). Cases with positive urocultures and coprocultures only, were excluded. RESULTS: From 75 diabetics, 56% were males, 90,7% being over 50 years. Severe cases of sepsis (33/75, 44%) were associated more often with insulin-treated diabetes than non-insulin treated group (40% vs. 4%, p<0,005) probably because of multiple comorbidities associated as suggested by a high Charlson score (6,09 vs. 4,09, p<0,05). There were 64 cases with confirmed etiology and 11 cases with clinically suspected etiology. Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common agents isolated, being involved in 16 (21,3%) cases each, followed by coagulase negative Staphylococci (14/18,66%), Enterococcus spp.(6/8%), group B Streptococcus (3/4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Salmonella spp. (2/2,66% each), Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus equi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Sphyngomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis (1/1,33%). Multiple septic disseminations occured in 17(22,6%) cases and meningeal involvment was doccumented in 10(15,6%) cases. Meticillin resistance was noted in 53,3% for invasive isolates of S. aureus. Among 16 invazive strains of E. coli, 25% were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins, 17% to ciprofloxacin and 6,6% to aminoglycosides and colimycin. There were no E. coli strains resistant to imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam. The mean mortality rate was 14,66%. CONCLUSIONS: The high level of resistance of S. aureus and E. coli to commonly used antibiotics and meningeal involvement imposes a multidisciplinary approach of the diabetic patient. Proper knowledge of the pathogers involved in the potential invazive diseases is an important tool for successful treatment with appropriate empirical broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Different potency of bacterial antigens TLR2 and TLR4 ligands in stimulating mature mast cells to cysteinyl leukotriene synthesis.
AB  - The aim of study was to compare the potency of different bacterial antigens to induce rat mature mast cell to cysteinyl leukotriene (cysLT) generation. We examined Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 agonists, i.e. lipoteichoic acid (LTA) Staphylococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) Mycobacterium smegmatis, peptydoglican (PGN) Staphylococcus aureus, as well as TLR4 agonists, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Pophyromonas gingivalis and Escherichia coli. We also estimated the effect of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-6-, CCL5-, and IL-10-priming on mast cell cysLT synthesis following bacterial antigen activation. We found that all bacterial antigens activated mast cells to cysLT generation; however, the extent of cysLT release in response to stimulation varied. Out of the examined antigens LPS P. gingivalis exhibited the highest potency, as it induced cysLT generation acting at a very low concentration (10(-4) ng/mL). Other LPSs affected mast cells at higher (up to 10(5) -fold) concentrations. LTAs were the most effective at concentrations of 5 x 10(2) ng/mL, while LAM and PGN stimulated mast cells to maximal cysLT generation at concentrations as high as 10(5) ng/mL. Anti-TLR2 and anti-TLR4 antibodies, as well as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) inhibitor significantly diminished cysLT generation in response to bacterial antigen stimulation. Priming with TNF, IL-6 and CCL5 did not affect bacterial antigen-induced cysLT generation, while IL-10-pretreatment caused significant decrease in cysLT synthesis by mast cells. These observations might have a great pathophysiological importance; inasmuch cysLTs strongly influence the development and intensity of inflammation during bacterial infection.
TI  - Etiology of acute, non-malaria, febrile illnesses in Jayapura, northeastern Papua, Indonesia.
AB  - We conducted a prospective, inpatient fever study in malaria-endemic Papua, Indonesia to determine non-malaria fever etiologies. Investigations included malaria blood films, blood culture, paired serologic samples analysis for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, murine typhus, and spotted fever group rickettsia. During 1997-2000, 226 patients (127 males and 99 females) 1-80 years of age (median age = 25 years) were enrolled. Positive blood cultures (n = 34, 15%) were obtained for Salmonella Typhi (n = 13), Escherichia coli (n = 8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1). Twenty (8.8%) patients were positive for leptospirosis by polymerase chain reaction. Eighty (35.4%) of 226 patients had >/= 1 positive serology, diagnostic for 15 rickettsial and 9 dengue cases. Acid-fast bacilli-positive sputum was obtained from three patients. Most common confirmed (81 of 226, 35.8%)/suspected diagnoses were typhoid fever (n = 41), pneumonia (n = 29), leptospirosis (n = 28), urinary tract infections (n = 20), rickettsioses (n = 19), dengue (n = 17), and meningitis/encephalitis (n = 15). There were 17 deaths, 7 (46.7%) were caused by meningitis/encephalitis. Multiple positive serologic results and few confirmed diagnoses indicate the need for improved diagnostics.
TI  - Bronchoscopic findings in children with chronic wet cough.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as the presence of more than 4 weeks of chronic wet cough that resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy, in the absence of alternative diagnoses. The diagnosis of protracted bacterial bronchitis is not readily accepted within the pediatric community, however, and data on the incidence of bacterial bronchitis in children are deficient. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of bacterial bronchitis in children with chronic wet cough and to analyze their bronchoscopic findings. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of charts of children who presented with chronic wet cough, unresponsive to therapy, before referral to the pediatric pulmonary clinic. RESULTS: A total of 197 charts and bronchoscopy reports were analyzed. Of 109 children who were 0 to 3 years of age, 33 (30.3%) had laryngomalacia and/or tracheomalacia. The bronchoscopy showed purulent bronchitis in 56% (110) cases and nonpurulent bronchitis in 44% (87). The bronchoalveolar lavage bacterial cultures were positive in 46% (91) of the children and showed nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (49%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%), Moraxella catarrhalis (17%), Staphylococcus aureus (12%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1 patient. The chi(2) analysis demonstrated that positive bacterial cultures occurred more frequently in children with purulent bronchitis (74, 69.8%) than in children with nonpurulent bronchitis (19, 19.8%) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Children who present with chronic wet cough are often found to have evidence of purulent bronchitis on bronchoscopy. This finding is often indicative of a bacterial lower airway infection in these children.
TI  - In vitro potential of equine DEFA1 and eCATH1 as alternative antimicrobial drugs  in rhodococcosis treatment.
AB  - Rhodococcus equi, the causal agent of rhodococcosis, is a severe pathogen of foals but also of immunodeficient humans, causing bronchopneumonia. The pathogen is often found together with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus zooepidemicus in foals. Of great concern is the fact that some R. equi strains are already resistant to commonly used antibiotics. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro potential of two equine antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), eCATH1 and DEFA1, as new drugs against R. equi and its associated pathogens. The peptides led to growth inhibition and death of R. equi and S. zooepidemicus at low micromolar concentrations. Moreover, eCATH1 was able to inhibit growth of K. pneumoniae. Both peptides caused rapid disruption of the R. equi membrane, leading to cell lysis. Interestingly, eCATH1 had a synergic effect together with rifampin. Furthermore, eCATH1 was not cytotoxic against mammalian cells at bacteriolytic concentrations and maintained its high killing activity even at physiological salt concentrations. Our data suggest that equine AMPs, especially eCATH1, may be promising candidates for alternative drugs to control R. equi in mono- and coinfections.
TI  - A randomised, double-blind trial comparing ceftobiprole medocaril with ceftriaxone with or without linezolid for the treatment of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalisation.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a serious infection requiring hospitalisation in 20% of cases. The novel cephalosporin ceftobiprole has microbiological activity against the major bacterial pathogens causing CAP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). This was a multicentre, double-blind study in which 706 patients with CAP severe enough to require hospitalisation were randomised to ceftobiprole or to an expert-recommended course of ceftriaxone +/- linezolid (comparator group). Clinical and microbiological outcomes were determined 7-14 days after completion of therapy (test-of-cure visit). For the 469 clinically evaluable patients, cure rates were 86.6% vs. 87.4% for ceftobiprole and comparator, respectively [95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference, -6.9% to 5.3%]; in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of 638 CAP patients, these cure rates were 76.4% vs. 79.3%, respectively (95% CI of the difference, -9.3% to 3.6%). A typical bacterial pathogen was identified in 29% of the ITT population. Microbiological eradication rates in the 144 microbiologically evaluable patients were 88.2% and 90.8% for the respective treatment groups (95% CI of the difference, -12.6% to 7.5%). Both study drugs were well tolerated, with but a minority of patients requiring premature discontinuation due to an adverse event (6% in the ceftobiprole group and 4% in the comparator group). The overall incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the ceftobiprole group, primarily owing to differences in rates of self-limited nausea (7% vs. 2%) and vomiting (5% vs. 2%). In summary, ceftobiprole was non-inferior to the comparator (ceftriaxone +/- linezolid) in all clinical and microbiological analyses conducted, suggesting that ceftobiprole has a potential role in treating hospitalised patients with CAP.

Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of chinfloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of chinfloxacin, a novel fluoroquinolone, in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of chinfloxacin in systemic infection was evaluated in a mouse peritonitis model using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n = 3), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP; n = 1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 2), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (VSE; n = 1), vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VRE; n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 3) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 1), PRSP (n = 1) and K. pneumoniae (n = 2). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, chinfloxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA [50% effective dose (ED(50)) 2.28-4.15 mg/kg], MRSA (ED(50) 14.75 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) 6.20 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) 3.51-5.03 mg/kg), VSE (ED(50) 25.02 mg/kg), VRE (ED(50) 5.18-15.39 mg/kg), E. coli (ED(50) 1.25-1.90 mg/kg) and K. pneumoniae (ED(50) 2.92-8.28 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of chinfloxacin was generally similar to (P > 0.05) that of moxifloxacin, significantly higher (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05) than that of levofloxacin in Gram-positive isolate infections (MSSA, MRSA, PISP, PRSP, VSE and VRE), and less than that of levofloxacin against E. coli and K. pneumoniae infections (P < 0.01). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, chinfloxacin showed potent activity towards S. pneumoniae (higher than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin and similar to or higher than ciprofloxacin) infections. CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of chinfloxacin in vivo. The high efficacy of chinfloxacin in murine systemic and local infections warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - The microbiology of tonsils in khamis civil hospital, saudi arabia.
AB  - Objectives. Tonsillitis is a common infection in all age groups, especially under the age of five. Organisms causing this condition vary from place to place. Our aim is to find out the main causative agents of this condition in our hospital. Patients and Methods. Fifty-two consenting patients who needed tonsillectomy in Khamis civil hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between September 2006 and April 2007, were enrolled for the study. Swabs were taken from their inner surfaces and cultured for anaerobes and aerobes according to standard microbiological techniques. Results. Fifty-two patients, consisting of 30 males and 22 females were enrolled. Their mean age was 9.81 +/- 6.47. Nearly 65% of patients had positive cultures while 35% were negative. The commonest bacteria isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (44.1%); and Group B Streptococcus (35.3 %). Two Gram-negative bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae, (8.82%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.94 %), were also isolated. No anaerobe was isolated. Conclusion. Gram-positive cocci, consisting of Staphylococcus aureus and Group B Streptococcus (Streptococcus agalactiae), are the major causes of tonsillitis requiring surgery in our hospital. Antibiotic treatment of this condition should be directed largely against these organisms.
TI  - Trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 1,141), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in Taiwan. MICs of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2011). Among drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, all of the PRSP isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one MRSA isolate (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three VRE isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for ESBL-producing E. coli (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (MIC(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by FDA criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by EUCAST-2011 criteria. The susceptibility rate for A. baumannii (MIC(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. A bimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates. In Taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of A. baumannii.
TI  - Clinico-radiological features of subarachnoid hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted images in patients with meningitis.
AB  - AIM: To investigate the clinical and radiological features of meningitis with subarachnoid diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical features, laboratory data, and radiological findings, including the number and distribution of subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions and other radiological abnormalities, of 18 patients seen at five institutions were evaluated. RESULTS: The patients consisted of eight males and 10 females, whose ages ranged from 4 months to 82 years (median 65 years). Causative organisms were bacteria in 15 patients, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes. The remaining three were fungal meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. Subarachnoid DWI hyperintense lesions were multiple in 16 of the 18 cases (89%) and predominantly distributed around the frontal lobe in 16 of the 18 cases (89%). In addition to subarachnoid abnormality, subdural empyema, cerebral infarction, and intraventricular empyema were found in 50, 39, and 39%, respectively. Compared with paediatric patients, adult patients with bacterial meningitis tended to have poor prognoses (7/10 versus 1/5; p = 0.1). CONCLUSION: Both bacterial and fungal meningitis could cause subarachnoid hyperintensity on DWI, predominantly around the frontal lobe. This finding is often associated with poor prognosis in adult bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [The first experience of application of PCR techniques in real-time mode to diagnose bacteriemia during postoperational period in cardiosurgery patients].
AB  - The results comparison is made between PCR polymerase chain reaction techniques in real-time mode and cultural techniques of analysis of blood samples in patients with suspicion of bacteriemia during early postoperational period. From September to December 2009 43 blood samples from 37 adult patients aged 59+9.2 years were analyzed on suspicion of bacteriemia. The blood samples for PCR analysis (SeptiFast technique Roche diagnostics, Switzerland) were taken parallel to the inoculation. Among 43 samples 20 (46.5%) were positive. The species structure of identified germs was as follows: Enteroccocus Faecalis - 2, Klebsiella pneumonia - 2, Enteroccocusfaecium - 1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 2, coagulase negative Staphilococcus - 11. All cases of seeding of coagulase negative Staphilococcus were interpreted using PCR techniques as negative or contamination. In four cases a full matching of results of compared techniques was obtained. In cases when hemoculture was negative (n = 23) the PCR techniques permitted to detect two positive results (Staphilococcus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia). In three cases of positive hemoculture the PCR techniques brought negative result and at that in two cases the causative agents (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Ralstonia mannitolilytica) were out of specter of pathogens detected by this method. The PCR techniques in real-time mode permit to reduce significantly time of pathogen investigation and to detect the false positive results conditioned by contamination. This techniques has to be applied in parallel with cultural technique because only this approach provide a possibility to get the clinically needed data related to the sensitivity of causative agent to antibacterial preparations.
TI  - Multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli causing early neonatal sepsis in India.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the organisms causing early and late onset neonatal sepsis, with special reference to multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli, at two neonatal units (one urban, one rural) in India. METHODS: Prospective surveillance study. RESULTS: There were 159 episodes of sepsis (81 urban and 77 rural) affecting 158 babies. Gram negative bacilli caused 117 infections (68%) and predominated at both centres in both early and late sepsis. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest organism, causing 61 infections (38.3%). In early sepsis (0-2 days), non-fermenting gram negative bacilli caused 42.1% of infections at the urban centre; there were no cases of early Group B Streptococcus sepsis. Late onset sepsis was mainly caused by gram negative bacilli at both centres. Multi-drug resistance of over 80% of early-onset gram negative organisms to ampicillin, third generation cephalosporins and gentamicin indicates that these multi-resistant organisms are almost certainly circulating widely in the community. The overall mortality from early sepsis was 27.3% (9 of 33) and from late sepsis was 26.2% (33 of 126). Gram negative bacilli caused all deaths from early sepsis and 87.5% of deaths from late sepsis. CONCLUSION: This study shows that multi-drug resistant gram negative bacilli are a major cause of early and late neonatal sepsis in India and are almost certainly widespread in the community.
TI  - Pneumonia due to pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus and Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular serotype K16 in a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptoccocus, but no Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for bacterial coinfections during the 2009 and previous influenza pandemics. We hereby report a case with concurrent bacteremic pneumonia due to an unusual capsular serotype K16 K. pneumoniae and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer. Such a coinfection has not previously been described.
TI  - Structure of plantaricin locus of Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum 8P-A3 is a strain which is well known on the Russian pharmaceutical market and it is included in several probiotic products. The strain has been widely used since 1973 but the mechanisms of its antibacterial activity were unknown. L. plantarum 8P-A3 expressed high antagonistic activity against the wide range of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. DNA sequence analysis of L. plantarum 8P-A3 genome revealed the presence of a complete plantaricin locus of about 20,000 bp encoding genes of at least two bacteriocins--plantaricins EF and NC8. The plantaricin locus found in L. plantarum 8P-A3 is homologous to the plantaricin cluster in L. plantarum J51.
TI  - Bacterial colonization or infection in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - The aim of this study was the determination of bacteria present in maxillary and  ethmoid cavities in patients with chronic sinusitis and to correlate these findings with bacteria simultaneously present in their nasopharynx. The purpose of this correlation was to establish the role of bacteria found in chronically inflamed sinuses and to evaluate if the bacteria present colonized or infected sinus mucosa. Nasopharyngeal and sinus swabs of 65 patients that underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery were cultivated and at the same time the presence of leukocytes were determined in each swab. The most frequently found bacteria in nasopharynx were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Maxillary or ethmoidal sinus swabs yielded bacterial growth in 47 (72.31%) patients. The most frequently found bacteria in sinuses were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp. and Streptococci (pneumoniae, viridans and spp.). The insignificant number of leukocytes was present in each sinus and nasopharyngeal swab. Every published microbiology study of chronic sinusitis proved that sinus mucosa were colonized with bacteria and not infected, yet antibiotic therapy was discussed making no difference between infection and colonization. Chronic sinusitis should be considered a chronic inflammatory condition rather than bacterial infection, so routine antibiotic therapy should be avoided. Empiric antibiotic therapy should be prescribed only in cases when the acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis occurs and the antibiotics prescribed should aim the usual bacteria causing acute sinusitis. In case of therapy failure, antibiotics should be changed having in mind that under certain circumstances any bacteria colonizing sinus mucosa can cause acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
TI  - Biological activity of carbazole alkaloids and essential oil of Murraya koenigii  against antibiotic resistant microbes and cancer cell lines.
AB  - A total of three carbazole alkaloids and essential oil from the leaves of Murraya koenigii (Rutaceae) were obtained and examined for their effects on the growth of five antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria and three tumor cell lines (MCF-7, P 388 and Hela). The structures of these carbazoles were elucidated based on spectroscopy data and compared with literature data, hence, were identified as mahanine (1), mahanimbicine (2) and mahanimbine (3). The chemical constituents of the essential oil were identified using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS). These compounds exhibited potent inhibition against antibiotic resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (210P JTU), Psedomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 25619), Klebsiella pneumonia (SR1-TU), Escherchia coli (NI23 JTU) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SR16677-PRSP) with significant minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values (25.0-175.0 mg/mL) and minimum bacteriacidal concentrations (MBC) (100.0-500.0 mg/mL). The isolated compounds showed significant antitumor activity against MCF-7, Hela and P388 cell lines. Mahanimbine (3) and essential oil in particular showed potent antibacteria and cytotoxic effect with dose dependent trends (</=5.0 mug/mL). The findings from this investigation are the first report of carbazole alkaloids' potential against antibiotic resistant clinical bacteria, MCF-7 and P388 cell lines.
TI  - [Establishment of loop-mediated isothermal amplification technique for rapid detection of NDM-1 gene].
AB  - We established a rapid detection method of New Delhi Metallo-beta-Lactamase Gene  (NDM-1) based on Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP). With the application of LAMP, we designed four sets of LAMP premiers, using NDM-1 gene as the target sequence, and selected the set of optimal primers. Meanwhile, we established optimal reaction systems and conditions to carry out the sensitivity and specificity experiments. The experiment results showed that the whole detection process took only one hour and could be observed visually. In the experiment of sensitivity, NDM-1 gene had a detection limit of 6 copies in each reaction. In the experiment of specificity, we detected NDM-1 gene in 4 pathogen strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae), and the total DNA from intestinal microbes and the total DNA from soil microbes. We had not detected the amplification reactions. The detection method established could rapidly detect NDM-1 gene and visualize the experiment result. The method is easy to operate and has high sensitivity and specificity and thus has great application value in basic research laboratories, emergent detection and spot detection.
TI  - Investigation of the antibacterial activity of pioglitazone.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the antibacterial potential of pioglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinediones class of drugs, against Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. METHODS: Susceptibility testing was done using the antibiotic disk diffusion method and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of pioglitazone was measured according to the broth micro incubation standard method. RESULTS: Pioglitazone induced a dose-dependent antibacterial activity in which the optimal concentration was 80 muM. Furthermore, results indicated that while E. coli was sensitive (MIC = 31.25 +/- 3.87 mg/L) to pioglitazone-induced cytotoxicity, S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae were resistant (MIC = 62.5 +/- 3.77 mg/L and MIC = 62.5 +/- 4.14 mg/L, respectively). Moreover, pretreatment of bacteria with a suboptimal concentration of pioglitazone (40 muM) before adding amoxicillin, cephalexin, co-trimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin enhanced the antibacterial activity of all agents except co-trimoxazole. This enhancing effect was particularly seen against K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: These results indicate the possibility of a new and potentially important pioglitazone effect and the authors' ongoing studies aim to illustrate the mechanism(s) by which this antibacterial effect is induced.
TI  - Prevalence of uropathogens in diabetic patients and their corresponding resistance pattern: results of a survey conducted at diagnostic centers in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Urinary tract infection is the second most common clinical indication for empirical antibiotic treatment in primary and secondary health care settings. The incidence of diabetes mellitus throughout the world is increasing strikingly and in the long run, it has some major effects on the genitourinary system which makes diabetic patients more liable to urinary tract infection. This study is designed to reveal the distribution of uropathogens in diabetic patients according to age and sex, and corresponding resistance patterns. METHODS: A six-month retrospective review of urine culture assay data from August 2009 to January 2010 from randomly selected 85 patients who suffered from both urinary tract infection and diabetes was conducted. Relevant information was retrieved and analyzed statistically using Microsoft(R) Excel 2002 software. RESULTS: The study showed that females are more vulnerable to pathogenic attack than males throughout a wide age distribution. In terms of pathogenic distribution, Escherichia coli was the highest followed by Streptococcus sp., Acinetobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae and few others. Though Meropenem showed no resistance with E. coli, Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, in the case of Streptococcus sp. it exhibited resistance of 25%. Amikacin exhibited only 3% resistance with E. coli, whereas no resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and most interestingly showed 75% resistance with Streptococcus sp. Gentamicin exhibited no resistance with Acinetobacter while 26.9%, 50% and 87.5% resistance with E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus sp. respectively. Hence, Nitrofurantoin exhibited less resistance 11.9% compared to 12.5% resistance with E. coli and Streptococcus sp. Nitrofurantoin was highly prone to resistance with Acinetobacter and Klebsiella pneumoniae (100%, 50% respectively). Cephalosporins (cephradine, cefixime, ceftriaxone, cefepime etc.) showed moderate resistance (avg. 50%), whereas amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest resistance in all these cases. CONCLUSION: Pathogens are mostly resistant to antibiotics including amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cephalosporins and nitrofurantoin, with few exceptions including gentamicin, amikacin and meropenem.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine-5 -carboxylate derivatives.
AB  - In the present study, a new series of ethyl 2-(substituted benzylthio)-4-(3'-(ethoxycarbonyl)-biphenyl-4-yl)-6-methyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine- 5-carboxylate derivatives was synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by (1) H-NMR, mass and C, H, N analyses. All newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and antifungal (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Penicillium marneffei and Trichophyton mentagrophytes) activity. The results revealed that all synthesized compounds have a significant biological activity against the tested microorganisms. Compounds 8a, 8b, 8c, 8e, 8f, 8i, and 8j exhibited good antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of mastitis pathogens of dairy cattle and comparative relevance to humans.
AB  - Mastitis, inflammation of the mammary gland, can be caused by a wide range of organisms, including gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, mycoplasmas and algae. Many microbial species that are common causes of bovine mastitis, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus also occur as commensals or pathogens of humans whereas other causative species, such as Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae or Staphylococcus chromogenes, are almost exclusively found in animals. A wide range of molecular typing methods have been used in the past two decades to investigate the epidemiology of bovine mastitis at the subspecies level. These include comparative typing methods that are based on electrophoretic banding patterns, library typing methods that are based on the sequence of selected genes, virulence gene arrays and whole genome sequencing projects. The strain distribution of mastitis pathogens has been investigated within individual animals and across animals, herds, countries and host species, with consideration of the mammary gland, other animal or human body sites, and environmental sources. Molecular epidemiological studies have contributed considerably to our understanding of sources, transmission routes, and prognosis for many bovine mastitis pathogens and to our understanding of mechanisms of host-adaptation and disease causation. In this review, we summarize knowledge gleaned from two decades of molecular epidemiological studies of mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle and discuss aspects of comparative relevance to human medicine.
TI  - Rapid identification of bovine mastitis pathogens by high-resolution melt analysis of 16S rDNA sequences.
AB  - Accurate identification of mastitis pathogens is often compromised when using conventional culture-based methods. Here, we report a novel, rapid assay tested for speciation of bacterial mastitis pathogens using high-resolution melt analysis (HRMA) of 16S rDNA sequences. Real-time PCR amplification of 16S rRNA gene fragment, spanning the variable region V5 and V6 was performed with a resulting amplicon of 290bp. First, a library was generated of melt curves of 9 common pathogens that are implicated in bovine mastitis. Six of the isolates, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus and Mycoplasma bovis, were type strains while the other 3, Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Corynebacterium bovis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae, were bovine mastitis field isolates. Four of the type strains, E. coli, S. agalactiae, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus, were found to be of human origin, while the other 3 type strains were isolated from bovine infections. Secondly, the melt curves and corresponding amplicon sequences of A. pyogenes, E. coli, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, K. pneumoniae, S. uberis and S. aureus were compared with 10 bovine mastitis field isolates of each pathogen. Based on the distinct differences in melt curves and sequences between human and bovine isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, it was deemed necessary to select a set of bovine strains for these pathogens to be used as reference strains in the HRMA. Next, the HRMA was validated by three interpreters analyzing the differential clustering pattern of melt curves of 60 bacterial cultures obtained from mastitis milk samples. The three test interpreters were blinded to the culture and sequencing results of the isolates. Overall accuracy of the validation assay was 95% as there was difficulty in identifying the streptococci due to heterogeneity observed in the PCR amplicons of S. uberis. The present study revealed that broad-range real-time PCR with HRMA can be used as a powerful, fast and low-cost tool for the differentiation of clinically important bacterial mastitis pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of serial extracts from leaves of Aegle marmelos (Linn.).
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of serial petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol extracts from leaves of Aegle mawmelos were investigated against bacterial and fungal species. All the extracts exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with zones of inhibition ranging from 10 to 22 mm against bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aenrginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, fungi: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Aspergillusflavus. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentrations (MMC) of the extracts ranged from 1.25 to 10 mg/mL and 2.5 to 20 mg/mL respectively. Assessment of antibacterial efficacy of different extract revealed that Staphylococcus aureus, beta Streptococcus haemolyticus group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli showed high susceptibility to petroleum ether extract. Proteus mimrabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae showed high susceptibility to chloroform extract and Salmonella typhi showed high susceptibility to methanol extract. Petroleum ether extract exhibited the highest antifungal efficacy against all tested fungal species. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenols, sterols in petroleum ether and chloroform extracts, whereas tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, saponins and triterpenoids in methanol extract. The ability of the leaf extracts of Aegle manmelos to inhibit growth of bacteria and fungi is an indication of its broad spectrum antimicrobial activity which could be a potential source for development of novel bioactive antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Acute appendicitis due to both Klebsiella pneumoniae and serotype 35B Streptococcus pneumoniae, an emergent serotype].
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae has been rarely considered as an infectious agent in appendicitis. We report a case of a 47-year-old woman with acute appendicitis caused both by serotype 35B S. pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The pathway of the appendix colonisation remains unclear. It could be explain by direct infection via mucosal translocation or by hematogenous spread. Pneumococcal appendicitis could progress to perforation more frequently. The use of intraoperative samples for management of appendicitis is controversial. But, culture with appropriate media is the only mean to isolate bacteria not very often encountered in appendicitis and to identify species of epidemiologic interest as serotype 35B S. pneumoniae, a non vaccinal serotype resistant to penicillin which is considered as a potential emergent pathogen. In the case of S. pneumoniae appendicitis, it could be recommended to take complementary directed samples to understand its pathophysiology.
TI  - Differential effect of prior influenza infection on alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli: involvement of interferon-gamma production.
AB  - The influenza A virus is one of the main causes of respiratory infection. Although influenza virus infection alone can result in pneumonia, secondary bacterial infection combined with the virus is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, while influenza infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and Haemophilus influenzae, other bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae are not associated with influenza infection. The reason for this discrepancy is not known. In this study, it was found that prior influenza virus infection inhibits murine alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus but not of E. coli. Here, the mechanism for this inhibition is elucidated: prior influenza virus infection strongly increases interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) production. Furthermore, it was shown that IFN-gamma differentially affects alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of S. aureus and E. coli. The findings of the present study explain how influenza virus infection increases susceptibility to some bacteria, such as S. aureus, but not others, and provides evidence that IFN-gamma might be a promising target for protecting the human population from secondary bacterial infection by influenza.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Asia: report from the Community-Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection Pathogen Surveillance (CARTIPS) study, 2009-2010.
AB  - A multicentre resistance surveillance study [Community-Acquired Respiratory Tract Infection Pathogen Surveillance (CARTIPS)] investigating the susceptibilities of 2963 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Streptococcus spp. from Asia against 12 antimicrobial agents was undertaken from 2009 to 2010. Based on the breakpoints for oral penicillin V recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, the prevalence of penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PNSSP) ranged from 46% to 100%. Azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited variable resistance rates of 0-88% against S. pneumoniae, 0-57% against MSSA and 0-76.5% against Streptococcus spp. isolates. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae varied from 5.1% to 58.5%. beta-Lactamase production rates amongst H. influenzae isolates ranged from 15% to 46.6% and amongst M. catarrhalis isolates from 90% to 100%. Amongst M. catarrhalis isolates, macrolide resistance and cefaclor resistance rates of 5.8% and 1.2%, respectively, were found, mainly in Mainland China. Levofloxacin resistance rates of 0-3.9% with a MIC(90) (minimum inhibitory concentration causing inhibition of 90% of isolates) of 1-2mg/L and moxifloxacin resistance rates of 0-1.7% with a MIC(90) of 0.125-0.5mg/L were found amongst PNSSP isolates. Moxifloxacin was very active against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates, with MIC(90) values of 0.125-0.25, 0.032-0.5 and 0.064-0.125mg/L, respectively. These results from the CARTIPS study have confirmed some significant regional differences in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of S. pneumoniae, MSSA, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Streptococcus spp. and emphasise the importance of antimicrobial surveillance programmes for guiding empirical therapy and for focusing interventional control of antimicrobial resistance in distinct geographic areas.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2009 and March 2010].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2009 to March 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by P. aeruginosa and E. cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. ovatus, B. wadsworthia and B. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - [Microbiology of surgical site infections in abdominal tract surgery patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the microbiology of surgical infections after abdominal surgery can be of use when prescribing effective empirical antibiotic treatments. METHOD: Analysis of surgical infections after abdominal surgery in patients enrolled in the Prevalence of Infections in Spanish Hospitals (EPINE) corresponding to the years 1999-2006. RESULTS: During the period of the study, 2,280 patients who were subjected to upper or lower abdominal tract surgery were diagnosed with an infection at the surgical site (SSI). Eight hundred and eighty three patients (37%) had an operation of the upper abdominal tract (gastric, hepatobiliary, and pancreatic surgery) and 1,447 patients (63%) lower abdominal tract surgery (appendectomy and colon surgery). A total of 2,617 bacterial species were isolated in the 2,280 patients included in the analysis. The most frequent microorganisms isolated were, Escherichia coli (28%), Enterococcus spp. (15%), Streptococcus spp. (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5%, resistant to methicillin 2%). In the surgical infections after upper abdominal tract procedures, there were a higher proportion of isolations of staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp. CONCLUSION: The microbiology of SSI produced after upper abdominal tract surgery did not show any significant differences compared to those of the lower tract. However, more cases of SSI were detected due to staphylococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Candida albicans and less caused by Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium spp.
TI  - Synergistic and antagonistic effect of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  - The effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains on tyramine (TYR) and also other biogenic amines (BA) production by eight common food-borne pathogen (FBP) in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (TDB) was investigated by using a rapid HPLC method. Significant differences were observed among the FBP strains in ammonia (AMN) and BA production apart from tryptamine, histamine (HIS) and spermine formation (p<0.05). Salmonella paratyphi A was characterised as the main amine producer. LAB had an important synergetic role in some BA production by food-borne pathogenic bacteria, although the effect of some LAB strains on BA production was strain-dependent. Lactococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. resulted in significantly higher TYR accumulation by Aeromonas hydrophila and Enterococcus faecalis in TDB. The presence of Lactococcus and/or Lactobacillus in TDB significantly increased HIS production by A. hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Ent. faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas HIS accumulation was significantly reduced by Staphylococcus aureus, S. paratyphi A and Listeria monocytogenes.
TI  - Further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study 2009.
AB  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. In the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. RESULTS: Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin G-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant Enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium gradually increased to 29%. Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. Higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) isolates than in non-ICU isolates among the isolates from hospitals. Resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. CONCLUSION: Among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa further increased. The increase in imipenem resistance was slight in P. aeruginosa, but drastic in Acinetobacter spp. The problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among ICU isolates.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia to the macrolide antibiotics. METHODS: Inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. The data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. RESULTS: A total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. In general, there was less macrolide resistance in African than in Asian isolates. Most African studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in Streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most Chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. There was very little information available for Gram-negative organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in SSA remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against Salmonellae spp. in Asia. In urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. However, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.
TI  - Establishment of the first international repository for transfusion-relevant bacteria reference strains: ISBT working party transfusion-transmitted infectious diseases (WP-TTID), subgroup on bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still remains  a significant problem in transfusion with potential important clinical consequences, including death. The International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-Transmitted Infectious Diseases, Subgroup on Bacteria, organised an international study on Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria References to be used as a tool for development, validation and comparison of both bacterial screening and pathogen reduction methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four Bacteria References (Staphylococcus epidermidis PEI-B-06, Streptococcus pyogenes PEI-B-20, Klebsiella pneumoniae PEI-B-08 and Escherichia coli PEI-B-19) were selected regarding their ability to proliferate to high counts in PCs and distributed anonymised to 14 laboratories in 10 countries for identification, enumeration and bacterial proliferation in PCs after low spiking (0.3 and 0.03 CFU/ml), to simulate contamination occurring during blood donation. RESULTS: Bacteria References were correctly identified in 98% of all 52 identifications. S. pyogenes and E. coli grew in PCs in 11 out of 12 laboratories, and K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis replicated in all participating laboratories. The results of bacterial counts were very consistent between laboratories: the 95% confidence intervals were for S. epidermidis: 1.19-1.32 x 10(7) CFU/ml, S. pyogenes: 0.58-0.69 x 10(7) CFU/ml, K. pneumoniae: 18.71-20.26 x 10(7) CFU/ml and E. coli: 1.78-2.10 x 10(7) CFU/ml. CONCLUSION: The study was undertaken as a proof of principle with the aim to demonstrate (i) the quality, stability and suitability of the bacterial strains for low-titre spiking of blood components, (ii) the property of donor-independent proliferation in PCs, and (iii) their suitability for worldwide shipping of deep frozen, blinded pathogenic bacteria. These aims were successfully fulfilled. The WHO Expert Committee Biological Standardisation has approved the adoption of these four bacteria strains as the first Repository for Transfusion-Relevant Bacteria Reference Strains and, additionally, endorsed as a project the addition of six further bacteria strain preparations suitable for control of platelet contamination as the next step of enlargement of the repository.
TI  - Potential role of tigecycline in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Tigecycline is a member of the glycylcycline class of antimicrobials, which is structurally similar to the tetracycline class. It demonstrates potent in vitro activity against causative pathogens that are most frequently isolated in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), including (but not limited to) Streptococcus pneumoniae (both penicillin-sensitive and -resistant strains), Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase-producing strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 'atypical organisms' (namely Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila). Comparative randomized clinical trials to date performed in hospitalized patients receiving tigecycline 100 mg intravenous (IV) x 1 and then 50 mg IV twice daily thereafter have demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to the comparator agent. Major adverse effects were primarily gastrointestinal in nature. Tigecycline represents a parenteral monotherapy option in hospitalized patients with CABP (especially in patients unable to receive respiratory fluoroquinolones). However, alternate and/or additional therapies should be considered in patients with more severe forms of CABP in light of recent data of increased mortality in patients receiving tigecycline for other types of severe infection.
TI  - Clinical and economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia amongst adults in the Asia-Pacific region.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important cause of mortality and morbidity amongst adults in the Asia-Pacific region. Literature published between 1990 and May 2010 on the clinical and economic burden of CAP amongst adults in this region was reviewed. CAP is a significant health burden with significant economic impact in this region. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and advanced age were risk factors for CAP. Aetiological agents included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Staphylococcus aureus and atypical pathogens (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Legionella spp.), with important differences in the prevalence of these pathogens within the region. Antibiotic resistance was significant but was not linked to excess mortality. Aetiological pathogens remained susceptible to newer antimicrobial agents. Rational antibiotic use is essential for preventing resistance, and increased surveillance is required to identify future trends in incidence and aetiology and to drive treatment and prevention strategies.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial effects of polyphenolic compounds from olive mill wastewater.
AB  - Polyphenols or phenolic compounds are groups of secondary metabolites widely distributed in plants and found in olive mill wastewater (OMW). Phenolic compounds as well as OMW extracts were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Most of the tested phenols were not effective against the four bacterial strains when tested as single compounds at concentrations of up to 1000 mug mL(-1). Hydroxytyrosol at 400 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. Gallic acid was effective at 200, and 400 mug mL(-1) against S. aureus, and S. pyogenes, respectively, but not against the gram negative bacteria. An OMW fraction called AntiSolvent was obtained after the addition of ethanol to the crude OMW. HPLC analysis of AntiSolvent fraction revealed that this fraction contains mainly hydroxytyrosol (10.3%), verbascoside (7.4%), and tyrosol (2.6%). The combinations of AntiSolvent/gallic acid were tested using the low minimal inhibitory concentrations which revealed that 50/100-100/100 mug mL(-1) caused complete growth inhibition of the four strains. These results suggest that OMW specific fractions augmented with natural phenolic ingredients may be utilized as a source of bioactive compounds to control pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriology of deep neck abscesses: a retrospective review of 96 consecutive cases.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to review the microbiology of deep neck abscesses  and identify the factors that influence their occurrence. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was done of patients diagnosed with deep neck abscesses at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore between 2004 and 2009. The data of 131 deep neck abscess patients were reviewed, and those with positive pus culture were included in the study. Logistic regression was applied to analyse and compare the incidence of common organisms in various conditions (age, gender, aetiology and effects of diabetes mellitus). RESULTS: Of the 96 patients recruited, 18 had polymicrobial cultures. The leading pathogens cultured were Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae (27.1 percent), Streptococcus milleri group (SMG) bacteria (21.9 percent) and anaerobic bacteria-not otherwise specified (NOS) (20.8 percent). K. pneumoniae (50.0 percent) was over-represented in the diabetic group. SMG bacteria (68.8 percent) and anaerobic bacteria-NOS (43.8 percent) were most commonly isolated in patients with odontogenic infections. K. pneumoniae was found more commonly among female patients (39.3 percent). The distribution of the three leading pathogens between patients aged below 50 years and those 50 years and above was comparable. K. pneumoniae was the commonest organism cultured in parapharyngeal space abscesses, while the submandibular space and parotid space most commonly isolated SMG bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. CONCLUSION: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for treating deep neck abscesses. Empirical antibiotic coverage against K. pneumoniae infection in diabetic patients, and SMG and anaerobic bacteria in patients with an odontogenic infection, is advocated. Routine antibiotic coverage against Gram-negative bacteria is not paramount.
TI  - [Comparative studies on the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria between children with community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research was to explore the difference between children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the composition and antibiotic-resistance of pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: 241 CAP and 116 HAP with positive sputum culture who were hospitalized from January to December in 2008 in Children's Hospital Affiliated to Suzhou University were selected in this study. The bacteria were identified by traditionally manual method and antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed by K-B method. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used for statistical test. RESULTS: In 241 CAP, Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza accounted for (42.2%, 106/251) and (12.4%, 31/251) infection, respectively; however in 116 HAP, Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters accounted for (88.2%, 127/144). In addition, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus weren't isolated, however, its detection rate was 66.7% in HAP. The drug resistance was 1.5 times higher in HAP than that in CAP for several types of antibiotics, such as ceftazidime (37.5% (6/16) vs 75.6% (31/41)), cefepime (37.5% (6/16) vs 78.0% (32/41)), aztreonam (50.0% (8/16) vs 90.2% (37/41)), cefoperazone/sulbactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 51.2% (21/41)) and piperacillin/tazobactam (12.5% (2/16) vs 56.0% (23/41)). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from HAP had higher drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against some antibiotics, for example, gentamicin (0 vs 63.6% (7/11)), SMZ + TMP (20.0% (1/5) vs 63.6% (7/11)) and cefoperazone/sulbactam (0 vs 54.5% (6/11)). We also found Enterobacter cloacae isolated from HAP showed high drug resistance than that isolated from CAP against imipenem (0 vs 46.7% (7/15)), aztreonam (9.1% (1/11) vs 60.0% (9/15)) and cefoperazone (18.2% (2/11) vs 80.0% (12/15)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from HAP had higher resistance than that from CAP against gentamicin (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)), amikacin (0 vs 38.9% (7/18)), ceftazidime (0 vs 55.6% (10/18)), cefepime (0 vs 50.0% (9/18)) and cefoperazone (33.3% (2/6) vs 94.4% (17/18)). The detection rates of ESBLs for Escherichia coli were 84.6% (11/13) and 93.3% (14/15) in CAP and HAP, respectively (chi(2) = 0.553, P > 0.05); while for Klebsiella pneumoniae, they were 81.3% (13/16) and 95.1% (39/41), respectively (chi(2) = 2.767, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: CAP was mainly comprised of Streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenza; while HAP was mainly comprised of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters. The drug resistance of gram-negative bacilli was higher in HAP than that in CAP.
TI  - Comparative activity of tigecycline and tetracycline on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria revealed by a multicentre study in four North European countries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study involves a multicentre surveillance of tigecycline and tetracycline activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from primary care centres (PCCs), general hospital wards (GHWs) and intensive care units (ICUs) in Denmark (n = 9), Finland (n = 10), Norway (n = 7) and Sweden (n = 19). METHODS: The hospitals were each asked to test 30 consecutive Gram-positive and 30 Gram-negative clinical isolates. Supportive information accompanying each isolate included the study centre, ward level (PCC, GHW, or ICU), patient identification and source of the isolate. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tetracycline and tigecycline were determined with the Etest. RESULTS: The isolates collected comprised 1610 Gram-negative and 1767 Gram-positive clinical isolates. The study showed low rates of non-susceptibility (intermediate (I) and resistant (R)) to tigecycline: <1% in Escherichia coli, though other Enterobacteriaceae showed higher rates (Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9%) and Serratia spp. (23%)). The overall non-susceptibility rate for tigecycline in Enterobacteriaceae with species-related breakpoints for tigecycline was 6% (4% excluding Serratia spp.). The activity of tigecycline against Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. was high with a MIC(50) of 0.25 mg/l and MIC(90) of 1 mg/l. The prevalence of non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Gram-positive bacteria was <1%. The corresponding figure for tetracycline was 14%. The activity of tigecycline against Streptococcus pneumoniae was high with MIC(50) and MIC(90) of 0.125 mg/l. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline showed good overall in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates, including both tetracycline-susceptible and resistant isolates. Most non-susceptibility to tigecycline among Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli was I (6%), rather than R (<1%). This indicates a problem setting interpretive species-related tigecycline breakpoints for Enterobacteriaceae other than E. coli.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - [Trends of causative and antimicrobial resistant organisms among patients with hematological malignancies in Japan].
AB  
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant organisms in tertiary care hospital in Delhi, India.
AB  - Surveillance of multi drug resistant organisms in a health care setting is a necessity to have optimum treatment out come and less of treatment failures. Once any health care setting gets colonized with multi drug resistant organisms, it is very difficult to decontaminate the environment. On review of our data, for 12 months of year 2008 the prevalence of difficult to treat organisms with poor clinical outcome especially in ICUs have been identified. The need for surveillance, prescription auditing & computer assisted retrieval of data has been emphasized and discussed in detail with respect to various high quality samples like blood, urine, respiratory, pus and sterile body fluids. The prevalence of MRSA & VRE has been documented 30 to 40% and 10%, respectively. Over all prevalence of penicillin intermediate resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was found to be 9.52%. ESBL, AmpC, and Carbapenemase producing organisms were found to be 40 to 60%, 70 to 80% & 2 to 80% respectively in various multi drug resistant organisms like E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. 8% Pseudomonas spp. were found to be resistant to colistin in ICU samples. Enteric organisms were found to have high level ciprofloxacin resistant in 21.6% isolates, while S. paratyphi A isolation increased over a period of time. Yeast fungi isolated from blood predominantly were non-candida albicans (84.8%).
TI  - [Distributions and spreads of antimicrobial drug-resistant microorganisms in Saga prefecture].
AB  - We investigated the distribution of drug-resistant organisms to clarify transmission of the organisms. Drug-resistant organisms were surveyed in 12 facilities in 4 districts of Saga prefecture for 2 years, and were analyzed by beta-lactamase typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The number of isolates was 111,505 for the 2 years. Questionnaires for drug-resistant organisms revealed that Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 64.1% of S. aureus, penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) 60.1% of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistent Haemophilus inflluenzae (BLNAR) 19.4% of H. influenzae, Metallo-beta-Lactamase (MBL) 0.1% of gram-negative bacilli, multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) 0.6% of P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms 8.0% and 3.1% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. PFGE analysis of ESBL E. coli revealed that 33 isolates collected from 7 facilities in 3 districts belonged to the same one group, indicating that this strain is transferred between different hospitals in different saga districts. Investigations of distribution of drug-resistant organisms in not only each hospitals but also in the first and the second medical areas are important for controls of healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - Empyema thoracis: analysis of 150 cases from a tertiary care centre in North East India.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the clinical characteristics, microbiological profile, management, complications and outcome of cases with empyema thoracis. METHODS: All cases diagnosed as 'empyema thoracis' over a period from January 2006 through June 2010 were identified from the inpatient records and discharge summaries. Of the 160 cases identified, 150 cases were taken up for analysis and the rest 10 cases, of which two had significant predisposing co-morbidity and eight cases diagnosed as tubercular empyema thoracis were excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: Mean age of presentation was 4.74 +/- 3.53 years and two thirds of the children were under 5 years with male to female ratio of 1.42:1. Pus culture was positive in 32% (48 cases) with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the commonest organism isolated (31 cases, 64.6%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases, 22.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 cases, 6.3%), Haemophilus influenzae type b (2 cases, 4.2%) and Enterococcus (1 case, 2%). Clustering was seen in the hot and humid months from April to July (63.3%). Fever was the commonest presentation (96.7%) followed by cough (90%), breathing difficulty (66.7%), chest pain (26.7%) and pain abdomen (10.7%). Ampicillin and cloxacillin was used as the first line antibiotic in 57.3% cases. Average duration of intercostal water seal drainage (ICWSD) in situ was 13.5 +/- 8.05 days and 59 patients (39.3%) received fibrinolytic therapy. The commonest complications were collapse (18%), thickened pleura (16.7%), pericardial effusion (8%), cardiac tamponade (3.3%) and bronchopleural fistula (3.3%). Surgical procedures involved in this case series were decortication (14 cases, 9.3%), pericardiocentesis (5.3%), pericardiostomy (2.7%) and pericardiectomy (1.6%). Mortality was 3.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of empyema thoracis from the north eastern region of India. Streptococcus pneumoniae was found to be the leading cause of empyema thoracis in this case series. Conservative management with ICWSD and antibiotics or early use of fibrinolytic therapy if indicated are effective modalities of treatment.
TI  - Clinical features of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) in a Japanese community hospital: comparisons among nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP), HCAP other than NHAP, and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: More than 100000 Japanese die of pneumonia every year.  The number of people residing in nursing homes is increasing with the ageing of the population. In 2005, the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS/IDSA) published important guidelines for the management of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). In Japan, however, the optimum strategy for management of HCAP is still unclear. The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinical features of patients with HCAP. METHODS: Patients (n = 202) who were consecutively admitted with a diagnosis of acute pneumonia between October 2007 and September 2009 were retrospectively evaluated. Using the ATS/IDSA guidelines, patients were divided into three groups: a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) group (n = 123), a nursing home-acquired pneumonia (NHAP) group (n = 46) and a HCAP other than NHAP (O-HCAP) group (n = 33). These groups were then compared with respect to laboratory data, microbiological findings and mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality in the NHAP group (10.9%) tended to be higher than that in the CAP group (3.3%) or the O-HCAP group (0%). The pathogens most frequently identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae in the CAP group, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the NHAP group, and S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae in the O-HCAP group. CONCLUSIONS: The NHAP group was clinically different from the O-HCAP group, based on bacteriological examination and mortality rates. In order to accurately diagnose, and formulate optimum treatment strategies for Japanese patients, the categories of HCAP, as specified in the ATS/IDSA guidelines, should not be applied directly either to patients with NHAP or those with O-HCAP.
TI  - Assessment of an extraction protocol to detect the major mastitis-causing pathogens in bovine milk.
AB  - Despite all efforts to control its spread, mastitis remains the most costly disease for dairy farmers worldwide. One key component of better control of this disease is identification of the causative bacterial agent during udder infections in cows. Mastitis is complex, however, given the diversity of pathogens that must be identified. Development of a rapid and efficient bacterial species identification tool is thus necessary. This study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of bacterial DNA extraction for the automated molecular detection of major mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples to complement traditional microbiological identification. Extraction and detection procedures were designed and optimized to achieve detection in a respectable time frame, at a reasonable cost, and with a high throughput capacity. The following species were identified: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, and Klebsiella spp. (including Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae). The detection procedure includes specific genomic DNA amplification by multiplex PCR for each species, separation by capillary electrophoresis, and laser-assisted automated detection. The specificity of the primers was assessed with a panel of bacteria representing mastitis-negative control species. The extraction protocol comprised multiple steps, starting with centrifugation for fat removal, followed by heating in the presence of a cation exchange resin to trap divalent ions. The analytical sensitivity was 100 cfu/mL for milk samples spiked with Staph. aureus, Strep. dysgalactiae, and E. coli, with a tendency for K. pneumoniae. The detection limit was 500 cfu/mL for Strep. uberis and Strep. agalactiae. The overall diagnostic sensitivity (95.4%) and specificity (97.3%) were determined in a double-blind randomized assay by processing 172 clinical milk samples with microbiological characterization as the gold standard. When the physical nature of the milk samples was too altered, DNA purification with a magnetic bead-based system was used. Of the apparent false-positive samples, 5 were identified by specific microbiological analysis as true-positive Staph. aureus co-infections, with further confirmation by ribosomal 16S sequencing. The proposed methodology could, therefore, become an interesting tool for automated PCR detection of major mastitis pathogens in dairy cattle.
TI  - Comparative ceftaroline activity tested against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia: results from an international surveillance study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document the spectrum of activity of ceftaroline, the active form  of the prodrug, ceftaroline fosamil, a new cephalosporin with anti-methicillin-resistant staphylococcal activity, against a surveillance collection of clinical isolates obtained from the USA and Europe during 2008-09. METHODS: A selected group of species associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP; 6496 of 17 326 monitored strains) were tested for susceptibility in a central laboratory using CLSI broth microdilution methods. Organisms were sampled from 55 medical centres, 27 in the USA and 28 (12 countries) in Europe. Ceftaroline and comparator agents were tested and interpretations of MIC endpoints made by applying current CLSI (2010) and EUCAST (2010) breakpoint criteria. RESULTS: Against 1340 Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline inhibited all isolates at </=0.5 mg/L (MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.12 mg/L) and was 8-fold more active than ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 mg/L; only 79.2% coverage at EUCAST breakpoint). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 584; MIC(50/90), </=0.008/0.015 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 377; MIC(50/90), 0.03-0.06/0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 590; MIC(50/90), 0.5/1 mg/L) were very susceptible to ceftaroline, regardless of beta-lactamase production or multidrug resistance (MDR) patterns. The potency of ceftaroline against three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) was similar to that of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. Only modest differences in rates of ceftaroline susceptibility (breakpoint </=2 mg/L) were noted with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative Enterobacteriaceae strains between the USA and Europe (97.9% versus 97.0% for E. coli). Ceftaroline, like ceftriaxone, was not active against ceftazidime-resistant E. coli (10.2%-26.2% susceptible at </=2 mg/L) or K. pneumoniae (5.3%-11.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The ceftaroline surveillance for 2008-09 (USA and Europe) documented low MIC(50/90) values for S. aureus isolates at 0.5/1 and 0.25/1 mg/L, respectively. More importantly, ceftaroline MIC(90) results for S. pneumoniae (0.12 mg/L), H. influenzae (0.015 mg/L) and M. catarrhalis (0.12 mg/L) were very low, all MICs being </=0.5 mg/L. Ceftaroline exhibited promising high potency and wide coverage against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens known to cause CAP, especially isolates of MDR pneumococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - Sitafloxacin: in bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibacterial with in vitro activity against a  broad range of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including anaerobic bacteria, as well as against atypical pathogens. It is approved in Japan for use in a number of bacterial infections caused by sitafloxacin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, other Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Peptostreptococcus spp., Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Fusobacterium spp., Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In terms of clinical efficacy, oral sitafloxacin was noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or an infectious exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract disease, noninferior to oral tosufloxacin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and noninferior to oral levofloxacin in the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, according to the results of randomized, double-blind, multicentre, noninferiority trials. Noncomparative studies demonstrated the efficacy of oral sitafloxacin in otorhinolaryngological infections, urethritis in men, C. trachomatis-associated cervicitis in women and odontogenic infections. Gastrointestinal disorders and laboratory abnormalities were the most commonly occurring adverse reactions in patients receiving oral sitafloxacin. Adverse reactions reported in sitafloxacin recipients in the active comparator trials were of mild to moderate severity.
TI  - Ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal Salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("MAMEF").
AB  - Certain serovars of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. A rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. An innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF). We have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oriC locus common to all Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. We have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of Salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. Following lysis and DNA release, as little as 1 CFU of Salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. Furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oriC from Salmonella serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Paratyphi B, Paratyphi C, Typhimurium, Enteritidis and Choleraesuis but does not detect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Acinetobacter baumanii. We have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic Salmonella oriC oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with PBS. These pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect Salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).
TI  - Phytochemical screening and antibacterial activities of Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala (Asteraceae).
AB  - Some Vernonia species (Vernonia ambigua, Vernonia blumeoides and Vernonia oocephala) used in Northern Nigerian traditional medicine, were subjected to phytochemical screening using standard procedures. The antibacterial activity using the disc diffusion method as outlined by the NCCLS was carried out on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynbacterium ulcerans, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysentriae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas fluorescence. The results of the antibacterial activity as indicated by zone of growth inhibition ranged from 14 to 27 mm for the crude ethanol extracts and chloroform fractions of the Vernonia species being studied. The activity of chloroform fraction of V. blumeoides was higher on C. ulcerans and K. pneumoniae (27 mm), while the chloroform fractions of V. oocephala and V. ambigua were more active on P. mirabilis (27 mm) and S. typhi (22 mm), respectively. It is worth of mention that the chloroform fractions of the three Vernonia species demonstrated activity (20 mm) against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranged from 1.25-2.5 mg/mL for all the organisms tested. The MIC of 1.25 mg/mL exhibited by the chloroform fractions on both Gram positive and negative bacteria indicates broad spectrumactivity of the Vernonia species being studied. Phytochemical screening of the extracts/fractions revealed the presence of steroids/terpenes, saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides. The antibacterial activity exhibited in this study may be attributed to flavonoids, saponinss or sesquiterpene lactones. The overall results indicate that the extracts/fractions are potent antibacterial preparations at least in vitro. This lends credence to the use of these plants for the treatment of various infectious diseases.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess: an audit of 10 years' experience.
AB  - AIM: To describe our own experience with pyogenic liver abscesses over the past 10 years and investigate the risk factors associated with failure of initial percutaneous therapy. METHODS: A retrospective study of records of 63 PLA patients presenting between 1998 and 2008 to Australian tertiary referral centre, were reviewed. Amoebic and hydatid abscesses were excluded. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and microbiological characteristics, as well as surgical/radiological interventions, were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (42 males, 21 females) aged 65 (+/- 14) years [mean +/- (SD)] had prodromal symptoms for a median (interquartile range; IQR) of 7 (5-14) d. Only 59% of patients were febrile at presentation; however, the serum C-reactive protein was elevated in all 47 in whom it was measured. Liver function tests were non-specifically abnormal. 67% of patients had a solitary abscess, while 32% had > 3 abscesses with a median (IQR) diameter of 6.3 (4-9) cm. Causative organisms were: Streptococcus milleri 25%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 21%, and Escherichia coli 16%. A presumptive cryptogenic cause was most common (34%). Four patients died in this series: one from sepsis, two from advanced cancer, and one from acute myocardial infarction. The initial procedure was radiological aspiration +/- drainage in 54 and surgery in two patients. 17% underwent surgical management during their hospitalization. Serum hypoalbuminaemia [mean (95% CI): 32 (29-35) g/L vs 28 (25-31) g/L, P = 0.045] on presentation was found to be the only factor related to failure of initial percutaneous therapy on univariate analysis. CONCLUSION: PLA is a diagnostic challenge, because the presentation of this condition is non-specific. Intravenous antibiotics and radiological drainage in the first instance allows resolution of most PLAs; However, a small proportion of patients still require surgical drainage.
TI  - Hydroalcoholic extract based-ointment from Punica granatum L. peels with enhanced in vivo healing potential on dermal wounds.
AB  - The present study reports for the first time, the in vivo wound healing potential of Punica granatum L. peels. A 5% (w/w) methanolic extract based-ointment was formulated and evaluated for its wound healing in guinea pigs. The ointment was applied in vivo on the paravertebral area of twelve excised wounded models once a day for 10 consecutive days. The ointment significantly enhanced the wound contraction and the period of epithelialization as assessed by the mechanical (contraction rate, tensile strength), the biochemical (increasing of collagen, DNA and proteins synthesis) and the histopathological characteristics. Such investigation was encouraged by the efficiency of the methanolic extract as antimicrobial and antioxidant. Indeed, the extract showed antioxidant activity as strong as natural and synthetic compounds (Trolox, BHA, Quercetin). Furthermore, the extract exhibited significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all tested bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and fungi Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Trichopyton rubrum and Aspergillus niger. The formulated ointment might well find use as skin repair agent without hazard to human health based on these results and on the fact that it has been well established that the extracts of pomegranate used in conditions similar to those applied by traditional medicine, showed no toxic effects.
TI  - Plasma concentrations resulting from florfenicol preparations given to pigs in their drinking water.
AB  - Florfenicol administered through the drinking water has been recommended as a metaphylactic antibacterial drug to control outbreaks of respiratory diseases in pigs caused by strains of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae and Pasteurella multocida, yet it is difficult to pinpoint in practice when the drug is given metaphylactically or therapeutically. Further, pigs are likely to reject florfenicol-medicated water, and plasma concentrations of the drug are likely to be marginal for diseases caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The reported minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for these organisms show a breakpoint of 2 to 3 mug/mL. An experiment was conducted during September and October 2009. One hundred twenty healthy crossbred pigs (Landrace-Yorkshire), weighing 23 +/- 6.2 kg, were used in this trial. They were randomly assigned to 5 groups, with 3 replicates of 8 animals/group. Two commercial preparations of florfenicol were administered through the drinking water at 2 concentrations (0.01 and 0.015%). Water intake was measured before and after medication, and plasma concentrations of florfenicol were determined by HPLC. Considerable rejection of florfenicol-medicated water was observed. However, plasma florfenicol concentrations were of a range sufficient for a methaphylaxis approach to preventing disease by bacteria, with MIC breakpoints of </= 0.25 mug/mL. Decreased efficacy as a metaphylactic medication should be expected for bacteria with MIC >0.25 mug/mL, considering the reported existence of bacteria resistant to florfenicol and the natural resistance of Streptococcus suis or E. coli to this drug.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activities of Terminalia stenostachya and Terminalia  spinosa.
AB  - Plants that belong to the Combretaceae family have long history of use in the traditional medicine systems of Africa and Asia for treatment of diseases and conditions associated with HIV/AIDS-opportunistic infections. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological activities of extracts of Terminalia stenostachya Engl. & Diels and Terminalia spinosa Engl. (Combretaceae), to verify the rationale for their use by traditional health practitioners in the treatment of HIV/AIDS patients in Tanzania. Extracts of the leaves, stem barks and roots of T. stenostachya and extracts of stem barks and roots of T. spinosa have all shown strong activity against a number of standard microbial strains including Mycobacterium madagascariense and Mycobacterium indicus pranii, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Pseuodomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. All extracts from the two plant species showed strong antimycobacterial activity against test organisms. The stem and root bark extracts were more active than leaves against both gram positive and negative bacteria. With the exception of two extracts from stem barks of T. spinosa, all other extracts from T. stenostachya and T. spinosa that were tested exhibited less activity against brine shrimp larvae with LC50 values >/= 100 mug/mL compared to cyclophosphamide, a standard anticancer drug. These results provide an indication that these plants may possess therapeutically potent antimicrobial compounds worth further development.
TI  - Development of conventional and real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection  of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are major clinical threats to hospitalised patients and represent an important source of morbidity and mortality. It is necessary to develop rapid detection assays of nosocomial pathogens for better prognosis and initiation of antimicrobial therapy in patients. In this study, we present the development of molecular methods for the detection of six common nosocomial pathogens including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. Conventional multiplex PCR and SYBR Green based real time PCR assays were performed using genus and species specific primers. Blind testing with 300 clinical samples was also carried out. The two assays were found to be sensitive and specific. Eubacterial PCR assay exhibited positive results for 46 clinical isolates from which 43 samples were detected by real time PCR assay. The sensitivity of the assay is about 93.7% in blind test isolates. The PCR results were reconfirmed using the conventional culture method. This assay has the potential to be a rapid, accurate and highly sensitive molecular diagnostic tool for simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. This assay has the potential to detect nosocomial pathogens within 5 to 6 hours, helping to initiate infection control measures and appropriate treatment in paediatric and elderly (old aged) patients, pre-and post surgery patients and organ transplant patients and thus reduces their hospitalization duration.
TI  - Streptococcus mutans GlnK protein: an unusual PII family member.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacterium present in the oral cavity, and is considered to be one of the leading causes of dental caries. S. mutans has a glnK gene, which codes for a PII-like protein that is possibly involved in the integration of carbon, nitrogen and energy metabolism in several organisms. To characterize the GlnK protein of S. mutans, the glnK gene was amplified by PCR, and cloned into the expression vectors pET29a(+) and pET28b(+). The native GlnK-Sm was purified by anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) and affinity (Hi-Trap Heparin) chromatography. The GlnK-His-Sm protein was purified using a Hi-Trap Chelating-Ni2+ column. The molecular mass of the GlnK-His-Sm proteins was 85 kDa as determined by gel filtration, indicating that this protein is a hexamer in solution. The GlnK-His-Sm protein is not uridylylated by the Escherichia coli GlnD protein. The activities of the GlnK-Sm and GlnK-His-Sm proteins were assayed in E. coli constitutively expressing the Klebsiella pneumoniae nifLA operon. In K. pneumoniae, NifL inhibits NifA activity in the presence of high ammonium levels and the GlnK protein is required to reduce the inhibition of NifL in the presence of low ammonium levels. The GlnK-Sm protein was unable to reduce NifL inhibition of NifA protein. Surprisingly, the GlnK-His-Sm protein was able to partially reduce NifL inhibition of the NifA protein under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a manner similar to the GlnK protein of E. coli. These results suggested that S. mutans GlnK is functionally different from E. coli PII proteins.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2008: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory pathogens collected from patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted a third year of nationwide surveillance during the period from January to April 2008. A total of 1,097 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable with 987 strains (189 Staphylococcus aureus, 211 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 187 Haemophilus influenzae, 106 Moraxella catarrhalis, 126 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 162 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including a ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was as high as 59.8%, and those of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 35.5 and 11.8%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 13.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 26.7% to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 5.3% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. A high frequency (76.5%) of beta-lactamase-producing strains was suspected in Moraxella catarrhalis isolates. Four (3.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae were found among 126 strains. Four isolates (2.5%) of P. aeruginosa were found to be metallo beta-lactamase-producing strains, including three (1.9%) suspected multidrug-resistant strains showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. Continual national surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility of respiratory pathogens is crucial in order to monitor changing patterns of susceptibility and to be able to update treatment recommendations on a regular basis.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - High burden of antimicrobial resistance in Asia.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in Asian countries. In Asia, one of the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, MDR Salmonella enterica serotypes Choleraesuis and Typhi, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (OXA-58 and OXA-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant Candida glabrata. A few clones of MDR A. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in Asia, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed in China. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. Continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Evaluation of a commercial multiplex PCR test (SeptiFast) in the etiological diagnosis of community-onset bloodstream infections.
AB  - The commercial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, SeptiFast, is designed to identify the DNA of individual bacterial and fungal pathogens in whole blood. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of the test for the detection of community-onset bloodstream infections. We prospectively included adult patients who were subjected to blood culture (BC) at an infectious diseases department. For the evaluation, one BC/PCR set (two BC bottles and one PCR tube) per patient was used. When several sets were obtained and analyzed, the first set with any positive result was evaluated. Among 1,093 consecutively included patients, BC was positive in 138 and PCR was positive in 107. Fifty positive PCR results were supported by BC in the same BC/PCR set, ten were supported by other cultures, and, additionally, ten were supported by the clinical presentation. Compared with BC, PCR showed specificities and negative predictive values of >97% for all detectable pathogens. The following sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPVs) were noted: Staphylococcus aureus, 67% and 43%; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 12% and 67%; other Streptococcus species, 43% and 77%; Escherichia coli, 53% and 56%; and Klebsiella species, 43% and 23%. If support from other cultures and the clinical presentation were included in the reference standard, the PPVs for the detection of these bacteria were 57%, 100%, 92%, 75%, and 69%, respectively. Although the specificities were high, the low sensitivities and suboptimal PPVs noted in the present study discourage routine use of the test in its present form for the detection of community-onset bloodstream infections.
TI  - Microbiological profile of haematogenous osteoarticular infections in children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus, Kingella kingae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus are presently the most frequently identified bacteria in child haematogenous osteoarticular infection. OBJECTIVE: To determine the microbiological profile (bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility) of osteoarticular infections in a paediatric hospital, so as to adapt treatment protocols to the ecology of the bacteria isolated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective descriptive study, including children admitted for acute osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. A series of blood cultures was performed systematically on admission. In case of surgery, local samples were taken for bacteriology. Antibiotherapy was initiated and subsequently adapted to the bacteriological findings. RESULTS: One hundred and six children were included. Thirty-five were under (Group 1) and 71 over 3 years of age (Group 2). Ninety-five underwent surgery. Peroperative samples were positive in 61 cases and blood culture in 23. Bacteria were isolated in 22 patients in G1. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated in five neonates who had passed through intensive care. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated bacterium in G2 (n=40), and was methicillin-resistant (MRSA) in six children. DISCUSSION: Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism. Other than neonates who had passed through intensive care and the six patients with community-acquired MRSA infection, all isolated bacteria were susceptible to second-generation cephalosporins. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, prospective descriptive prognostic study.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological evaluation of hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP): should HDAP be included in healthcare-associated pneumonia?
AB  - Although hemodialysis-associated pneumonia (HDAP) was included among the healthcare-associated pneumonias (HCAP) in the 2005 American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline, little information relevant to clinical epidemiology, especially microbiological characteristics, is available. This study aimed to reveal microbiological characteristics and clinical outcomes of HDAP and to assess whether HDAP should be included in the HCAP category. We retrospectively analyzed 69 HDAP patients [42 with moderate and 27 with severe disease based on A-DROP (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation disturbance, and low blood pressure)] in whom sputum cultures were performed at our hospital between 2007 and 2009. The most common pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (37.7%), which were composed of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (27.5%) and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) (10.1%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.7%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.2%), and Moraxella catarrhalis (5.8%). This distribution mostly resembled the microbiological characteristics of HCAP reported previously, except that the frequency of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) gram negatives such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%) was clearly lower and that of MRSA was higher. There were no significant differences in microbiological findings, including the incidence of MDR pathogens, between the two severity groups. Despite most cases (82.6%) receiving only monotherapy, the prognosis (30-day survival and in-hospital mortality rates were 88.4% and, 17.4%, respectively) was similar to the past HCAP reports, but there were no significant correlations between prognosis and presence of MDR pathogens (30-day mortality rates 18.2% in MDR positive vs. 8.5% in MDR negative; p = 0.242). Assessment for not only MDR pathogens, but also severity of illness by the A-DROP system made it possible to conduct stratification based on prognosis. Our results suggest that HDAP should be included in the HCAP category, while understanding that there are some differences.
TI  - Confirmation of HIV-like sequences in respiratory tract bacteria of Cambodian and Kenyan HIV-positive pediatric patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria and yeasts isolated from respiratory tracts of 39 Cambodian  and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children were tested for the presence of HIV-1 sequences. MATERIAL/METHODS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract (nose, pharyngeal swabs) were isolated from 39 Cambodian and 28 Kenyan HIV-positive children. Bacterial chromosomal DNA was prepared by standard protocol and by Qiagen kit. The PCR specific for HIV sequences was carried out using HIV-1-specific primers.The analysis was performed by colony and dot-blot hybridization using HIV-1-specific primers which represent gag, pol and env genes of the virus. The sequencing of some PCR products was performed on the ABI 373 DNA Sequencer. RESULTS: The majority of microbes were characterized as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and resp. Candida albicans. In some cases E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis and Candida tropicalis were identified. Bacteria of 16 Cambodian (41%) and 8 Kenyan (31%) children were found to be positive in colony and dot-blot DNA hybridization. By the sequencing of PCR products synthesized on the template of patients' bacterial DNA using primers 68;69 for env HIV-1 gene, homology of greater than 90% with HIV-1 isolate HXB2 (HIVHXB2CG) was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria and yeasts from the respiratory tract of 41% of Cambodian and 31% of Kenyan HIV-positive children bear HIV-like sequences. The role of bacteria in the HIV disease process is discussed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against frequently encountered aerobic and facultative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole was evaluated against 15 011 clinical isolates obtained from patients in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. All Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ceftobiprole (MIC(90)'s for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of </= 1 mug/mL and 2 mug/mL, respectively). Ceftobiprole was active against penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC(90), </= 0.06 mug/mL), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90), </= 1 mug/mL). Over 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens isolates were inhibited by a ceftobiprole concentration of </= 1 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole was not active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and K. pneumoniae. The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole versus Pseudomonas aeruginosa was similar to that of cefepime (MIC(90), 16 mug/mL). The broad spectrum of activity by ceftobiprole would support further study of this agent in the treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistant pathogens from blood cultures from Canadian hospitals: results of the CANWARD 2007-2009 study.
AB  - This study assessed the epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections in Canadian hospitals between 2007 and 2009. Tertiary-care medical centers representing 8 of 10 Canadian provinces submitted bloodstream infection pathogens from patients attending hospital clinics, emergency rooms, medical/surgical wards, and intensive care units. Over 8,000 blood culture pathogens were collected. The 10 most common pathogens (representing 80.9% of all isolates) were Escherichia coli (1856 [22.6%]), Staphylococcus aureus (1457 [17.7%] including 1101 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 356 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), coagulase-negative staphylococci (907 [11.0%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (600 [7.3%]), Streptococcus pneumoniae (470 [5.7%]), Enterococcus faecalis (360 [4.4%]), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (333 [4.0%]), viridans group streptococci (321 [3.9%]), Enterobacter cloacae (193 [2.3%]), and Streptococcus pyogenes (159 [1.9%]). The most active agents against Gram-negative bacilli were carbapenems (e.g., meropenem and ertapenem) and piperacillin-tazobactam, while for Gram-positive cocci, they were vancomycin, linezolid, and daptomycin.
TI  - Multistep resistance development studies of ceftaroline in gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
AB  - Ceftaroline, the active component of the prodrug ceftaroline fosamil, is a novel  broad-spectrum cephalosporin with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive and -negative isolates. This study evaluated the potential for ceftaroline and comparator antibiotics to select for clones of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis with elevated MICs. S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes isolates in the present study were highly susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC range, 0.004 to 0.25 mug/ml). No streptococcal strains yielded ceftaroline clones with increased MICs (defined as an increase in MIC of >4-fold) after 50 daily passages. Ceftaroline MICs for H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were 0.06 to 2 mug/ml for four strains and 8 mug/ml for a beta-lactamase-positive, efflux-positive H. influenzae with a mutation in L22. One H. influenzae clone with an increased ceftaroline MIC (quinolone-resistant, beta-lactamase-positive) was recovered after 20 days. The ceftaroline MIC for this isolate increased 16-fold, from 0.06 to 1 mug/ml. MICs for S. aureus ranged from 0.25 to 1 mug/ml. No S. aureus isolates tested with ceftaroline had clones with increased MIC (>4-fold) after 50 passages. Two E. faecalis isolates tested had ceftaroline MICs increased from 1 to 8 mug/ml after 38 days and from 4 to 32 mug/ml after 41 days, respectively. The parental ceftaroline MIC for the one K. pneumoniae extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-negative isolate tested was 0.5 mug/ml and did not change after 50 daily passages.
TI  - Splenic abscess: a single institution study and review of the literature.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to review our experience with splenic abscesses, with respect to the relevant aspects of splenic abscesses and treatment outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 18 patients who had splenic abscesses and who were treated at our hospital from November 1993 to December 2008. RESULTS: The most common symptom at presentation was abdominal pain in 12 patients (66.7%). The median duration from symptom onset until establishment of a diagnosis was 22 days. Streptococcus viridans was the most common pathogen (27.8%), follow by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22.2%). The mortality rate during the inpatient period and the previous 90 days was 16.6%. Three of four patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a single abscess pocket. Four patients (22.2%) underwent percutaneous drainage, eight (44.5%) received antibiotic treatment only and six (33.3%) underwent splenectomy. CONCLUSION: There is no gold standard for treating splenic abscesses. Treatment should be customized for each patient.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. In Taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant Candida species. In addition, the emergence of XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. A few clones of XDR A. baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (ST 59) have disseminated in Taiwanese hospital settings. Besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in XDR P aeruginosa strains throughout Taiwan. An end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.
TI  - A multicentre surveillance study on the characteristics, bacterial aetiologies and in vitro antibiotic susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial resistance is a global problem and the prevalence is high in many Asian countries. METHODS: A prospective observational study of the prevalence of bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) was conducted in Indonesia, Philippines, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Hong Kong from August 2006 to April 2008. The diagnosis of AECB was based on increased cough and worsening of two of following: dyspnoea, increased sputum volume or purulence. Patients who had taken antibiotics within 72 h of presentation were excluded. All bacterial strains were submitted to a central laboratory for re-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to 16 antimicrobial agents according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: Four hundred and seven isolates were identified among 447 patients of AECB. The most frequent organisms isolated were Klebsiella pneumoniae and associated species (n = 91 + 17), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 71), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 63), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 32), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 22) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 21). According to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute susceptibility breakpoints, 85.7% and >90% of these pathogens were susceptible to levofloxacin and cefepime respectively. Other options with overall lower susceptibilities include imipenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin/clavulanate. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacteria including Klebsiella spp., P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. constitute a large proportion of pathogens identified in patients with AECB in some Asian countries. Surveillance on the local prevalence and antibiotic resistance of these organisms is important in guiding appropriate choice of antimicrobials in the management of AECB.
TI  - [Evaluation of target attainment rate of pazufloxacin mesilate using Monte Carlo  simulation method].
AB  - We calculated achievement rates of target attainment of AUC/MIC using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). Two doses of pazufloxacin mesilate (PZFX) between q.d. and b.i.d. were compared for each species of bacterium. Concentrations for AUC of PZFX of 8 patients were measured at this hospital, and those from a phase I clinical study (phase I, 6 healthy volunteers) were used. MICs of PZFX were determined for each species of bacterium of respiratory organ origin (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae). AUC per day of 500 mg b.i.d. used twice AUC (PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by patient, PZFX 500 mg x 2/day by phase I). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was AUC/MIC > or = 30 in S. pneumoniae and AUC/MIC > or = 125 in the other species of bacteria (P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae). As a result, patients showed an about 3 times higher AUC than the phase I subjects (67.9/21.9 microg/mL). In addition, the target attainment of AUC/MIC showed the highest rate in PZFX 500 mg x 2/day in patients with each type of bacteria: H. influenzae (98%), K. pneumoniae (89%), S. pneumoniae (66%), and P aeruginosa (41%). Target attainment of AUC/MIC was H. influenzae (91%), K. pneumoniae (81%), P. aeruginosa (5%), and S. pneumoniae (0%) in phase I. Therefore, the effectiveness of PZFX was estimated to be low using the MCS method with the phase I data.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis Media continues to be a major presentation in the ear, nose and throat clinic. AIM: This study aimed to isolate, characterize and identify the bacteriological and mycological etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ear discharge from 569 (299 males and 270 females) patients diagnosed clinically of otitis media between August 2009 and August 2010 were processed to recover the bacterial and fungal etiologic agents. Susceptibility test was performed on all bacterial isolate. RESULT: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.3%) was the predominant bacteria isolate causing otitis media followed by Staphylococcus aureus (21.0%), Klebsiella sp (8.9%), Proteus sp (8.2%), Alkaligenes spp (4.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9%), Escherichia coli (3.0%) and Citrobacter freundi (1.7%). Fungi isolated were Aspergillus niger (9.2%), Candida albicans (5.4%), Candida tropicalis (3.0%), Aspergillus flavus (2.1%) and Candida parasilopsis (1.5%). 413 had a single organism isolated from the middle ear culture while twenty (3.51%) patients had mixed organisms isolated. Infection was highest among 0 - 5 years, and lowest among aged 18 - 23. All bacterial isolates were poorly susceptible to the antibacterial agents. CONCLUSION: The study uncovers a high frequency of bacteria associated otitis media with the finding of fungi too as a significant etiologic agent.
TI  - Nationwide survey of antibacterial activity against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections in Japan (2008).
AB  - In this study, the causative bacteria and their sensitivity to various antimicrobial agents as well as risk factors for quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli were investigated in patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis or complicated cystitis by isolation and culture of bacteria from urine samples. In total, 1312 strains were isolated from 1009 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis, including E. coli (63.3%), Enterococcus faecalis (12.8%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (4.6%). In addition, 994 strains were isolated from 725 patients with complicated cystitis, including E. coli (36.4%), E. faecalis (19.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.0%), S. agalactiae (4.7%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%). At least 90% of E. coli isolates from acute uncomplicated cystitis showed sensitivity to fluoroquinolones and cephems, whilst 70.4-88.4% of E. coli isolates from complicated cystitis were sensitive to fluoroquinolones and 85.4-89.5% were sensitive to cephems. Factors associated with quinolone-resistant E. coli included two or more episodes of cystitis within 1 year, failure of quinolone therapy, underlying urinary tract disease, prior quinolone treatment within 1 month and age >/= 75 years. It is important to confirm the sensitivity of causative bacteria for optimal antimicrobial therapy, and empirical antimicrobial agents should be selected by considering patient characteristics and other factors.
TI  - [Bacterial flora in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) in Kunming, China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chinese recommendations for the management of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) include antibiotic treatments targeting the most frequently isolated pathogens according to the severity of COPD. The study objective was to check the relevance of these recommendations in Yunnan, a Southern Chinese province. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A descriptive and analytical survey was conducted in the Kunming Medical University hospital among patients over 60 years of age, hospitalized with AECOPD, between March 2007 and June 2008. RESULTS: The 74 included patients were predominantly male (90%), with a mean age of 78.6 years, active or ex-smokers (81%), mainly with moderate (43%) or severe COPD (34%). Out of 87 AECOPD episodes, 47 (54%) yielded significant quantitative sputum cultures for S. pneumoniae (10%), P. aeruginosa (10%), H. influenzae (7%), M. catarrhalis (7%), and K. pneumoniae (7%). The positivity of sputum cultures was significantly linked with a history of smoking (P=0.002). More than half of the P. aeruginosa isolates were multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of pathogens isolated from EABPCO in Kunming corroborates published results. It does not question Chinese recommendations for first-line antibiotic therapy, but the high prevalence of P. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae requires a periodic screening for acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Proposal of protocols using D-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  - Due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. One reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. XTT presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. However, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of D-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (TAC), as inducer of XTT reduction. The metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC(R)27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC(R)13883, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC(R)12228, Streptococcus mutans ATCC(R)25175, and Candida albicans SC5314 were evaluated. Results showed that D-glutamine 50 mM (for P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. epidermidis) and 25 mM (for S. mutans and C. albicans) may enhance the detection of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the XTT reduction assay more robust.

TI  - Phytochemical studies on Stemona aphylla: isolation of a new stemofoline alkaloid and six new stemofurans.
AB  - A new stemofoline alkaloid, (2'S)-hydroxy-(11S,12R)-dihydrostemofoline (3), new stemofurans M-R (8-13), and known compounds stemofoline (1), (2'S)-hydroxystemofoline (2), stemofuran E (4), stemofuran F (5), stemofuran J (6), and stilbostemin F (7) have been isolated from the root extracts of Stemona aphylla. The structures and relative configurations of these new compounds have been determined by spectroscopic data interpretation and from semisynthetic studies. These natural and semisynthetic alkaloids were tested for acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities and were found to be 10-20 times less active than 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline itself. Stemofurans 4, 6, 8, 11, and 13 were tested for their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Three of these showed antibacterial activities against MRSA with MIC values of 15.6 mug/mL.
TI  - Triggering receptor (TREM-1) expressed on myeloid cells predicts bacteremia better than clinical variables in community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Some clinical variables are associated with bacteremia  in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of this study was to analyse the accuracy of the soluble form of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1) to predict positive blood cultures in comparison with established clinical prognostic variables. METHODS: In addition to collecting clinical and laboratory information, a commercially available immunoassay kit was used to measure the serum sTREM-1 levels on the first day of admit ion in patients with CAP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the ability of sTREM-1 and commonly used clinical variables to identify bacteremia. RESULTS: Blood cultures yielded a pathogen in 13 (10.4%) out of 124 patient samples. The microorganisms isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (11 patients) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 patients). The presence of pleuritic chest pain, tachycardia and extreme white cell count (WCC) were associated with bacteremia. However, ROC curve analysis showed an accuracy of sTREM-1 (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.95), which was higher than pleuritic chest pain (AUC 0.71, 95% CI: 0.57-0.84), tachycardia (AUC 0.73, 95% CI: 0.58-0.88) and extreme WCC (AUC 0.70, 95% CI: 0.55-0.85) for predicting positive blood cultures. Low admission sTREM-1 serum values had a high negative predictive value for excluding bacteremia (sTREM-1 <120 pg/mL = 98.8%). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that the determination of sTREM-1 serum levels on admission may be more accurate than clinical variables for identifying bacteremic patients.
TI  - Investigation of oral opportunistic pathogens in independent living elderly Japanese.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pneumonia is reported to be associated with high morbidity in elderly  and compromised individuals, with poor oral health demonstrated to be a significant risk factor for pneumonia. Several opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, have been detected in patients with pneumonia. We investigated the prevalence of opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity of healthy independent living Japanese elderly subjects and analysed factors related to harbouring those pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 265 subjects, each of whom received a dental examination, during which specimens were collected with a tongue swab and examined for the presence of 10 oral opportunistic pathogens using single or multiple selective media. Furthermore, the presence of occult blood in saliva was examined using test paper strips. RESULTS: Oral opportunistic pathogens were detected in 13.6% of the subjects. Those positive for occult blood in saliva had a significantly higher rate of harbouring the pathogens (p < 0.05). In addition, age was a significant factor for the presence of pathogenic microbes in the oral cavity (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Positive findings of occult blood in saliva and older age are suggested to be significant factors for harbouring opportunistic pathogens in the oral cavity.
TI  - Susceptibility of community-acquired pathogens to antibiotics in Africa and Asia  in neonates--an alarmingly short review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility of community-acquired pathogens in neonatal sepsis to commonly prescribed antibiotics in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia since 2002. METHODS: Literature review in PubMed and Embase. Susceptibility was estimated for pathogens individually and stratified by region. Isolates were also classified into Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens to estimate their pooled susceptibility. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Only nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The available data indicated poor susceptibility to almost all commonly used antibiotics in pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella spp. Only Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited good susceptibility to all drugs other than cotrimoxazole. The extreme scarcity of data prevents drawing any firm conclusions beyond the urgent need for more studies to identify the best treatments for neonatal sepsis in the developing world.
TI  - [Etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in children. METHOD: A retrospective hospital infection study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from January 2005 to December 2008. RESULT: Six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as HAP. The incidence of HAP was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset HAP and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset HAP. The HAP patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). The proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. Main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. There was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in ICU, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. Two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. One hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. There were 30 (13.0%) Gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%) fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. The predominant bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations cephalosporins. The main pathogens of early-onset HAP were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset HAP were ESBLs-positive Klebsiella pneumonia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: HAP in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. The main pathogens are Gram-negative bacteria. RSV was an important pathogen of HAP. The pathogens of early-onset HAP are different from those of late-onset HAP. These results may be of some help in prevention and control of HAP in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.
TI  - Phytochemical investigations of Stemona curtisii and synthetic studies on stemocurtisine alkaloids.
AB  - The isolation of two new Stemona alkaloids, 1-hydroxyprotostemonine and stemocurtisine N-oxide, and a new benzofuran, stemofuran L, from the root extracts of Stemona curtisii is reported. The major known alkaloids from this plant extract, stemocurtisine, stemocurtisinol, and oxyprotostemonine, were also isolated along with oxystemokerrine N-oxide. The nonalkaloid components of this extract included a new benzofuran derivative, stemofuran L, the known stemofurans F, J, and K, dihydro-gamma-tocopherol, and stigmasterol. Stemocurtisine and stemocurtisinol were converted to their respective N-oxides by oxidation. Stemocurtisine was converted to a tetracyclic derivative by oxidative cleavage of the gamma-butyrolactone ring, while stemocurtisinol gave a novel lactam derivative by oxidative cleavage of the C-4 side chain under basic conditions. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities of some known and new alkaloids and their derivatives are also reported. All were 10-20 times less active as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the pyrrolo[1,2-a]azepine Stemona alkaloids stemofoline and 1',2'-didehydrostemofoline. None of the stemofuran compounds showed significant antibacterial or antifungal activities.
TI  - Evaluation of tigecycline activity in clinical isolates among Indian medical centers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistance to multiple antibiotics among Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and Gram negative bacilli (GNB) is high in India. Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a newer treatment option for emerging single or multidrug-resistant (MDR) GPC and GNB. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline and compared it against other antimicrobials. Between 2005-2007, seven Indian medical centers from diverse geographic regions forwarded 727 isolates [Escherichia coli (166), Staphylococcus aureus (125), Klebsiella spp (120), Streptococcus pneumoniae (102), Enterococcus spp. (100), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50), Acinetobacter spp. (50) and Enterobacter spp. (14)] from patients with blood stream (BSI), skin and soft tissue (SSTI) including surgical site, urinary tract and respiratory infections to our reference laboratory. Susceptibility to 11 antimicrobials besides tigecycline included: vancomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, quinopristin-dalfopristin, daptomycin, amikacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam was determined by agar dilution and Etest method. RESULT: Tigecycline was active against all GPC (MIC 90 < 0.25 mug/ml), E. coli and Klebsiella spp. (MIC 90 </=1 mug/ml). MDR Acinetobacter spp. showed lower susceptibility (70.6%) to tigecycline. Tigecycline MIC 90 values were not influenced by oxacillin resistance among S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, vancomycin resistance in Enterococci (VRE) and ESBL producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. Increased resistance was seen to other antimicrobials among ESBL producing E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Metallo Beta Lactamase (MBL) producing P. aeruginosa and VRE. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is an alternative option for emerging multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens exhibiting promising spectrum/potency exceeding currently available agents seen in India.
TI  - Antibacterial prenylated acylphloroglucinols from the fern Elaphoglossum yungense.
AB  - Seven new prenylated acylphloroglucinols, yungensins A-G, were isolated from the  diethyl ether extract of the scaly rhizomes and roots of an Argentine collection of the fern Elaphoglossum yungense. All the compounds contained a geranyl group attached to the filicinic acid-type residue. The diethyl ether extract and yungensins A-F displayed antibacterial effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 10 to 200 mug/mL. All tested acylphloroglucinols, except for yungensin D, caused bacteriolysis of S. aureus at MBC or higher doses (50-200 mug/mL). At 10 mug/mL, the ether extract as well as yungensins A, B, and D-F altered the biofilm production in both microoganisms.
TI  - [Susceptibility surveillance of clinical isolates to fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents from 2003 to 2008: post-marketing study of prulifloxacin].
AB  - Yearly changes in the susceptibility of clinical isolates to ulifloxacin (UFX) and other fluoroquinolones were examined through surveys over 3 periods. In the first survey, 534 strains derived from 19 species were collected from clinical specimens during 6 months from December 2003 to May 2004. In the same way, 805 strains were collected from December 2005 to May 2006 in the second survey, and 863 strains were from December 2007 to May 2008 in the third survey. Over these 3 study periods, the susceptibilities of fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were decreased. The isolation frequency of levofloxacin-nonsusceptible strain was increased from 0% to 11.8% and from 14.6% to 20.8%, respectively. MIC90s of UFX against these pathogens were also increased, but its MIC90 for E. coli was 2 to 4 times lower than that of levofloxacin. On the other hand, the susceptibility of strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae to UFX was increased. Among the fluoroquinolones tested, UFX showed the most potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and no changes in the MIC90s occurred during the surveillance. Although one strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in the third study period showed levofloxacin-resistance (MIC, 8 microg/mL), there were nearly no changes in the MIC90s of any agents tested including UFX against S. pneumoniae during the surveillance. As for other bacterial species, a tendency to increase in resistance to UFX was not observed. The activity of UFX against Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. was superior/equal to those of fluoroquinolones tested.
TI  - Bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae: clinical and microbiological characteristics in Taiwan, 2001-2008.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is the major cause of community-acquired pyogenic infections in Taiwan. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical and microbiological characteristics of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae in Taiwanese adults. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of bacteremic community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults due to K. pneumoniae were compared to those of adults with bacteremic CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan from 2001-2008. Risk factors for mortality of bacteremic CAP due to K. pneumoniae were analyzed. All clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae were examined for capsular serotypes, hypermucoviscosity phenotype, aerobactin and rmpA gene. RESULTS: K. pneumoniae was the dominant cause of bacteremic CAP and was associated with a more fulminant course and a worse prognosis than bacteremic CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Initial presentation with septic shock and respiratory failure were independent risk factors for both early and total mortality. Serotype K1 and K2 comprised around half of all isolates. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with bacteremic CAP due to K1/K2 and non-K1/K2 isolates. Hypermucoviscosity phenotype as well as the aerobactin and rmpA genes were highly prevalent in the K. pneumoniae isolates. CONCLUSIONS: K. pneumoniae continued to be the dominant cause of bacteremic CAP in Taiwanese adults during 2001-2008. Initial presentation with septic shock and respiratory failure were independent risk factors for both early and total mortality from K. pneumoniae bacteremic CAP. Serotypes K1/K2 comprised around half of all isolates, but did not predispose patients to a poor clinical outcome. Physicians should be aware of the poor prognosis of any patient with bacteremic K. pneumoniae CAP and monitor these patients more closely.
TI  - Microbes responsible for acute exacerbation of COPD.
AB  - This study was designed to find out the microbes responsible for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was carried out in the National Institute of Diseases of the Chest & Hospital (NIDCH), Dhaka during the period of January 2003 to December 2003. The study was a prospective case control study. There were 88 male and 2 female patients. The majority of the study subjects fell within the range of 50-70 years. All were smokers. 30 stable COPD patients were taken as control for comparison of sputum culture results of acute exacerbated COPD patients. A standard proforma with questionnaire was designed and filled to select patient with COPD. The patients were selected according to the predetermined criteria viz FEV1<70% predicted and FEV1/FVC % <70% of predicted. Morning specimen of sputum was collected after appropriate preparation and physical character of the sputum were noted. Sputum was immediately sent to microbiology lab for culture. Out of 30 stable COPD patients 6(20%) showed positive sputum culture for bacteria, Pseudomonas 3, Klebsiella 1, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 and Haemophilus influenza 1. Majority of them were Gram-negative organism. Out of 60 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD 39 patients (65%) showed positive culture for bacteria. Pseudomonas 15, Klebsiella 8, Acinetobacter 4, Enterobacter 2, Moraxella catarrhalis 2 and mixed organisms like, Pseudomonas + Klebsiella 2 and Pseudononas + Acinobacter 1. Majority were Gram-negative bacilli viz. Pseudomonas and Klebsiella spp. species. From this study it was concluded that the prevalence of lower airway bacterial colonization in outpatients with stable COPD is high and is mainly due to Gram-negative bacilli like Pseudomonas spp. The greater rate of isolation of pathogenic bacteria in exacerbated COPD than in stable COPD in this study, supports the pathogenic role of bacteria in a proportion of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The organism commonly play pathogenic role in acute exacerbations of COPD are Pseudomonas and Klebsiella. Acinobacter Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacter also contributed in exacerbation of COPD.
TI  - Solvent-free microwave extraction and hydrodistillation of essential oils from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran: comparison of antibacterial activity and contents.
AB  - The essential oils (EOs) obtained by solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME) and hydrodistillation (HD) from endemic Origanum husnucanbaseri H. Duman, Aytac & A. Duran were investigated using the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system. The main constituents of both oils obtained from SFME and HD from O. husnucanbaseri are borneol (15.2-12.8%), alpha-terpineol (12.3-10.8%) and trans-sabinene hydrate (11.8-9.92%). The EO obtained from SFME contained substantially higher amounts of oxygenated compounds and lower amounts of monoterpenes than that from HD. The antibacterial activities of the EOs from SFME and HD were evaluated by the disc diffusion method against six bacterial strains. The EO extracted by SFME was more effective than the EO extracted by HD against the tested bacteria, except for Klebsiella pneumoniae American type culture collection (ATCC) 13883. Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 19615 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in particular were more sensitive against the EO extracted by SFME.
TI  - Non-antibiotics reverse resistance of bacteria to antibiotics.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most clinical isolates that exhibit a multi-drug resistant phenotype  owe that resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps. Compounds that are efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) reduce or reverse resistance to antibiotics to which the bacterial strain is initially resistant. We have evaluated non-antibiotics to reduce resistance of commonly encountered bacterial pathogens to antibiotics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of non-antibiotics on the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics was conducted by minimum inhibition concentration determinations of the antibiotic in the absence and presence of the non-antibiotic. RESULTS: Non-antibiotics such as chlorpromazine, amitryptiline and trans-chlorprothixene are shown to reduce or reverse resistance of a variety of bacteria to antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that non-antibiotics may serve as adjuncts to conventional antibiotics for the therapy of problematic antibiotic infections caused by bacteria that owe their resistance to over-expressed efflux pumps.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents --special references to bacteria isolated between April 2008 and March 2009].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2008 to March 2009 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 712 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 173 (80.5%) of 215 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and sixty-six strains were isolated from primary infections, and 346 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, E. lenta was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus and Bilophila wadsworthia, and from postoperative infections, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by B. thetaiotaomicron, B. wadsworthia and B. ovatus, in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and Enterococcus spp., nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Etiology and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of community- and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections in a general hospital in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the bacterial profile and prevalence of antibiotic resistance patterns of uropathogens, as well as evaluate the problem with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing isolates, causing urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Al-Amiri Hospital, Kuwait, over a 3-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Isolates (56,505) from symptomatic UTI cases from January 2005 to December 2007 were identified by conventional methods and the VITEK identification card system. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method for Gram-positive organisms and an automated VITEK 2 machine for Gram-negative organisms. ESBL production by the Enterobacteriaceae was detected by the double-disk diffusion method and VITEK-2 system. RESULTS: Significant bacteriuria was detected in 15,064 (26.6%) of the 56,505 urine samples. Escherichia coli accounted for 4,876 (54.9%) from community-acquired UTI (CA-UTI) and 2,253 (36.4%) from hospital-acquired UTI (HA-UTI), followed by Streptococcus agalactiae (1,129, 12.7%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (962, 10.8%) from CA-UTI cases. Candida spp. (973, 15.7%) and K. pneumoniae (747, 12.1%) were the second and third most prevalent isolates, respectively, in HA-UTI. High resistance rates were observed among the Enterobacteriaceae against ampicillin, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. About 855 (12%) and 291 (17%) of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively, were resistant to >/=4 antibiotics. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae in CA-UTI was 12 and 17% and in HA-UTI 26 and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A high percentage of the uropathogens causing UTI in the Al-Amiri Hospital setting was highly resistant to the first- and second-line antibiotics for the therapy of UTI. ESBL-producing bacteria are highly prevalent in our hospital.
TI  - Light insensitive silver(I) cyanoximates as antimicrobial agents for indwelling medical devices.
AB  - Ten silver(I) cyanoximates of AgL composition (L = NC-C(NO)-R, where R is electron withdrawing groups: -CN, -C(O)NR(2), -C(O)R' (alkyl), -C(O)OEt, 2-heteroaryl fragments such as 2-pyridyl, 2-benzimidazolyl, 2-benzoxazolyl, 2-benzthiazolyl) were synthesized and characterized using spectroscopic methods and X-ray analysis. Crystal structures of four complexes were determined and revealed the formation of two-dimensional (2D) coordination polymers of different complexity in which anions exhibit bridging or combined chelate and bridging binding modes. In these compounds, anions are in the nitroso form. All studied AgL complexes are sparingly soluble in water and are thermally stable to 150 degrees C. Synthesized compounds demonstrated remarkable insensitivity toward visible light and UV-radiation, which was explained based on their polymeric structures with multiple covalent bonds between bridging cyanoxime ligands and Ag(I) centers. All 10 silver(I) cyanoximates were tested in vitro on the subject of their antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus hirae, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium fortuitum as well as against Candida albicans in solutions, and in the solid state as pressed pellets and dried filter paper disks presoaked with solutions of AgL in DMF. Results showed pronounced antimicrobial activity for all investigated complexes. A combination of five factors: (1) light insensitivity, (2) poor water solubility, (3) high thermal stability, (4) lack of toxicity of organic ligands, and (5) in vitro antimicrobial activity allows development of silver(I) cyanoximates for medical applications. These include antimicrobial additives to acrylate glue, cured by UV-radiation, used in introduction of prosthetic joints and dental implants, and prevention of biofilm formation on several types of indwelling medical devices.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of nemonoxacin, a novel non-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vivo antibacterial efficacy of nemonoxacin, a novel C8-methoxy non-fluorinated quinolone in murine systemic and local infection models. METHODS: The efficacy of nemonoxacin in systemic infections was evaluated in mouse peritonitis models using isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, n=1), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n=1), methicillin- and levofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus capitis (levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, n=1), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP, n=1), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, n=2), Enterococcus faecalis (n=2, including 1 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, VRE) and Escherichia coli (n=3). The local infections included mouse pulmonary infections caused by PRSP (n=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1) and mouse ascending urinary tract infection caused by E. coli (n=1). RESULTS: In the mouse systemic infection model, nemonoxacin demonstrated potent activity against MSSA (ED(50) =2.08 mg/kg), MRSA (ED(50) =2.59 mg/kg), levofloxacin-resistant MRSC (ED(50) =2.52 mg/kg), PISP (ED(50) =5.47 mg/kg), PRSP (ED(50) =3.68-5.28 mg/kg) and E. coli (ED(50) =3.13-5.28 mg/kg), and moderate activity towards E. faecalis infection (ED(50) =8.48-15.16 mg/kg). The therapeutic efficacy of nemonoxacin was significantly higher (P<0.01) than that of levofloxacin in infections caused by Gram-positive isolates (MSSA, MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PISP, PRSP and E. faecalis), but less potent than that of levofloxacin against E. coli infection (P<0.01). Nemonoxacin in vivo efficacy results with Gram-positive isolates (2- to 5-fold ED(50) advantage over levofloxacin) are consistent with the MIC data (4- to 16-fold MIC advantage of nemonoxacin over levofloxacin). In the mouse pulmonary infection model, nemonoxacin showed potent activity towards PRSP (higher than levofloxacin) and K. pneumoniae (lower than levofloxacin) infections. In the mouse ascending urinary tract infection model, nemonoxacin exhibited potent activity against E. coli infection (lower than levofloxacin). CONCLUSIONS: The results validated the potent efficacy of nemonoxacin in vivo. The higher efficacy of nemonoxacin than of levofloxacin towards infections caused by Gram-positive cocci (especially MRSA, levofloxacin-resistant MRSC, PRSP and VRE) warrants investigation of its clinical use.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study is to assess the antibacterial activity of sodium citrate against Streptococcus pneumoniae and several oral bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity was determined by broth microdilution method. The results showed that although Enterocuccus faecium OB7084 and Klebsiella pneumoniae OB7088 had high tolerance to sodium citrate, several oral bacteria including Fusobacterium nucleatum JCM8532(T) , Streptococcus mutans JCM5705(T) and Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) were susceptible. Furthermore, the bactericidal activity of sodium citrate against Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was not influenced by pH in the range of 5.0-8.0, whereas that of sodium lactate was weakened at neutral or weak alkaline pH. When Strep. pneumoniae NBRC102642(T) was treated with sodium citrate for 2 h, many burst cells were observed. However, addition of MgCl(2) or CaCl(2) to an assay medium weakened the antimicrobial activity although ZnCl(2) or MnCl(2) did not influence. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of pH, sodium citrate inhibited the growth of oral bacteria, which suggests that the mechanism is different from that of sodium lactate. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented in this study would be available for understanding the antimicrobial property of sodium citrate.
TI  - [Acquired bacterial meningitis in Monastir region, Tunisia (1999-2006): bacteriological aspects and susceptibility patterns].
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of bacteria responsible for purulent meningitis and the pattern of resistance of common species in the University Hospital of Monastir (Tunisia). All bacteriologically confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis were recorded between 1999 and 2006, and have been analyzed by classic bacterial methods advocate for meningitis. Two hundred fifty three strains have been isolated. The most frequent species were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitides with 19.4, 13.8, 13.8, 7.1, and 6.3% of cases, respectively. Their distribution with regard to age was in accordance with literature data. The yearly distribution of these bacteria did not show any epidemic peak. Enterobacteriaceae and group B Streptococcus were the most frequently identified pathogens in neonatal meningitis. H. Influenzae was the predominant microorganism in children between three month and five years of age (36.3%), followed by S. Pneumoniae (28.8%). S. Pneumoniae was the predominant bacteria responsible for 47% of the cases over five years of age. 38.8% of S. Pneumoniae strains were less susceptible to penicillin. Resistance rates for amoxicillin and cefotaxime were 4.1%, respectively. Only one strain of N. meningitidis (6.2%) presented a decreased susceptibility to penicillin. 22.9% of H. Influenzae strains produced beta-lactamase. The resistance rates of Enterobacteriaceae to third generation cephalosporins were 25%. In our study, nosocomial meningitis have shown a rate of 24.4%. The most affected service was neurosurgery, pediatrics, and intensive care units. The increasing prevalence of pneumococci meningitis with reduced sensitivity to penicillin G strains isolated from meningitis makes adequate therapeutic management difficult.
TI  - Are elderly end-stage renal disease patients more susceptible for drug resistant  organisms in their sputum?
AB  - End stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are at risk for pneumonia in view of their impaired immune status. Similar empiric antibiotic regimens are used in elderly as well as young ESRD patients with respiratory tract infections. We conducted an observational, cross sectional study between June 2007 and June 2008 in 100 ESRD patients half being > 65 yrs. All patients had positive sputum culture and chest X-ray findings of pneumonia Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest in younger while Klebsiella pneumoniae in > 65 yrs old patients. Elderly patients had significant resistance to common antibiotics. Ceftrioxone was the most suitable antibiotic in the younger patients while a combination of piperacillin with gentamycin was the best choice in the geriatric age group. In conclusion, organisms cultured from sputum in ESRD patients with pneumonia were different in the ESRD patients of more than and less than 65 years of age as well as the drug susceptibility. We should probably redefine the management of pneumonia according to the sensitivities in our local populations to better treat these patients.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in Canadian hospitals: results of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008).
AB  - A total of 5,282 bacterial isolates obtained between 1 January and 31 December 31 2008, inclusive, from patients in 10 hospitals across Canada as part of the Canadian Ward Surveillance Study (CANWARD 2008) underwent susceptibility testing. The 10 most common organisms, representing 78.8% of all clinical specimens, were as follows: Escherichia coli (21.4%), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; 13.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.4%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; 5.1%), Haemophilus influenzae (4.1%), Enterococcus spp. (3.3%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.2%). MRSA comprised 27.0% (272/1,007) of all S. aureus isolates (genotypically, 68.8% of MRSA were health care associated [HA-MRSA] and 27.6% were community associated [CA-MRSA]). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of E. coli isolates. The CTX-M type was the predominant ESBL, with CTX-M-15 the most prevalent genotype. MRSA demonstrated no resistance to ceftobiprole, daptomycin, linezolid, telavancin, tigecycline, or vancomycin (0.4% intermediate intermediate resistance). E. coli demonstrated no resistance to ertapenem, meropenem, or tigecycline. Resistance rates with P. aeruginosa were as follows: colistin (polymyxin E), 0.8%; amikacin, 3.5%; cefepime, 7.2%; gentamicin, 12.3%; fluoroquinolones, 19.0 to 24.1%; meropenem, 5.6%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 8.0%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (5.9%) but uncommonly in E. coli (1.2%) and K. pneumoniae (0.9%). In conclusion, E. coli, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), P. aeruginosa, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and Enterococcus spp. are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian hospitals. The prevalence of MRSA was 27.0% (of which genotypically 27.6% were CA-MRSA), while ESBL-producing E. coli occurred in 4.9% of isolates. An MDR phenotype was common in P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Role of periodontitis in hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - This study evaluated the role of periodontal pathogens in 50 hospitalized patients with hospital acquired pneumonia compared with 30 healthy controls. Specimens of oropharyngeal aspirate, dental plaque bronchoalveolar lavage and blood cultured 1 or more pathogens in around 80% of patients, predominatel Staphylococcus aureus, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiell pneumoniae. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns showed concordance of bacterial cultures from dental plaque an oropharyngeal cavity in 13 patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in patients than ii controls and there was a significant correlation between serum and salivary CR1' levels. Dental plaque bioflln may promote oral and oronpharyngeal colonization of respiratory pathogens in hospitalized subiects.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease: the MONALISA study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of moxifloxacin versus levofloxacin plus metronidazole in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) in Asia. DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. SETTING: Multicentre, multinational study in the inpatient and/or outpatient setting. POPULATION: Women (aged >/=18 years) with uPID (defined as PID with no pelvic or tubo-ovarian abscess on pelvic ultrasonography and at laparoscopic examination) and not requiring intravenous treatment. METHODS: Women received a 14-day course of either oral moxifloxacin, 400 mg once daily, or oral levofloxacin, 500 mg once daily, plus oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily. Additionally, a single dose of ceftriaxone, 250 mg intramuscularly, was administered to women who had a positive screening test for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary measure of efficacy was clinical response at test-of-cure (TOC) (7-14 days after the last dose of study drug) in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of moxifloxacin to the comparator regimen was demonstrated if lower limit of 95% CI was >-15%. Other measures were clinical response during therapy and at 4-week follow up, microbiological response at TOC, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 460 women were randomised to the study. For the primary measure of efficacy (clinical cure at TOC), moxifloxacin was noninferior to levofloxacin plus metronidazole (moxifloxacin: 152/194, 78.4%; comparator 155/190, 81.6%; 95% CI -10.7 to +4.9). The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline included Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Bacteriological success rates were high and comparable between treatment arms (microbiologically valid populations, moxifloxacin 27/30, 90.0%; comparator 22/26, 84.6%; 95% CI -12.7 to +20.3). Both treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin monotherapy, 400 mg once daily for 14 days, is an effective and well-tolerated oral treatment for women with uPID.
TI  - Serum tumor necrosis factor alpha and C-reactive protein in pediatric patients with sepsis and its correlation with microbiologic findings.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and C--reactive protein (CRP) with microbiologically documented cases of sepsis versus clinically documented cases of sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy nine pediatric patients with sepsis were studied. Relevant specimens were processed for bacterial or fungal etiology. TNF-a was detected by enzyme immunoassay and CRP was detected by latex agglutination. Thirty healthy cases were included in the study to establish baseline TNF-alpha levels. RESULTS: Forty two (53.2%) patients had a microbiologically documented sepsis. Among Gram negative bacilli Escherichia coli was the most common isolate followed by Klebsiella spp. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominated among the Gram positive cocci. Patients with a positive culture had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than patients with a negative culture (70 pg/ml vs. 33 pg/ml P < 0.01). Further, pure gram negative infection correlated with significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than pure (P < 0.01) gram positive infection. The CRP values did not highlight these differences significantly. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha level was significantly raised in patients with sepsis. TNF-a levels were raised significantly in culture positive cases in general and in Gram negative infections in particular. Serum TNF-alpha was a more sensitive marker for different categories of sepsis compared to CRP and microbiology culture.
TI  - Overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  - The rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. This reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome situation. Major problems are encountered for a growing number of Gram-positive (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative pathogens (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae). We provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and healthcare settings. In addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. It is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.
TI  - A report from the 20th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious  Diseases (April 10-13, 2010 - Vienna, Austria).
AB  - Effective antimicrobials currently in use in Europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. Multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID). As extensively discussed in an oral session entitled Worldwide Dissemination of Resistances by 10 specialists from across Europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (Roede, B.M. et al., Abst O127; Huenger, F. et al., Abst O395; Mera, R.M. et al., Abst O483). While many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (Derde, L. et al., Abst O464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the Austria Center in Vienna. The war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. Treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. However, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in Vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of novel fluoroquinolone derivatives containing substituted piperidines.
AB  - We report herein the synthesis of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-aminomethyl-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl) fluoroquinolone derivatives. The antibacterial activity of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated and correlated with their physicochemical properties. Results reveal that all of the target compounds have good potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis including MRSE (MIC: 0.125-4 microg/mL). Compounds 12, 13 are more potent than or comparable to levofloxacin against MRSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella sonnei. Compound 17 is more active than or comparable to levofloxacin against S. aureus including MRSA, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes.
TI  - Evaluation of the antibacterial activity of the methylene chloride extract of Miconia ligustroides, isolated triterpene acids, and ursolic acid derivatives.
AB  - The methylene chloride extract of Miconia ligustroides (DC.) Naudin (Melastomataceae), the isolated compounds ursolic and oleanolic acids and a mixture of these acids, and ursolic acid derivatives were evaluated against the following microorganisms: Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), Vibrio cholerae (ATCC 9458), Salmonella choleraesuis (ATCC 10708), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 10031), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305). The microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. The methylene chloride extract showed no activity against the selected microorganisms. Ursolic acid was active against B. cereus, showing a MIC value of 20 microg/mL. Oleanolic acid was effective against B. cereus and S. pneumoniae with a MIC of 80 microg/mL in both cases. The mixture of triterpenes, ursolic and oleanolic acids, did not enhance the antimicrobial activity. However, the acetyl and methyl ester derivatives, prepared from ursolic acid, increased the inhibitory activity for S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical profile of Community acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The aim of our study was to obtain comprehensive insight into the bacteriological and clinical profile of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. The patient population consisted of 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), as defined by British Thoracic society, from December 1998 to Dec 2000, at the Sher- i-Kashmir institute of Medical Sciences Soura, Srinagar, India. Gram negative organisms were the commonest cause (19/29), followed by gram positive (10/29). In 71 cases no etiological cause was obtained. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the commonest pathogen (10/29), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (7/29), Escherichia coli (6/29), Klebsiella spp. (3/29), Streptococcus pyogenes (1/29), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1/29) and Acinetobacter spp. (1/29). Sputum was the most common etiological source of organism isolation (26) followed by blood (6), pleural fluid (3), and pus culture (1). Maximum number of patients presented with cough (99%), fever (95%), tachycardia (92%), pleuritic chest pain (75%), sputum production (65%) and leucocytosis (43%). The commonest predisposing factors were smoking (65%), COPD (57%), structural lung disease (21%), diabetes mellitus (13%), and decreased level of consciousness following seizure (eight per cent) and chronic alcoholism (one per cent). Fourteen patients, of whom, nine were males and five females, died. Staphylococcus aureus was the causative organism in four, Pseudomonas in two, Klebsiella in one, and no organism was isolated in seven cases. The factors predicting mortality at admission were - age over 62 years, history of COPD or smoking, hypotension, altered sensorium, respiratory failure, leucocytosis, and staphylococcus pneumonia and undetermined etiology. The overall rate of identification of microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia was 29%, which is very low, and if serological tests for legionella, mycoplasma and viruses are performed the diagnostic yield would definitely be better. This emphasizes the need for further studies (including the serological tests for Legionella, mycoplasma and viruses) to identify the microbial etiology of CAP.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of tualang honey and its effect in burn wound management: a comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of honey as a natural product of Apis spp. for burn treatment has been widely applied for centuries. Tualang honey has been reported to have antibacterial properties against various microorganisms, including those from burn-related diagnoses, and is cheaper and easier to be absorbed by Aquacel dressing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential antibacterial properties of tualang honey dressing and to determine its effectiveness as a partial thickness burn wound dressing. METHODS: In order to quantitate the bioburden of the swabs, pour plates were performed to obtain the colony count (CFU/ml). Swabs obtained from burn wounds were streaked on blood agar and MacConkey agar for bacterial isolation and identification. Later, antibacterial activity of Aquacel-tualang honey, Aquacel-Manuka honey, Aquacel-Ag and Aquacel- plain dressings against bacteria isolated from patients were tested (in-vitro) to see the effectiveness of those dressings by zone of inhibition assays. RESULTS: Seven organisms were isolated. Four types of Gram-negative bacteria, namely Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., and three Gram-positive bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus aureus (CONS) and Streptococcus spp., were isolated. Total bacterial count decreased on day 6 and onwards. In the in-vitro antibacterial study, Aquacel-Ag and Aquacel-Manuka honey dressings gave better zone of inhibition for Gram positive bacteria compared to Aquacel-Tualang honey dressing. However, comparable results were obtained against Gram negative bacteria tested with Aquacel-Manuka honey and Aquacel-Tualang honey dressing. CONCLUSIONS: Tualang honey has a bactericidal as well as bacteriostatic effect. It is useful as a dressing, as it is easier to apply and is less sticky compared to Manuka honey. However, for Gram positive bacteria, tualang honey is not as effective as usual care products such as silver-based dressing or medical grade honey dressing.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy: focus on cefditoren.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy to commonly used antibiotics including cefditoren. Six clinical microbiological laboratories collected, between January and September 2009, a total of 2,510 respiratory pathogens from subjects with community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI). Ceftditoren, out of all the beta-lactams studied, had the lowest MIC(90 )against 965 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae examined, followed by cefotaxime and ceftriaxone (2% resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP)). Against 470 Haemophilus influenzae , independently of their production of beta-lactamases or ampicillin resistance, cefditoren was the oral cephalosporin with the best in vitro activity, comparable to that of the injectable cephalosporins and levofloxacin. Higher MIC(90)s were found for the macrolides (4 - 16 mg/l) and cefaclor (4 - 32 mg/l). As was foreseeable, Streptococcus pyogenes (225 strains) was uniformly sensitive to all the beta-lactam antibiotics, but the elevated MIC(90 )values reduced (<75%) susceptibility of this pathogen to macrolides. Beta-lactamase-negative Moraxella catarrhalis (100 strains) had reduced susceptibility only to the macrolides, while the 250 beta-lactamase-producing strains also had reduced susceptibility to cefuroxime. Levofloxacin showed the lowest MIC(50)/MIC(90 )values in the producing strains, whereas cefditoren, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in the non-producers. As regards the enterobacteriaceae, cefditoren and levofloxacin had the lowest MIC(90)s against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cefditoren and the third-generation injectable cephalosporins had the lowest MIC(90)s against Escherichia coli (100% susceptibility) while levofloxacin was less active (86% susceptibility).In conclusion, cefditoren's wide spectrum and high intrinsic activity, as well as its capacity to overcome most of the resistance that has become consolidated in some classes of antibiotics widely used as empiric therapy for CARTI, allows us to suggest that cefditoren might be included in the european guidelines as one of the first-choice antibiotics in the treatment of CARTI.
TI  - [The role of microflora in etiology of chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Analysis of the results of a bacteriological study involving 218 patients with various forms of chronic tonsillitis (CT) has demonstrated that they were significantly different in terms of the seeding rate of beta-hemolytic group A Streptococci (BHAS). Specifically, these microorganisms were detected in patients with paratonsillar abscess 2.5 times as frequently as in those with uncomplicated forms of chronic tonsilitis. In other words, the former group is at risk of developing such concomitant diseases as post-streptococcal rheumocarditis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis. It was shown that BHAS are capable of forming a biological film at the surface of abiogenic carriers in vitro which may be a principal cause of chronic and recurring tonsillitis.
TI  - [Immunization and bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx as risk factors for alopecia areata].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alopecia areata is an autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the hair follicles. Researchers are currently interested in whether the presence of bacterial pathogens and/or a history of immunization can trigger an autoimmune response in patients who are genetically predisposed. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between the development of alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or a history of immunization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-five men and women with alopecia areata and 65 control patients with other skin diseases were studied at the Dr Ladislao de la Pascua Dermatology Clinic between September 2008 and February 2009. The patients ranged in age from 18-59 years. Patients with scalp diseases were excluded from the control group. In all cases, the patient was questioned about immunizations received in the previous 6 months, and a throat swab was cultured. RESULTS: A history of immunization (odds ratio [OR], 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-6.7; P=.001), the presence of bacterial pathogens in the oropharynx (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.2; P=.033), and being a carrier of Streptococcus pyogenes (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.7-2.5; P=.042) were risk factors for alopecia areata. Klebsiella pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli were isolated from cultures. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show an association between alopecia areata and throat carriage of bacterial pathogens or history of immunization, as risk factors for development of the disease. Given the characteristics of our study population, the association appears valid for patients with less than 25% hair loss and a course of disease under 1 year.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia following cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer: clinical features, treatment outcome and prognostic factors.
AB  - Data regarding treatment outcomes and prognosis in pneumonia that occurs after lung cancer chemotherapy are lacking. We performed a retrospective study of 84 patients with clinically suspected bacterial pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer. Small cell carcinoma was the most common histological type (36.9%, n = 31), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (35.7%, n = 30) and adenocarcinoma (21.4%, n = 18). The most frequent pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 14), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 7). Of 84 patients, treatment outcome was determined for 80; the outcome was success in 52 (61.9%) and failure in 28 (33.3%); outcome remained undetermined for 4 patients (4.8%). Based on multivariate analysis, tachypnoea (respiratory rate >/=20/min) was the only significant predictor of treatment failure (odds ratio 4.79, 95% confidence interval 1.17-19.70; p = 0.030). In conclusion, bacterial pneumonia after cytotoxic chemotherapy for lung cancer was found to be caused more often by S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae than P. aeruginosa, and treatment failure leading to death was found to be high. Tachypnoea was independently associated with treatment failure in this population.
TI  - Microbiological profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In bacterial conjunctivitis, clinical presentations are not diagnostic of the causative agent, therefore, microbiological analysis is mandatory for specific treatment option. This study was undertaken to determine the microbiology profile of bacterial conjunctivitis in our environment. METHODOLOGY: This is a laboratory-based study carried out in the Medical Microbiology Laboratory of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Conjunctival swabs collected from 365 patients with clinically diagnosed conjunctivitis, were analysed by standard bacteriological methods. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 342 (93.7%) conjunctival samples while 23(6.3%) were sterile. Of the pathogens, 256 (74.9%) were Staphylococcus aureus, 35(10.2%) Coagulase- negative staphylococci, 22 (6.4%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa , 11(3.2%) Escherichia coli, 7(2.1%) Klebsiella species, 5(1.5%) Streptococcus pneumoniae , 4(1.2%) Haemophilus influenzae, 1(0.3%) Proteus mirabilis, and 1(0.3%)Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The highest rate of conjunctivitis 96(26.3%) was found among infants and children (0-10years).Resistance rates to most of the tested antibiotics were high. However, 67% of them were susceptible to ceftriaxone while only 39.2% were susceptible to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSION: This study has recorded high antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens of conjunctivitis in this environment; therefore, determining the susceptibility pattern of these pathogens to available antibiotics is crucial to effective management of bacterial conjunctivitis.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern of causative organisms of neonatal septicemia in an urban hospital of Bangladesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The information of the sensitivity pattern of the causative organisms is very important for effective control of septicemia in neonates. OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion and profile of pathogenic bacteria in the blood cultures of the neonates with clinically suspected septicemia and their susceptibility pattern to antimicrobial agents for developing a unified antibiotic treatment protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted over a period of 3 year and 4 months (39 months). The study included 1000 patients admitted in the selected hospital in Bangladesh. Blood samples for culture were taken aseptically before starting antibiotic therapy. Microorganisms were isolated and identified by standard microbiological processes which include colony morphology, Gram stain, and biochemical profiles. Antimicrobial sensitivity patterns were performed by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method against imipenem, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, chloramphenicol, netilmicin, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, cefotaxime, cephalexin, and ampicillin. RESULTS: Among the patients, 633 (63.3%) were males and 367 (36.7%) were females. Blood cultures were found positive in 194 (19.4%) neonates. The organisms isolated were Pseudomonas spp. (31.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Acinatobactor (5.7%), Gram-negative Bacilli (4.1%), Flavobacterium spp. (3.6%), Serratia spp. (5.7%), Citrobacter fruendi (3.1%), Streptococcus species (2.6%), and Enterobacter spp. (1.0%). A majority of the bacterial isolates in neonatal sepsis were found sensitive to imipenem (91.8%) and ciprofloxacin (57.2%) and resistant to commonly used antibiotics, eg. ampicillin (96.4%) and cephalexin (89.2%). CONCLUSION: The problem can be mitigated by careful selection and prudent use of available antibiotics.
TI  - Pyogenic liver abscess: differences in etiology and treatment in Southeast Asia and Central Europe.
AB  - Knowledge of etiology and timely treatment of underlying causes, when possible, play an important role in the successful therapy of patients with pyogenic liver abscess (PLA). Recent publications from Central Europe and Southeast Asia hint at considerable differences in etiology. In this article, we aim to elaborate these differences and their therapeutic implications. Apart from some special types of PLA that are comparable in Southeast Asia and Central Europe (such as posttraumatic or postprocedural PLA), there are clear differences in the microbiological spectrum, which implies different risk factors and disease courses. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) PLA is predominantly seen in Southeast Asia, whereas, in Central Europe, PLA is typically caused by Escherichia coli, Streptococcus or Staphylococcus, and these patients are more likely to be older and to have a biliary abnormality or malignancy. K. pneumoniae patients are more likely to have diabetes mellitus. Control of septic spread is crucial in K. pneumoniae patients, whereas treatment of the underlying diseases is decisive in many Central European PLA patients.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital in India: role of multi-drug resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequent intensive-care-unit (ICU)-acquired infection. The aetiology of VAP varies with different patient populations and types of ICUs. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study was performed over a period of 15 months in a tertiary care hospital to determine the various aetiological agents causing VAP and the prevalence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. Combination disk method, Modified Hodge test, EDTA disk synergy (EDS) test and AmpC disk test were performed for the detection of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), carbapenemases, metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and AmpC beta-lactamases respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida spp. were more common in early-onset VAP, while non-fermenters (Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp.) were significantly associated with late-onset VAP (P value 0.0267, Chi-square value 4.91). Thirty-seven (78.7%) of the 47 VAP pathogens were multidrug resistant. ESBL was produced by 50% and 67% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. MBL was produced by 20% of P. aeruginosa. AmpC beta-lactamases were produced by 33.3% and 60.7% of the Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters respectively. Of the S. aureus isolates, 43% were methicillin resistant. Prior antibiotic therapy and hospitalization of five days or more were independent risk factors for VAP by MDR pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: VAP is increasingly associated with MDR pathogens. Production of ESBL, AmpC beta-lactamases and metallo beta-lactamases were responsible for the multi-drug resistance of these pathogens. Increasing prevalence of MDR pathogens in patients with late-onset VAP indicate that appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used to treat them.
TI  - Changing etiology of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: a nationwide multicenter study in Korea.
AB  - Epidemiologic data on the etiologic organisms is important for appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningitis. We identified the etiologies of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in Korean adults and the associated epidemiological factors. A retrospective, multicenter nationwide study was carried out. Patients 18 years of age or older with community-acquired bacterial meningitis with a confirmed pathogen were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, and microbiological data were collected. One hundred and ninety-five cases were collected. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (50.8%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.7%), Listeria monocytogenes (6.7%), and group B Streptococcus (3.1%). The penicillin resistance rate of the S. pneumoniae was 60.3%; 40.0% of the organisms were not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. The combination of third-generation cephalosporin with vancomycin was used in 76.3% of cases. Steroids were given before or with the first dose of antibiotics in 37.4% of patients. The 30-day mortality rate was 20.5% and neurological sequelae developed in 15.6% of cases. S. pneumoniae was the most common organism identified in community-acquired bacterial meningitis among Korean adults. S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, and group B Streptococcus were also common. S. pneumoniae had high rates of resistance to penicillin and third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Invasive bacterial infections in neonates and young infants born outside hospital admitted to a rural hospital in Kenya.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial sepsis is thought to be a major cause of young infant deaths in low-income countries, but there are few precise estimates of its burden or causes. We studied invasive bacterial infections (IBIs) in young infants, born at home or in first-level health units ("outborn") who were admitted to a Kenyan rural district hospital during an 8-year period. METHODS: Clinical and microbiologic data, from admission blood cultures and cerebrospinal fluid cultures on all outborn infants aged less than 60 days admitted from 2001 to 2009, were examined to determine etiology of IBI and antimicrobial susceptibilities. RESULTS: Of the 4467 outborn young infants admitted, 748 (17%) died. Five hundred five (11%) had IBI (10% bacteremia and 3% bacterial meningitis), with a case fatality of 33%. The commonest organisms were Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Group B Streptococcus, Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Group A Streptococcus. Notably, some blood culture isolates were seen in outborn neonates in the first week of life but not in inborns: Salmonella, Aeromonas, and Vibrio spp. Eighty-one percent of isolates were susceptible to penicillin and/or gentamicin and 84% to ampicillin and/or gentamicin. There was a trend to increasing in vitro antimicrobial resistance to these combinations from 2008 but without a worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: IBI is common in outborn young infants admitted to rural African hospitals with a high mortality. Presumptive antimicrobial use is justified for all young infants admitted to the hospital.
TI  - Etiology and outcome of community-acquired lung abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaerobes are the first and Streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (CALA) in the West. The etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in Taiwan, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of CALA. OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 Japanese adult patients with CALA to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. We used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle aspiration and protected specimen brushes. RESULTS: Of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. Pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. The four most common etiologic pathogens were Streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), Gemella species (9.8%), and K. pneumoniae (8.2%). Streptococcus mitis was the most common among the Streptococcus species. Mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. Six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. Two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. CONCLUSIONS: The first and second most common etiologic pathogens of CALA in our hospital were Streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. The etiologies in our study differ from those in Taiwan and are similar to those in the West with the exception that Streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in Western countries. S. mitis and Gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. The identification of Actinomyces and Nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Alpinia galanga (L) Willd crude extracts.
AB  - Methanol, acetone and diethyl ether extracts of Alpinia galanga have been evaluated against pathogens viz. Bacillus subtilis MTCC 2391, Enterobacter aerogene, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli MTCC 1563, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 6642, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus epidermis using Agar well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of all the extracts were determined using the macrodilution method. Methanol extracts have shown excellent activity towards all the pathogens with MIC and MBC values ranging from 0.04-1.28 mg/ml and 0.08-2.56 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS analysis of methanol extracts have yielded compounds like 5-hydroxymethyl furfural (59.9%), benzyl alcohol (57.6%), 1,8 cineole (15.65%), methylcinnamate (9.4%), 3-phenyl-2-butanone (8.5%) and 1,2 benzenedicarboxylic acid (8.9%), which could be responsible for its broad spectrum activity. So, A. galanga can be quite resourceful for the development of new generation drugs.
TI  - Anterior sacral pyocele with meningitis: a rare presentation of occult spinal dysraphism with congenital dermal sinus.
AB  - The authors describe an interesting case of a hitherto asymptomatic occult spinal defect with a congenital sacral dermal sinus which proved to be the entry point for bacterial meningitis in an otherwise healthy 9-year-old female child. The patient presented with fever and neck stiffness, and a dermal sinus in the lumbosacral region was identified on examination. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis confirmed bacterial meningitis and a spinal magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed a dermal sinus tract with an anterior spinal meningocele, caudal regression syndrome, and a tethered spinal cord. In addition to administration of intravenous antimicrobial agents, surgical exploration of the sacral dermal sinus tract was performed and an anterior sacral pyocele was drained. The pyocele cavity was disconnected from the thecal sac, and the thickened and fatty filum terminale was sectioned. Although congenital sacral dermal sinus manifesting as bacterial meningitis is known, the occurrence of an anterior sacral pyocele has not yet been described in children.
TI  - [Microbiological etiology in children with community acquired pneumonia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. METHODS: Respiratory secretion and blood specimens were collected in 1167 children with CAP within 4 hrs of admission. Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia trachomatis were detected by RT-PCR in respiratory secretion specimens. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-IgM) and Adenovirus (ADV-IgM) were tested using ELISA in blood samples. RESULTS: A total of 308 strains of bacteria were isolated from the respiratory tract secretions, with gram positive strains of 53.6% and gram negative strains of 46.4%. The top five bacteria strains detected were Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.1%), Escherichia coli (11.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.8%), Klebsiella pneumonia (6.5%) and Moraxelle catarrhalis (5.8%) in turn. Beta-lactamase and ESBLs producing strains accounted for 30.1% in the top five bacteria strains. The non-bacteria pathogens were found in 281 specimens (24.1%). Respiratory syncytial virus accounted for the most prevalent pathogen (19.3%). The mixed infection of respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae was common (35.2%). The infection rate from most of pathogenic microorganisms among children under the age of one was higher than that in children over one year old. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory syncytial virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the major pathogens of CAP in children. The risk of pathogenic microorganism infections in children under the age of one is higher than that of children over one year old.
TI  - In situ polytetrafluoroethylene graft bypass for primary infected aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reinfection is a major issue of surgical treatment for patients with  infected abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The present report describes outcomes after use of our procedure for treating patients with infected aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. The procedure involved an in situ polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft bypass and omental wrapping of the graft. The procedure was used regardless of the presence of Gram-stain-positive pus or tissue or the type of pathogen identified. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed nine consecutive patients with primary infected aneurysms of the infrarenal abdominal aorta treated from June 2001 to August 2006 at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. Diagnosis was based on preoperative abdominopelvic CT scans. Treatment involved removal of all infected tissue, including infected aorta tissue, in situ PTFE graft reconstruction, and wrapping of the graft with retrocolically transposed great omentum. Sensitive antibiotics were administered before and after the operation. RESULTS: In all cases, aneurysms were the result of aortitis and aortic wall perforation, and presented as aortic pseudoaneurysms with rupture. The pathogens identified were Salmonella non-typhi (n = 4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), Citrobacter freundii (n = 1), and Brucella abortus (n = 1). There was no infection-related morbidity or mortality during a median follow-up period of 49 months. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment comprising complete removal of all infected tissue, in situ PTFE graft reconstruction, and omental wrapping of the graft was effective in treating infected AAA. Key adjunct procedures were a precise preoperative diagnosis using abdominopelvic CT scans, and pre- and postoperative sensitive antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine derivatives as  antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-cyclopropyl-1H-pyrazol-5-amine benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized to determine their antibacterial and antifungal activities as well as possible structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve therapeutic efficacy. The pyrazol-5-amine benzamides were screened for their antibacterial activity against standard strains of Gram-positive (Streptococcus pyogenes NCIM 2608, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29737, Bacillus subtilis NCIM 2010) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 20852, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 618) bacteria by using streptomycin as positive control. They were also tested for their antifungal activities against mycotoxic strains of Fusarium verticillioides, Aspergillus ochraceous, Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, and Penicillium chrysogenum using nystatin as positive control. Among the synthesized compounds, 9d, 9g, and 9h showed potent antimicrobial activities.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for diabetic foot infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparative antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 1828 primary baseline pathogens isolated from 844 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trials investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in diabetic foot infection (DFI). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 30 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in DFI, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with 95% of MICs < or =2 microg/mL for the entire collection. The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens for DFI, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. As reported previously, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and several pathogens in the Proteeae group were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other Gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with DFIs.
TI  - Resistance to antibiotics in urinopathogenic bacteria isolated in patients attending Kenyatta University Health Clinic, Nairobi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the aetiological bacterial agents of urinary tract infections, within communities in Kenyatta University, and current resistance levels to commonly available therapeutic agents. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey research design. SETTING: Kenyatta University Health Services Clinic, Nairobi. SUBJECTS: Outpatients with symptoms of urinary tract infection within the six months study duration were observed. RESULTS: Females were particularly prone to have confirmed cases of UTI. Escherichia coli were the principle aetiological agent accounting for 61.7% of the isolates. Other bacterial agents were Enterobacter agglomerans (18.7%), Citrobacter diversus (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.3%), Proteus spp. (2.1%), Pseudomonas spp. (0.1%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (9.3%), and Streptococcus feacalis (0.7%). Over 60% of the Gram negative bacterial isolates were resistant to cotrimoxazole and ampicillin, 39% resistant to augmentin and 25% were resistant to nalidixic acid. The ceftazidime was the most efficacious antimicrobial with an Escherichia coli resistance level of 2.2% (P=0.05). Resistance to nitrofuraintoin, gentamicin, cefuroxime, norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin was demonstrated in less than 15% of the bacterial isolates. CONCLUSION: The cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, nitrofurantoin and gentamicin have good efficacy against the uropathogenic bacteria and may be good therapeutic choices when culture results are unavailable. High resistance levels exist against cotrimoxazole, ampicillin, augmentin, and nalidixic acid. These later antibiotics should therefore be used against the uropathogenic bacteria with caution.
TI  - Wound healing properties and kill kinetics of Clerodendron splendens G. Don, a Ghanaian wound healing plant.
AB  - As part of our general objective of investigating indigenous plants used in wound healing in Ghana, we hereby report our findings from some in vitro and in vivo studies related to wound healing activities of Clerodendron splendens G. Don (Verbanaceae). Methanolic extract of the aerial parts of the plant was tested for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, as well as resistant strains of Staph. aureus SA1199B, RN4220 and XU212), Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteous mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Candida albicans using the micro-well dilution method. Survivor-time studies of the microorganisms, radical scavenging activity using 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and various in vivo wound healing activity studies were also conducted on the extract. The extract exhibited biostatic action against all the test microorganisms with a Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) ranging between 64 and 512 mug/ml and a free radical scavenging property with an IC(50) value of 103.2 mug/ml. The results of the in vivo wound healing tests showed that upon application of C. splendens ointment, there was a reduction in the epithelization period from 26.7 days (control) to 13.6 days along with a marked decrease in the scar area from 54.2 mm(2) (control) to 25.2 mm(2). Significant increase in the tensile strength and hydroxyproline content were also observed as compared to the control and was comparable to nitrofurazone. The above results appear to justify the traditional use of C. splendens in wound healing and treatment of skin infections in Ghana.
TI  - Microbiology and epidemiology of brain abscess and subdural empyema in a medical  center: a 10-year experience.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain abscess and subdural empyema are the 2 most common  forms of intracranial pyogenic infections. Predisposing factors and etiological agents may change with time. This study examined the epidemiological features of these conditions. METHODS: The medical records of all inpatients with a diagnosis of brain abscess or subdural empyema from 1998 to 2007 were reviewed. The diagnosis was confirmed by imaging study or operative findings. RESULTS: 151 episodes of brain abscess were diagnosed in 150 patients, and 10 patients had subdural empyema. The incidence of brain abscess fluctuated over time, while that of subdural empyema remained stable. The mean +/- standard deviation age of patients with brain abscess was significantly greater than that of patients with subdural empyema (48.5 +/- 19 years vs 25.4 +/- 24 years; p = 0.004). The number of patients with hematogenous brain abscess increased from 7 in 1998 to 2002 to 19 in 2003 to 2007, while that of those with infection related to operation decreased from 10 to 5. Most subdural empyema was related to bacterial meningitis (4 of 10). Etiological agents were identified in 53% of brain abscesses, including Enterobacteriaceae spp. (21.3%), Streptococcus spp. (20%), and mixed pathogens (17.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common enteric bacteria isolated (15.3%), especially in patients with diabetes mellitus, but was not observed in children younger than 18 years. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to western countries, K. pneumoniae plays an important role in intracranial pyogenic infections in Taiwan. The pathogens and routes of infection are different between children and adults.
TI  - [Urinary pneumococcal or Legionella antigen detection tests and low-spectrum antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - We performed urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus and Legionella for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), to prescribe a documented antibiotic therapy. We report the efficiency of low-spectrum antibiotic treatment, illustrating the inappropriateness of bacteriological respiratory sampling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with CAP were enrolled from three different units; the pneumonia severity index was used to assess the disease. Respiratory samples were also listed. Low-spectrum antibiotic therapy was amoxicillin for pneumococcal infection, and macrolides or non-anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone for legionellosis. RESULTS: Six hundred and seventy-five CAP were diagnosed during the study period,, 150 with positive urinary antigen tests (23%), among which 108 pneumococcal infections (73%), 40 legionellosis (26%), and two mixed infections. The pneumonia severity index was 106+/-38. Amoxicillin was prescribed in 108 cases, fluoroquinolone in 24 cases, macrolide in 18 cases. The outcome was favourable for 138 patients (92%). Eighty three respiratory samples allowed identification of a bacterium for 58 patients (39%), among which 24 strains were not in the antibiotic spectrum: Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudmomonas aeruginosa in six cases, Staphylococcus aureus in five cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases, and another Gram negative bacillus in five cases. These strains were resistant in vitro to the prescribed treatment in 19/24 cases (79%). One out of 12 patients who died had a respiratory sample positive for Enterobacter spp strain resistant to the ongoing antibiotic treatment. CONCLUSION: The low-spectrum antibiotic therapy based on urinary antigen tests is efficient, and demonstrates respiratory tract colonisation with bacteriological strains usually considered as pathogenic.
TI  - Sialidase-based anti-influenza virus therapy protects against secondary pneumococcal infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: DAS181 (Fludase) is a sialidase fusion protein in clinical development as a broad-spectrum anti-influenza virus (IFV) therapeutic agent. Previous reports by other investigators have raised the concern that desialylation of airway epithelium might increase susceptibility to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. METHODS: To address whether DAS181 would lead to an increased risk of pneumococcal infection, we tested S. pneumoniae colonization after DAS181 treatment of human A549 cells, healthy mice, and mice challenged with a lethal dose of IFV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2), followed by 10(4) cfu of S. pneumoniae (D39) on day 3 or day 7. DAS181 treatment was given 24-48 h after IFV challenge. RESULTS: DAS181 treatment did not increase S. pneumoniae colonization in vitro or in vivo in healthy animals. In IFV-infected mice, DAS181 prevented pneumonia and significantly prolonged survival and inhibited the IFV titer by > or = 3 logs. None of the treated animals showed enhanced S. pneumoniae colonization of the lung. In addition, opportunistic infections with Citrobacter species or Klebsiella species occurred only in mice receiving vehicle, not in animals treated with DAS181. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that DAS181 treatment does not exacerbate secondary bacterial infection in mice. DAS181 may reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection by inhibiting IFV.
TI  - Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis.
AB  - Bovine tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium bovis is an important zoonosis. In this study, a simple, rapid method for detecting this organism was developed based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification of the mpt83 gene. The technique will be of value in the clinical and field-based diagnosis of M. bovis and can differentiate it from other bacteria such as Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The limit of detection was 10 copies/muL and the results were corroborated by PCR. The method was highly specific and more sensitive than PCR.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of doripenem and other carbapenems against clinically important bacteria isolated in intensive care units: nationwide data from the SMART Programme.
AB  - This nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan investigated the susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from September through November 2005. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2005 guidelines. Doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of MICs) in vitro activity to meropenem for Enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (NFGNBs), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Burkholderia cepacia. Among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates. However, the meropenem MIC(90) against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. Besides, doripenem with the MIC(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to Streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. Because of the heavy resistance burden in Taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.
TI  - [Factors effecting the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease with high morbidity and mortality. In this study, demographic features, underlying conditions, causative pathogens and factors affecting length of hospital stay and mortality were retrospectively investigated in patients who were diagnosed as CAP and followed-up in our unit between January 2005-December 2007. Among 97 patients 65 (67%) were male, 32 (33%) were female and the mean age was 62.7 (age range: 18-94) years. Patients were grouped according to criteria of Turkish Thoracic Society into four groups; 22 were group 2 (patients with risk factors, without aggrevating factors), 59 were group 3 (patients with aggrevating factors), and 16 were group 4 (patients who have necessity for intensive care) CAP. The patients have also been grouped according to criteria of American Thoracic Society (CURB-65 score = Confusion, Urea > 7 mmol/L, Respiratory rate > or = 30/min, low Blood pressure and being > or = 65 years old), as group I (n = 65), group II (n = 20), and group III (n = 12). During follow-up 11 (11.3%) patients required mechanical ventilation support and 6 (6.2%) patients have died. Causative pathogens were isolated from 14 (23.3%) out of 27 well-qualified sputum samples obtained from 60 patients who could produce sputum (8 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Haemophilus influenzae, 1 Moraxella catarrhalis). Thirty-seven of cases were treated with levofloxacin, 10 with moxifloxacin, 24 with ceftriaxone +/- clarithromycin, 16 with sulbactam-ampicillin +/- ciprofloxacin, 10 with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and fever declined within 2.5 days in 83 (85.6%) of them. The mean duration of hospital stay was estimated as 11.1 days. In the evaluation of the factors that affect the length of hospital stay, being > or = 65 years old, gender, underlying conditions, central venous catheterisation, presence of nasogastric tube, positive culture result, previous antibiotic treatment, fever continuing for > 3 days despite antibiotic therapy and scoring groups were not determined as risk factors (p > 0.05 for all of these parameters). However, mechanical ventilation was found as a significant risk factor (p < 0.05). In the evaluation of the factors that affect mortality, mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001), staying in intensive care unit (p < 0.001), being group 4 CAP (p < 0.001) and fever continuing for > 3 days despite antibiotic therapy (p = 0.05) were found to be significant risk factors. In conclusion, length of hospital stay, mortality and treatment costs in CAP patients could be reduced by defining the risk factors and starting empirical antibiotic therapy according to the national and international guidelines.
TI  - Autoimmune diseases: Solution of the environmental, immunological and genetic components with principles for immunotherapy and transplantation.
AB  - Autoimmune diseases have environmental and genetic components. These are the microbial trigger, the immunity system component and the genetic component. Here we describe these components and how they interact. Known microbial triggers are Streptococcus pyogenes for rheumatic carditis, Proteus mirabilis for rheumatoid arthritis and Klebsiella pneumoniae for ankylosing spondylitis. The immunity system component has been clarified by realisation that no autoimmune disease is caused by loss of suppressor T cells. This leaves Burnet's forbidden clones, clearly seen in Graves' disease, as the immunological defect. With wide scope for clonal diversification by somatic gene mutations, to prevent frequent autoimmunity the immunity system is policed by the histocompatibility system. This dictates the immune response repertoire by deleting complementary clones (H Gene Theory). We show molecular evidence of how specific histocompatibility antigens can predispose to an autoimmune disease by influencing choice of the microbial antigen to which the immunity system reacts. Because of the unlucky random element in the somatic mutations involved in their development, forbidden clones are unlikely to reappear in new immune repertoires developing after immune ablation and autologous bone marrow cell reconstitution, as observed clinically. Isolation of autoantigens and their attachment to cytotoxic moieties could provide specific immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases. Kaplans's discovery that xenografts can be accepted without rejection after immune ablation followed by autologous and xenogeneic bone marrow inoculation, could enable widespread use of pig grafts for humans.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of H1N1 pandemic influenza.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.
TI  - Microbial aetiologic agents associated with pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patients. The aim of this study was to determine the etiologic agents and predisposing factors associated with pneumonia infections in immunocompromised patients. Cross-sectional survey of 100 immunocompromised patients due to HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections were enlisted for the study. The patients completed a structured questionnaire to abstract information on demographic features and risk factors. Sputum samples were collected from the patients with clinical suspicion of having pneumonia and the sputa examined by cultural methods. The tuberculosis patients had the highest number of isolates, 119 (70%) while those with co-infections of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis had 41(24.1%) and those with only HIV infection were 10 (5.9%). The distribution of isolates were as follows, Staphylococcus aureus 63 (37.9%), Streptococcus pyogenes 44 (25.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae 27 (15.9%), Candida albicans 24 (14.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae 7 (4.1%), Proteus mirabilis 4 (2.4%) and Escherichia coli 1 (0.5%). Those with previous history of alcoholism and tobacco smoking had relatively high isolates. This study demonstrated that secondary infections are prevalent in the immunocompromised patients due to HIV/AIDS and TB or co-infection with TB/HIV-AIDS. This may lead to drug resistance, DOTS or HAART programme, thereby leading to high mortality and morbidity.
TI  - [Epidemio-clinical aspects of adult acute bacterial pneumonia at Yalgado Ouedraogo University Health Center].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial Pneumopathies are low respiratory infections due to parenchyma pulmonary attack, which etiologic agent is a bacteria different from tubercular bacillus. Factually, the treatment is based on a probalistic antibiotherapy. This requires awareness of the epidemiology of the germs which are responsible in a given region, at a given period. PATIENTS AND METHOD: In order to better grasp mainly the bacteriological and therapeutic aspects of adult bacterial Pneumopathies in Burkina Faso, we have come up with a two year journal/documentary. RESULTS: The reported most frequent germs are respectively: Streptococcus pneumoniae (32,6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%) et Staphylococcus aureus (13,9%). Negative Gram bacteries represented 53.5% of isolated germ and Acinetobacter was found only with HIV positive patients. The streptococcus was sensitive to association amoxicilline + clavulanic in 91.7% of the cases, to ceftriaxone in 83.3% of cases, to ampicilline and to amoxicilline in 66.7% of cases The clinical evolution of our patients was favorable in 74.5% of the cases with 21.8% deaths. The evolution was more significant within alcoholic patients (p = 0.001) as well as tobacco addicted patients (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The high morbi-morbidity due to acute pneumopathy could be improved through a better awareness and regular updating of local bacterial ecology.
TI  - [Epidemio-clinical aspects of bacterial acute infant Pneumopathies at Yalgado Ouedraogo University Health Center].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections of low respiratory tracks represent a public health issue and are a frequent reason for antibiotic prescription . For children in Africa, they are the main morbidity factor (50% of visits) and mortality (about 20% of infant mortality). Actually, the antibiotherapy, mainly probabilistic, rests on the awareness of the epidemiology of the germs which are responsible in a given region, at a given period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Epidemio-clinical aspects of bacterial acute infant Pneumopathies at Yalgado Ouedraogo Univercity Health Center. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This a descriptive retrospective study, base on the files of hospitalized patients in the Paediatric Unit of CHU YO from January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2006. RESULTS: All in all, 5803 patients with 658 cases of acute bacterial pneumopathy (11.3%) were hospitalized in the paediatric unit. Besides, acute bacterial Pneumopathies, 254 patients had another associated affection. Proteino-calorific malnutrition were frequent (59.7%), coupled with anaemia (36%). The reported most frequent germs are respectively: Streptococcus pneumoniae (29.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (29.3%) et Staphylococcus aureus (25%). The streptococcus was sensitive to association amoxicilline + clavulanic in 66.7% of the cases, to ceftriaxone in 57.1 % of cases. It was 100% resistant to ampicilline and to amoxicilline. The clinical evolution of our patients was favorable in 90% of the cases with 5.5% deaths. CONCLUSION: Pneumopathies affect mostly children who are less than 2 years old favored by malnutrition and anaemia. The high morbid-morbidity related to this pathology could be improved through a better awareness and regular updating of local bacterial ecology.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from more than 10,000 patients with infectious respiratory diseases: a 25-year longitudinal study.
AB  - The Study Group on Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Pathogens Isolated from Respiratory Infections was established in 1981 in Japan to elucidate trends in such susceptibilities in patients with infectious respiratory diseases; the Group has conducted nationwide research in collaboration with 21 medical institutions. Examination of more than 10,000 patients by 2005 allowed a summary of study findings. Streptococcus pneumoniae started to become resistant to penicillin G in the 1990s, and the isolation rate of penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP + PRSP) reached almost 60% in 2001. The proportion of PRSP also increased, reaching 19.4%. Thereafter, the rate of PISP + PRSP decreased somewhat to the mid-30% range. Macrolide resistance was also observed; in 2005, the prevalence of strains highly susceptible to erythromycin with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml had decreased to 15.5%, whereas the proportion of highly resistant strains with MICs >or= 128 microg/ml exceeded 40%. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, the proportion of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains began to increase rapidly in 1986 and constituted around 60% of all S. aureus strains identified in 1990 and in the following years. In 1993, the prevalence of ampicillin-resistant isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had increased remarkably, presumably related to the outbreak of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae strains, and the proportion of these strains among the isolates surpassed 30% in 2002 and thereafter. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of first- to fourth-generation cephems improved with each generation. The MIC distribution patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa shifted towards higher MICs when compared with the MICs for other pathogens. Broad patterns with no distinct peaks reflected the difficulty in treating P. aeruginosa infection. Regarding Moraxella catarrhalis, beta-lactamase-producing strains already constituted a majority of the isolates in 1990, and the proportion of strains highly susceptible to ampicillin, with MICs <or= 0.06 microg/ml, was less than 10% at that time.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - [Analysis on the sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of respiratory-infectious isolates on the second survey on the sensitivity of isolates conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007--concerning the aspect of PK/PD break points].
AB  - Sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics of isolates clinically obtained from respiratory infection sites in adults on the second survey on sensitivity of isolates conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007 was investigated according to the classification of the "Guideline for treatment for adult nosocomial pneumonia in 2008". Among the primary antibacterial drugs for mild (A) and moderate (B) nosocomial pneumonia in adults, beta-lactam antibiotics; ceftriaxone (CTRX), sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC), panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP), tazobactam/piperacillin (TAZ/PIPC), imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS), meropenem (MEPM), doripenem (DRPM), biapenem (BIPM) were studied to evaluate their clinical efficacy. The covering rate was analyzed using the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and break point of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD). Consequently, the results with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae revealed the MIC90 of all antibacterial drugs to be at low levels, while almost 100% of isolates were within the range of PK/PD break points except BIPM and SBT/ABPC to H. influenzae, and SBT/ABPC to K. pneumoniae. However, the analysis of P. aeruginosa didn't reach 100% for the covering rates of isolates, indicating that these drugs did not have a complete inhibitory action to restrict bacterial proliferation. The analysis of all 5 carbapenem drugs showed superiority to TAZ/PIPC in MIC90 while covering rates of isolates at PK/PD break points showed inferiority to TAZ/PIPC. This tendency was found to be more significant in covering the rates of isolates on the regular dose with maximal bactericidal action and on the maximum dose. This is because the maximum dose approved in Japan is as low as half that in IPM/CS and 1/3 that in MEPM in Western countries.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of quinolones against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activities of oral quinolones, ciprofloxacin (CPFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), garenoxacin (GRNX), levofloxacin (LVFX), moxifloxacin (MFLX), norfloxacin (NFLX), prulifloxacin (PUFX), and tosufloxacin (TFLX) using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, extended spectrum beta-lactamase(ESBL) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolated from clinical materials. Based on the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics theory, the target attainment rate at the area under the curve (AUC)/MIC of 120 or more for Gram-negative and 30 or more for Gram-positive bacteria was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and was assessed as the efficacy. GRNX showed the lowest MIC50 and MIC90 values (0.03 and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively) against S. pneumoniae, suggesting its potent antimicrobial activity. GRNX also exhibited the most potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, MSSA) other than S. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of CPFX against H. influenzae was most potent. The MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.016 microg/ml each. However, the MIC50 and MIC90 values of the other agents were also favorable. PUFX showed the most potent antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. Both of MIC50 and MIC90 values were 0.06 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. On efficacy assessment using MCS, GRNX, GFLX, and MFLX showed a probability of 90% or more against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Against S. agalactiae, GRNX, MFLX, and GFLX showed a probability of approximately 60%. All agents showed a low probability against ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; PUFX showed a maximum (43.63%). GRNX, MFLX, GFLX, and LVFX showed a probability of 90% or more against MSSA. Furthermore, we investigated the probability that the target value of resistance inhibition, an AUC/MIC of more than 200 against S. pneumoniae, is achieved. GRNX showed the highest probability (95.05%). It also exhibited a similar probability even when the target value was established as 250. Recently, the widespread use of quinolones has increased the number of quinolone-resistant bacteria. In the future, antimicrobial agents should be selected with respect to more potent therapeutic effects and resistance inhibition, and an appropriate dose and administration method must be employed.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between April 2007 and March 2008].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2007 to March 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, Anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both Bacteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, B. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by B. fragilis, Bacteroides caccae and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. There were nine strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which show higher MIC against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/mL, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 2423 clinical isolates and comparison of the available interpretation breakpoints.
AB  - MICs to tigecycline and 12 antimicrobials were performed by microdilution method, against 2423 nonduplicate pathogens recently isolated in 17 Greek hospitals. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria were used comparatively for interpretation of tigecycline MICs. Tigecycline exhibited potent in vitro activity against the majority of the isolates tested. (MIC(90) values of 0.5, 1, 2, 0.125, 1, 0.25, 0.125, and 1 mg/L were observed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, respectively.) Tigecycline activity was the same, irrespective of the resistance profile to other antimicrobials (Gram-negative pathogens susceptible or resistant to imipenem, Enterococcus spp., S. aureus, or S. pneumoniae isolates, susceptible or resistant to vancomycin, methicillin or penicillin, respectively). Interpretation using EUCAST and FDA breakpoints differed among isolates of K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. having tigecycline MICs of 2 to 4 mg/L. In conclusion, tigecycline exhibited potent activity against pathogens recently isolated in a region that experiences high antimicrobial resistance rates. Indications that the available criteria might categorize differently tigecycline susceptibility status in K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. isolates were also detected.
TI  - Summary trends for the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection Program: a 10-year experience in the United States (1999-2008).
AB  - The Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program  was a global, longitudinal antimicrobial resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of meropenem and selected other broad-spectrum comparator agents. In 1999, and from 2000 through 2008, a total of 10 or 15 United States (USA) medical centers each forwarded 200 nonduplicate clinical isolates from serious infections to a central processing laboratory. Over the 10-year period of this surveillance program, the activity of meropenem and an average of 11 other antimicrobial agents were assessed against a total of 27 289 bacterial isolates using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference methods. Meropenem consistently demonstrated low resistance rates against Enterobacteriaceae species isolates through 2008 and did not exhibit a widespread change in resistance rates over the monitored interval. In fact, the incidence of emerging carbapenemase-producing (KPC-type) Klebsiella spp. showed a decline in 2008 compared to the steeply increasing rates observed from 2004 to 2007. Moreover, the KPC serine carbapenemases have spread to other Enterobacteriaceae species monitored by the MYSTIC Program. Greatest increases in antimicrobial resistance rates were observed for the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) among all species monitored by the MYSTIC Program. Current susceptibility rates for meropenem when tested against prevalent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (439 strains, 85.4% susceptible), Enterobacteriaceae (1537 strains, 97.3% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (460 strains, 100.0% susceptible), Streptococcus pneumoniae (125 strains, 80.2% at meningitis susceptibility breakpoints), other streptococci (159 strains, 90.0-100.0% susceptible), and Acinetobacter spp. (127 strains, 45.7% susceptible), the widest spectrum among beta-lactams tested in 2008 and throughout the last decade. Continued local surveillance of broad-spectrum agents following the completion of the MYSTIC Program (USA) appears critical to detect emerging resistances among pathogens causing the most serious infections requiring carbapenem agents.
TI  - Necrotising fasciitis of the extremity.
AB  - Necrotising fasciitis is a rare, life-threatening infection where there is necrosis of fascia, subcutaneous tissues and skin. Three adult patients presented with this condition affecting the extremities and all had predisposing medical factors. Each one complained of severe pain that seemed disproportionate to the skin affected. They underwent prompt surgical debridement and received antibiotic treatment and supportive therapy. These cases highlight the increasing incidence and differences in presentation of necrotising fasciitis, as well as the important symptom of pain. Patients can become moribund and require intensive care support. High mortality rates are well recognised.
TI  - Bacteriology of external ocular infections in Aba, South Eastern Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria are microbial agents that frequently cause infections of the eye and possible loss of vision. METHOD: The common isolates were studied in 298 bacterial infections of the anterior eye, consisting of 35 blepharitis, 208 conjunctivitis and 55 keratitis. Isolates were cultured in blood agar and chocolate agar. Each strain's susceptibility to the antibiotics was determined using a standard table of antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: In decreasing order of frequency, the implicated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus 80 (23.7 per cent), Staphylococcus albus 65 (19.2 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 34 (10.1 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae 29 (8.6 per cent), Haemophilus influenzae 26 (7.7 per cent), Streptococcus pyogene 20 (6.2 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 18 (6.2 per cent), Escherichia coli 15 (4.4 per cent), Neisseria gonorrhoeae 13 (3.9 per cent), Streptococcus viridans 11 (3.5 per cent), Moraxella catarrhalis 10 (3.0 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis 5 (1.5 per cent), Proteus mirabilis 5 (1.5 per cent) and Neisseria meningitides 1 (0.3 per cent). Bacteria were isolated most frequently from infections of the conjunctiva (222, 66.7 per cent), then the cornea (65, 20.1 per cent) and least from the eyelids (44, 13.2 per cent). Bacterial isolates varied in their clinical features (p < 0.01). The age distribution showed isolations of 77 (23.2 per cent) and 79 (23.7 per cent) in the age groups of newborn to under three years and three to under 12 years, respectively. This was comparable to 66 (19.8 per cent) for the 12 to under 18 years, 61 (18.3 per cent) for the 18 to under 40 years age group and 50 (15 per cent) for those 40 years and above. Bacterial isolates had no predilection for the age of patients (p < 0.95). Conjunctivitis was diagnosed more in children, 60 (28.8 per cent) in the newborn to under three years and 53 (25.5 per cent) in the three to under 12 years age groups. Blepharitis was diagnosed most frequently (15, 42.8 per cent) in adolescents 12 to under 18 years, while keratitis was more in adults (20, 36.4 per cent) in the 18 to under 40 years and (15, 27.3 per cent) in the 40 years and above. Diagnosis varied among age groups but there was no relationship between sex and diagnosis (p < 0.75). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most resistant to all the anti-bacterial preparations. The bacterial isolates were more susceptible to the second generation quinolones than the first. CONCLUSION: The study recommends that quinolones be available as ophthalmic preparations to be prescribed by the qualified practitioners to avoid development of resistance from indiscriminate use.
TI  - Pneumonia in severely malnourished children in developing countries - mortality risk, aetiology and validity of WHO clinical signs: a systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To quantify the degree by which moderate and severe degrees of malnutrition increase the mortality risk in pneumonia, to identify potential differences in the aetiology of pneumonia between children with and without severe malnutrition, and to evaluate the validity of WHO-recommended clinical signs (age-specific fast breathing and chest wall indrawing) for the diagnosis of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. METHODS: Systematic search of the existing literature using a variety of databases (Medline, EMBASE, the Web of Science, Scopus and CINAHL). RESULTS: Mortality risk: Sixteen relevant studies were identified, which universally showed that children with pneumonia and moderate or severe malnutrition are at higher risk of death. For severe malnutrition, reported relative risks ranged from 2.9 to 121.2; odds ratios ranged from 2.5 to 15.1. For moderate malnutrition, relative risks ranged from 1.2 to 36.5. Aetiology: Eleven studies evaluated the aetiology of pneumonia in severely malnourished children. Commonly isolated bacterial pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus influenzae. The spectrum and frequency of organisms differed from those reported in children without severe malnutrition. There are very few data on the role of respiratory viruses and tuberculosis. Clinical signs: Four studies investigating the validity of clinical signs showed that WHO-recommended clinical signs were less sensitive as predictors of radiographic pneumonia in severely malnourished children. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumonia and malnutrition are two of the biggest killers in childhood. Guidelines for the care of children with pneumonia and malnutrition need to take into account this strong and often lethal association if they are to contribute to the UN Millennium Development Goal 4, aiming for substantial reductions in childhood mortality. Additional data regarding the optimal diagnostic approach to and management of pneumonia and malnutrition are required from regions where death from these two diseases is common.
TI  - Description of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. METHODS: We performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for S. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from March 2003 through June 2008. RESULTS: Of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). Patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). This group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. Most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. Two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the burn population. It should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.
TI  - Prognostic serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha in paediatric patients with sepsis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the association of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in paediatric patients with different etiological agents and levels of sepsis. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-nine patients with sepsis were studied. Blood cultures, along with other relevant specimens, were processed for bacterial and fungal etiology. TNF-alpha was detected by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: In total, 42 (53.2%) of the patients had a microbiologically documented cause for sepsis. Of the gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter spp. Serratia marscecens as well as Citrobacter koseri. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus predominated among the gram-positive cocci. Patients with a positive culture had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than patients with a negative culture (70 pg/ml vs. 33 pg/ml p = 0.01). Patients with a pure gram-negative infection had significantly higher TNF-alpha levels than those with pure gram-positive infection (83 pg/ml vs.52 pg/ml). The geometric mean TNF-alpha concentrations in patients with severe sepsis and those with late septic shock were 47 pg/ml (range 5-2720) and 59 pg/ml (range 5-3310) respectively. CONCLUSION: TNF-alpha was significantly raised in culture-positive cases in general and in gram-negative infections in particular. It can be used as a surrogate marker of sepsis and aggressive treatment initiated in patients with elevated levels of TNF alpha.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - The clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat serious infections. The major success of the seven-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. The almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community Escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the United States, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. Finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic characterization and antibacterial activity of new cobalt(II) complexes of unsymmetrical tetradentate (OSN2) Schiff base ligands.
AB  - Cobalt ion complexes with the Schiff bases, (4-X-2-{[2-(2-pyridine-2-yl-ethylsulfanyl)ethylimino]methyl}phenol (X=methoxy (OMe), phenylazo (N(2)Ph), bromo (Br), nitro (NO(2))),were synthesized and investigated by several techniques using elemental analysis (C, H, N), FTIR, electronic spectra and molar conductivity. The thermal stability of free ligands and related cobalt complexes were studied by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). Cyclic voltammetry indicates that the investigated cobalt complexes, under the experimental conditions, have irreversible redox behavior. The synthesized compounds have antibacterial activity against the four Gram-positive bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis and also against the two Gram-negative bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity data show that the parent Schiff bases are more potent antibacterials than the cobalt complexes.
TI  - Factor analysis of microbiological activity data and structural parameters of antibacterial quinolones.
AB  - Factor analysis (FA) was performed on quinolone derivatives with antibacterial activity to model relationships between molecular descriptors and microbiological activities determined on five bacterial cell lines (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Molecular modeling studies were performed with the use of HyperChem software and MM+ molecular mechanics with the semi-empirical AM1 method. Factor analysis led to the extraction of two main factors, with the share of factor 1 amounting to about 76% and factor 2 to about 24% for all the parameters used in the statistical analysis. Moreover, FA results indicated that energy of orbitals lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, energy of ionization, electron affinity, electronegativity, maximum electron density, refraction and polarizability appeared to be descriptors important for the antibacterial activity of quinolones.
TI  - Nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy in 2007: general view of the pathogens' antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - For the purpose of a nationwide surveillance of the antimicrobial susceptibility  of bacterial respiratory pathogens in patients in Japan, the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy conducted their second year survey, during the period from January to August, 2007. A total of 1178 strains were collected from clinical specimens obtained from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections. Susceptibility testing was evaluable for 1108 strains (226 Staphylococcus aureus, 257 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6 Streptococcus pyogenes, 206 Haemophilus influenzae, 120 Moraxella catarrhalis, 122 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 171 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). A total of 44 antibacterial agents, including 26 beta-lactams (four penicillins, three penicillins in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors, four oral cephems, eight parenteral cephems, one monobactam, five carbapenems, and one penem), three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, six fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone were used for the study. Analysis was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The incidence of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was high, at 59.7%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediateresistant and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP and PRSP) were 30.4% and 5.1%, respectively. Among Haemophilus influenzae strains, 19.9% of them were found to be beta-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately-resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamasenon-producing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 6.7% to be beta-lactamase-producing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was not isolated. Two isolates (1.2%) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains, including one (0.6%) suspected multidrug-resistant strain showing resistance to imipenem, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies and for investigations to control resistant infections as well. Continued surveillance is required to prevent the further spread of these antimicrobial resistances.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity, phenol and flavonoid contents of Thespesia  populnea flower extracts.
AB  - Flavonoids which were reported as having many pharmacological activities, antimicrobial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, chemoprevention activities and they possess strong antiproliferative effects related to inhibition of cell cycle progression and apoptosis induction. On the basis of this Thespesia populnea (L.) Sol. Ex Correa (Family-Malvaceae) was selected and it is having the major composition of flavonoids and the antibacterial activity of methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers was investigated by agar well diffusion method. Furthermore our phytochemical studies indicated that methanolic extract of Thespesia populnea flowers contains flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins and anthroquinone glycosides. Moreover the individual components were identified by thin layer chromatography and Rf value was compared with standard flavonoid quercetin. The total phenolic and flavonoid content studies were also quantified. The bacteria used for antibacterial study were Shigella flexneri (NCIM 4924), Rhodococcus terrae (NCIM 5126), Escherichiae coli (ATCC 11775), Streptococcus faecalis (NCIB 2406), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 13883),Brevibacterium luteum (NCIM 2923), Micrococcus flavum (NCIM 2376), Proteus mirabilis (NCIB 8268), Bacillus licheniformis (NCIM 2468), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 2984), Flavobacterium devorans (NCIM 2581), Shigella sonei(ATCC 29930), Shigella boydii (ATCC 8700) and Shigella dysentriae (ATCC 13313).According to our results in the lowest tested concentration of 62.5 microg/ml and 125mug/ml 7.2% of the plant extract were active, 5% active in the concentration of 250 microg/ml, 75.7% active in the concentration of 500 microg/ml and 92.8% active at the concentration of 1000 microg/ml in a dose dependent manner.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from Staphylococcus aureus and its antimicrobial activity against MRSA and MRSE.
AB  - Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) have been known to have inhibitory and bactericidal effects. Resistance to antimicrobial agents by pathogenic bacteria has emerged in recent years and is a major health problem. This report focuses on the synthesis of metallic bionanoparticles of silver using a reduction of aqueous Ag+ ion with the culture supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus. The bioreduction of the Ag+ ions in the solution was monitored in the aqueous component and the spectrum of the solution measured through ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry and characterized by atomic force microscopy. The AgNPs were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. FROM THE CLINICAL EDITOR: Silver bionanoparticles (AgNPs) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against different pathogenic organisms. The most sensitive antimicrobial activity has been observed against methicillin-resistant S. aureus followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes, whereas only moderate antimicrobial activity was seen against Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Mutant prevention concentrations of antibacterial agents to ocular pathogenic bacteria].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method to measure mutant prevention concentration (MPC) in vitro, and to measure MPC of antibacterial agents for ocular bacteria caused keratitis. METHODS: It was an experimental study. Forty strains of ocular bacteria were separated from cornea in Beijing Institute of Ophthalmology, which included 8 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the levofloxacin (LVF), ofloxacin (OFL), ciprofloxacin (CIP), norfloxacin (NFL), tobramycin (TOB) and chloromycetin (CHL) were determined by agar dilution method from National Committee of Clinical Laboratory Standard (NCCLS). The MPC were measured by accumulate-bacterial methods with bacterial population inoculated more than 1.2 x 10(10) colony forming units per milliliter with Mueller-Hinton broth and tryptic soy agar plate. With the software of SPSS 11.0, the datum such as the range of MIC, MPC, MIC90 and MPC90 were calculated, and the selection index (MPC90/ MI90) and mutant selection window (MSW) were obtained. RESULTS: The MI90 of LVF and TOB (4 mg/L) to Staphylococcus aureus strains were the lowest. CIP showed the lowest MIC90 (0.25 mg/L) to Pseudomonas aeruginosa among six kinds of antibacterial agents. The MIC90 of LVF to Staphylococcus epidermidis (256 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L) were lower than other antibacterial agents. The MPC90, MSW and the MPC90/MIC90 of levofloxacin showed lower values compared with other antibacterial medicines. From all the datum, the MIC90 of CHL was the highest and the activity was the weakest. Although the activity of LVF was higher to every kind of bacteria, CIP had the highest activity antibacterial to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The capacity of CHL and TOB was weaker than Quinolones for restricting resistant mutants on ocular bacteria. LVF had the strongest capacity for restricting resistant mutants among Quinolones. CONCLUSION: LVF has better antibacterial effects and stronger capacity for restricting the selection of resistant mutants on ocular bacteria than other antibacterial agents.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antibacterial activity of 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel 7-(4-alkoxyimino-3-amino-3-methylpiperidin-1-yl)fluoroquinolone derivatives were designed, synthesized and characterized by (1)H NMR, MS and HRMS. These fluoroquinolones were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains. All of the title compounds have considerable activity against the twelve strains, and exhibit exceptional potency in inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.06-8 microg/mL). The most active compound 17 is 4-fold more potent than levofloxacin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, 32-fold more potent than levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 16-fold more potent than IMB against K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Dark secrets behind the shimmer of contact lens: the Indian scenario.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We studied the bacteriological profile of soft contact lens and its accessories among the asymptomatic subjects and monitored the compliance level with the lens use and its cleaning protocol. FINDINGS: A total of 115 (104 daily wear and 11 extended wear) subjects using contact lens were studied. Data regarding the duration of use and frequency and method of cleaning were recorded. Contact lens, lens cases, preserving solutions and tips of solution bottles were the samples collected. The isolates were identified on the basis of their phenotypic characters. Samples from 24 subjects (21 daily wear and 3 extended wear) were found contaminated. Of the 24 contaminated cases, 23 showed medium adherence to the cleaning protocol. Contamination rate was higher among the 56 daily wear lens users who used same lens for 2 years and more, than the 48 users who used their lenses for less than 2 years. Lens case contamination was found in all the 24 cases. The bacteria isolated were Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In extended wear lens users, there was no change in microbial flora on repeating the cultures on day 7 and 14. CONCLUSION: Non-compliance with contact lens use may lead to invitation of microbial flora. The accumulation of these bacteria may act as a precursor to biofilm formation, thus colonizing the lens accessories as well. The bacteria isolated in this study were similar to the ones causing microbial keratitis thus, predisposing the otherwise asymptomatic subjects to permanent visual damage.
TI  - Comparison of clinical symptoms scored according to the National Institutes of Health chronic prostatitis symptoms index and assessment of antimicrobial treatment in patients with chronic prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - We examined a total of 194 patients over 18 years of age with chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities. The following data were obtained for each patient: clinical history--the severity of chronic prostatitis symptoms scored by a Croatian translation of the NiH CPSI questionnaire, clinical status including digitorectal examination, urethral swab specimens, and selective samples of urine and expressed prostatic secretion, according to the 4-glass localization test (meares and Stamey localization technique). Patients were treated orally with antimicrobial agents in doses and duration according to clinical practice in Croatia. An infectious etiology was determined in 169 (87%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 38 (20%), Trichomonas vaginalis in 35 (18%), Enterococcus in 36 (19%) and Escherichia coli in 35 (18%) patients. In the remaining 25 patients the following causative pathogens were found: Ureaplasma urealyticum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Comparison of symptoms scores and effect on quality of life has shown that the most severe clinical presentation of disease was recorded in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by E. coli and Enterococcus (p<0.001). Clinical success was paralleled by bacteriological eradication in chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by C. trachomatis, Enterococcus and E. coli (kappa >0.2<0.5), but not in inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome caused by T. vaginalis.
TI  - [Predisposing factors of community acquired bacterial meningitis (excluding neonates)].
AB  - Meningeal defects and primitive ENT infections are known to promote pneumococcal  meningitis. Other risk factors can be identified in the occurrence of community acquired bacterial meningitis (CABM) and play a key role either in the frequency of this kind of infection, the type of bacteria concerned, the prognosis or the risk of recurrence. Thus, epidural infiltrations are rarely responsible for staphylococcal or streptococcal meningitis. Cochlear implants are also known to increase the risk of pneumococcal meningitis. The occurrence in children of aseptic meningitis or meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus or Enterobacteriaceae is strongly suggestive of congenital spinal or cerebral anomalies (dermal sinus or spina bifida). MRI must be rapidly performed. In cases of splenectomy or asplenism, pneumococcal meningitis is common and must be prevented. According to the larger series available on this topic, age over 60, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism and immune deficiency are found to promote CABM in about 25% of cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent causative bacteria in elderly patients, in case of alcoholism, as well as Listeria monocytogenes and some Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae). L. monocytogenes is frequently isolated in immunodepressed patients and patients treated by anti-TNF molecules (infliximab notably). Finally, some genetic polyphormisms promote CABM: complement and properdin deficiencies (meningococcal meningitis), mannose-binding lectin deficiency, Fcgamma receptors alteration or interleukin-1 and IL-1R polymorphisms. Screening for such genetic disorders may be discussed in case of CABM but is mandatory in case of recurrent meningococcal infections.
TI  - Increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. METHODS: Opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. Seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. RESULTS: More opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (P < 0.05). Opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.
TI  - Early- and late-onset pneumonia: is this still a useful classification?
AB  - The choice of empirical treatment of nosocomial pneumonia in the intensive-care unit (ICU) used to rely on the interval after the start of mechanical ventilation. Nowadays, however, the question of whether in fact there is a difference in the distribution of causative pathogens is under debate. Data from 308 ICUs from the German National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System, including information on relevant pathogens isolated in 11,285 cases of nosocomial pneumonia from 1997 to 2004, were used for our evaluation. Each individual pneumonia case was allocated either to early- or to late-onset pneumonia, with three differentiation criteria: onset on the 4th day, the 5th day, or the 7th day in the ICU. The frequency of pathogens was evaluated according to these categories. A total of 5,066 additional cases of pneumonia were reported from 2005 to 2006, after the CDC criteria had been modified. From 1997 to 2004, the most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (2,718 cases, including 720 with methicillin [meticillin]-resistant S. aureus), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,837 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,305 cases), Escherichia coli (1,137 cases), Enterobacter spp. (937 cases), streptococci (671 cases), Haemophilus influenzae (509 cases), Acinetobacter spp. (493 cases), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (308 cases). The order of the four most frequent pathogens (accounting for 53.7% of all pathogens) was the same in both groups and was independent of the cutoff categories applied: S. aureus was first, followed by P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thus, the predictabilities of the occurrence of pathogens were similar for the earlier (1997-to-2004) and later (2005-to-2006) time frames. This classification is no longer helpful for empirical antibiotic therapy, since the pathogens are the same for both groups.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Surveillance of intrahospital infections at the clinic for gynaecology and obstetrics.
AB  - Intrahospital infections (IHI) and antibiotics resistance are the problems which  exist in virtually all hospitals in the world. The main aim of the present research is establishing of epidemiological surveillance over occurrence of IHI at the Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics at the University Clinical Center Tuzla and thus identifies: types of bacteria which cause IHI, types of infection according to anatomical localization and research resistance organisms causing of IHI on antimicrobial drugs. A study was implemented on all patients admitted to Clinic for Gynaecology and Obstetrics during the period of one year and who subsequently developed infection. Determination of intrahospital infections was done according to criteria defined by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from the United States. The results of our work have shown that both urinary tract infections and surgical site infections are the most frequent. As IHI causers the most found are gram-negative organisms (73,7%), such as Escherichia coli (29,8%), right after that Klebsiella pneumoniae (24,6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14%) and Proteus mirabilis (5,3%) (p<0,05). Gram-positive organisms as causers of IHI are registered in 26,3% cases. Out of that Streptococcus species are isolated in 10,5% cases, Staphylococcus aureus (8,8%) and coagulasa negative staphylococci (7%) (p>0,05). High percent resistance of bacteria was evident to beta-lactams, aminoglycosids and cephalosporin's of third generation. Gram-positive organisms were 100% sensitive to vancomycin, while gram-negative organisms manifested the high percent of sensibility to imipenem and cefepime.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients: experience over 30 years.
AB  - Clinical characteristics, etiologies, evolution, and prognostic factors of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in elderly patients are not well known. To improve this knowledge, all episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis were prospectively recorded and cases occurring in patients >or=65 years old were selected. During the period 1977-2006, 675 episodes in adults (aged >or=18 yr) were recorded, with 185 (27%) in patients aged >or=65 years old; 76 were male and 109 were female, with a mean age of 73 +/- 6 years (range, 65-93 yr). Causative microorganisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae 74, Neisseria meningitidis 49, Listeria monocytogenes 17, other streptococcal 9, Escherichia coli 6, Haemophilus influenzae 4, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus 2 each, Capnocytophaga canimorsus and Enterococcus faecalis 1 each, and unknown in 20. On admission 91% had had fever, 32% were in a coma (Glasgow Coma Scale <or=8), 9% presented with seizures, and 8% with shock. Thirty patients (16%) presented with seizures during therapy. Mortality was 58/185 (31%). Compared with patients aged 18-65 years, there were significant differences among older patients (aged >or=65 yr), who showed a higher frequency of diabetes and malignancy as underlying disease; pneumonia, otitis, and pericranial fistula as predisposing factors; and S. pneumoniae and L. monocytogenes as etiology. There were also differences in clinical presentation, complications, sequelae, and mortality. Factors independently related with mortality were age, pneumonia as a predisposing factor, coma on admission, and heart failure and seizures after therapy. Dexamethasone therapy was a protective factor. In conclusion, bacterial meningitis in elderly patients is associated with greater diagnostic difficulties and neurologic severity and more complications, as well as with increased mortality. Antiseizure prophylaxis might be useful in these patients.
TI  - Management of severe community-acquired septic meningitis in adults: from emergency department to intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To study the clinical features, diagnostic processes, timing  of antibiotic administration and outcomes of patients with severe community-acquired septic meningitis at an emergency department (ED), who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. METHODS: From January 1993 to December 2005, the medical records of patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired septic meningitis were reviewed. The clinical characteristics, including causative pathogens, treatment course, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included, with an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 77.5%. The most common pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=20, 50%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=6, 15%), and Cryptococcus neoformans (n=5, 12.5%). There was a mean duration of 8.9 hours between ED arrival and initiation of antibiotic therapy. Effective antibiotics were administered for a mean period of 23.8 hours after arrival. Time delay from ED arrival to ICU admission was correlated with time delay of effective antibiotics administration, head computed tomography, and cerebrospinal fluid study (r=0.32, 0.47, and 0.53, respectively; p=0.05, 0.006, and 0.001, respectively). Earlier ICU admission was demonstrated in survivors as compared with those who died (11.1 vs. 38.0 hours, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Severe septic meningitis remains a disease with high mortality and morbidity. Expeditious diagnostic processes with early appropriate antibiotic treatment and ICU admission at the ED are important in improving the quality of care and patient outcome.
TI  - In-vitro bioactivity of Venda medicinal plants used in the treatment of respiratory conditions.
AB  - Infectious diseases, especially those affecting the respiratory tract, represent  a critical problem to health. Crude methanol and water extracts of 10 Venda plants reported to be used ethnomedically in the treatment of respiratory conditions were assessed for their antimicrobial activity against standard strains and clinical isolates of Candida albicans, Haemophilis influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycobacterium smegmatis using the disc diffusion assay. Four of the 10 plants tested possessed antimicrobial activity, but no activity against K. pneumoniae was observed. Minimum inhibitory concentrations, as determined by the broth microdilution assay, showed three plants, Securidaca longepedunculata, Syzygium cordatum, and Tabernaemontana elegans, to possess MICs </= 1 mg/mL. Phytochemical screening, performed by separation on thin layer chromatography using a variety of mobile phases and visualization with spray reagents as well as UV light showed various classes of compounds in the active extracts. Some of these have been associated with antioxidant activity, as confirmed in this study. Moreover, these extracts showed toxicity in vitro to lymphocytes. Although three plant species with significant antimicrobial activity were identified, there is a need for further scientific evaluation regarding identification of the bioactive constituents, as well as their toxicity.
TI  - 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying common uropathogens: a metabolic approach to the urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To address the shortcomings of urine culture for the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), we used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for identifying and quantifying Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia and Proteus mirabilis. PATIENTS, SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Urine samples from patients with suspected UTI (617), healthy volunteers (50) and commercially available standard strains of E. coli, K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Acinobacter, Pr. mirabilis, Citrobacter frundii, Streptococcus saprophyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were assessed between 2003 and 2006. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrophotometer; to quantify the bacteria we estimated the areas under the spectral peaks of the specific metabolic product compared with the known concentration of trimethyl silyl propionic acid. All urine specimens were cultured in addition to an assessment by NMR spectroscopy. RESULTS: Preliminary urinary spectroscopy of the unprocessed samples showed peaks of nonspecific metabolites such as succinate, acetate, lactate and ethanol, indicating infected samples. Based on the results from processed samples, 93% (240/256) of E. coli, 92% (101/110) of K. pneumoniae, 93% (56/60) of P. aeruginosa and eight of 10 Pr. mirabilis could be diagnosed with NMR (numerator) and urine culture (denominator). The remaining samples were sterile and/or had a bacterial population of <10(3) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. The NMR method diagnosed bacterial densities of >10(3) CFU. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of the common uropathogens E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and Pr. mirabilis by NMR spectroscopy has a shorter reporting time and can be used to differentiate between infected, contaminated and sterile specimens.
TI  - Invasive pneumococcal disease in children aged <5 years admitted to 3 urban hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in the world. The introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in developing countries will be facilitated by a clearer understanding of the disease burden for bacterial causes of pneumonia and meningitis and the prevalent serotypes of S. pneumoniae. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, hospital-based surveillance for a 2-year period involving children aged 2-59 months at 3 urban hospitals in Ibadan, Nigeria, using standard microbiological methods with confirmation and further testing of isolates at the Medical Research Council Laboratories in The Gambia. RESULTS: There were 1210 cases overall: 481 (39.8%) were meningitis, 399 (33.0%) were pneumonia, and 330 (27.2%) were bacteremia clinical syndromes. There were 24 cases of definite meningitis, of which 9 were caused by S. pneumoniae, 11 by Haemophilus influenzae type b, and 4 by Klebsiella species. Of the 90 culture-positive pneumonia cases, 9 were caused by S. pneumoniae, 2 by H. influenzae type b, and 79 by other species. Among cases of bacteremia, the pathogen isolation rate was 28.8% (95 of 330); the isolated species included S. pneumoniae (3 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (20 isolates), Klebsiella species (13 isolates), Salmonella species (15 isolates), and Escherichia coli (6 isolates). Of the 23 S. pneumoniae isolates, 11 were serotyped; the serotypes found were 5 (5 isolates), 19F (3 isolates), and 4 (3 isolates), and 1 isolate was nontypeable. These isolates were all susceptible to penicillin. Eight of 9 patients with definite pneumococcal meningitis died, whereas all patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and septicemia survived. CONCLUSIONS: Of the pneumococcal serotypes identified, 55% were covered by the licensed 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, whereas all are covered by the 10- and 13-valent vaccines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of five herbal extracts against multi drug resistant (MDR) strains of bacteria and fungus of clinical origin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of the crude ethanolic extracts of five plants were screened against multidrug resistant (MDR) strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. ATCC strains of Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus bovis, Pseudimonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans were also tested. The strains that showed resistance against the maximum number of antibiotics tested were selected for an antibacterial assay. The MDR strains were sensitive to the antimicrobial activity of Acacia nilotica, Syzygium aromaticum and Cinnamum zeylanicum, whereas they exhibited strong resistance to the extracts of Terminalia arjuna and Eucalyptus globulus. Community-acquired infections showed higher sensitivity than the nosocomial infections against these extracts. The most potent antimicrobial plant was A. nilotica (MIC range 9.75-313 microg/ml), whereas other crude plant extracts studied in this report were found to exhibit higher MIC values than A. nilotica against community acquired as well as nosocomial infection. This study concludes that A. nilotica, C. zeylanicum and S. aromaticum can be used against multidrug resistant microbes causing nosocomial and community acquired infections.
TI  - Regioselective synthetic approaches towards 1,2,8,9-tetraazadispiro[4.1.4.2]trideca-2,9-dien-6-ones of potential antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Reaction of 2,5-bis(arylmethylidene)cyclopentanones 1a-d with nitrilimines (generated in situ via triethylamine dehydrohalogenation of the corresponding hydrazonoyl chlorides 2a,b) in 1:2 molar ratio proceeds in a high regioselective manner affording monocycloadducts 3 and dicycloadducts in the form of two isomers 4, 5. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies of the isolated crystalline form of 3c support the established structure and indicate that the formed product is 7E, 4S, 5R. Antimicrobial activity screening of the synthesized compounds 3-5, utilizing a variety of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus fecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae), gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris) and yeast (Candida albicans), exhibited that all the prepared analogues acquire promising activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria especially compounds 3b, 4a (antimicrobial active agents against gram-positive bacteria) and 3c (antimicrobial active agent against gram-negative bacteria).
TI  - Role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - Eighty per cent of the cases of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) have an infective aetiology, atypical bacteria including Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounting for 5-10 % of these. However, the importance of association of M. pneumoniae with episodes of AECOPD still remains doubtful. The present study was therefore undertaken to delineate the extent of involvement of M. pneumoniae in patients with AECOPD at a referral hospital in Delhi, India. Sputum samples and throat swabs from a total of 100 AECOPD patients attending the Clinical Research Center of Vallabhbhai Patel Chest Institute, Delhi, were collected during a 2-year period (January 2004-June 2006). The samples were investigated for the presence of aerobic bacterial pathogens and M. pneumoniae. Diagnosis of infection with M. pneumoniae was based on culture, serology, direct detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen and PCR. Bacterial aetiology could be established in 16 of the 100 samples studied. Pseudomonas spp. were recovered from eight cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae from four and Klebsiella spp. from two cases. Acinetobacter sp. and Moraxella catarrhalis were isolated from one case each. Serological evidence of M. pneumoniae infection and/or detection of M. pneumoniae specific antigen were seen in 16 % of the cases. One case with definite evidence of M. pneumoniae infection also had coinfection with Pseudomonas spp. However, no direct evidence of M. pneumoniae infection was found in our study population as defined by culture isolation or PCR. In conclusion, although the serological prevalence of M. pneumoniae infection in our study population was significantly higher than in the control group, there was no direct evidence of it playing a role in AECOPD.
TI  - Neopyrrolomycins with broad spectrum antibacterial activity.
AB  - Three new antibiotics, neopyrrolomycins B (1), C (2), and D (3), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens were discovered. They exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from the ethyl acetate extracts of a Streptomyces sp. after purification by column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using X-ray crystallography (1) and NMR spectroscopy (2 and 3).
TI  - Tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  - Tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. In vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). Nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Brucella melitensis isolates. Combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. Moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against K. pneumoniae. Data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against Enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against K. pneumoniae bacteraemia and P. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. Antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. Thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
TI  - Antimicrobial property of a herbal preparation containing Dalbergia sissoo and Datura tramonium with cow urine against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - In this study, a herbal preparation containing Dalbergia sissoo and Datura stramoium with cow urine (DSDS), was evaluated for its antibacterial potential against pathogenic strains of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was compared to standard antibiotic drugs i.e. Chloramphenicol (30 mcg), Ampicillin (10 mcg), Nalidixic acid (10 mcg) and Rifampicin (30 mcg). Cow urine extract was found to be most active against both gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. Clinical isolate of S. aureus showed higher sensitivity towards cow urine extract of DSDS than standard strains, and inhibited growth on most regulatory levels such as inhibition of protein, DNA, RNA and peptidoglycan synthesis. The results of the present study shows that the cow urine extract of DSDS may be used as a potent antiseptic preparation for prevention and treatment of chronic bacterial infections.
TI  - Pathogens associated with sepsis in newborns and young infants in developing countries.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of pathogens causing infections in young infants (up to 90 days of life) is essential for devising community-based management strategies. Most etiological data from developing countries are hospital-based and may have little relevance to communities in which most babies are born at home. METHODS: We searched the literature for studies from developing countries reporting etiology of community-acquired infections (sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis) published since 1980. Hospital-based studies reporting early onset sepsis, sepsis among babies admitted from, or born at home were included. RESULTS: Of 63 studies, 13 focused on community-acquired infections, but limited data were available from home-born neonates. In the first week of life (3209 isolates), Klebsiella species (25%), Escherichia coli (15%), and Staphylococcus aureus (18%) were major pathogens. Group B streptococci (GBS) were relatively uncommon (7%), although regional differences existed. After the first week of life (835 isolates), S. aureus (14%), GBS (12%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and nontyphoidal Salmonella species (13%) were most frequent. S. pneumoniae (27%) was most common in the postneonatal period (among 141 isolates). Gram-negatives predominated (77%) among home-delivered babies (among 170 isolates). CONCLUSIONS: Limited information is available on etiology of serious bacterial infections in community settings. Hospital-based studies suggest that most infections in the first week of life are due to Gram-negative pathogens, and many may be environmentally rather than maternally-acquired, owing to unhygienic delivery practices. Such practices may also explain the predominance of Gram-negative infections among home-born infants, although data from home settings are limited. These findings have implications for developing prevention and management strategies in communities and hospitals.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Comparative analysis of the pathogens responsible for hospital acquired and community acquired late onset neonatal septicemia].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Late onset neonatal septicemia (systemic infection after 72 hours of life) remains a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early treatment with appropriate antibiotics is critical since infected infants can deteriorate rapidly. The aim of this study was to review the pathogens responsible for late onset neonatal septicemia (LONS) and their antimicrobial susceptibilities in order to guide the initial selection of appropriate antibiotics for infants with suspected LONS. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all cases with LONS seen in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005 was conducted. All cases were selected based on the clinical presentation and at least one positive result of blood culture. The basic clinical characteristics and the results of blood culture and antimicrobial susceptibilities were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 102 cases with LONS were identified. Among those 102 cases, 80 were community acquired (infants admitted from home and the blood culture was done on admission) and 22 were hospital acquired (infants became sick while in the NICU and the blood culture was done prior to use of antibiotics). The clinical presentations were non-specific. Compared to the infants with community acquired LONS, infants with hospital acquired LONS were usually born more prematurely (mean gestational age 33 +/- 3 vs 39 +/- 2 wks, t = 2.255, P < 0.01), with lower weight (mean weight 1.79 +/- 0.70 vs 3.23 +/- 0.67 kg, t = 8.818, P < 0.01) and with younger age (mean age 12 +/- 6 vs 16 +/- 7 days, t = 7.581, P < 0.05). Of the 102 cases, a total of 103 strains of bacteria were isolated. Among the pathogenic bacteria isolated, the most common were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (50/103, 48.5%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (16/103, 15.5%). The main pathogens for community acquired LONS were Staphylococcus species and Escherichia coli. The most important pathogen responsible for hospital acquired LONS was Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most (> 80%) of the Staphylococcus especially CoNS were resistant to common antibiotics such as penicillin, erythromycin and cefazolin. Significant numbers (6/9) of Staphylococcus aureus isolated were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, all of the Staphyloccus isolates were sensitive to vancomycin. Almost all (15/16) of the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated were multi-drug resistant due to production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). They were sensitive only to a few antibiotics such as carbapenems, aminoglycosides and quinolones. There was also one strain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Furthermore, there was no a single case of late onset neonatal sepsis due to infection with group B Streptococcus (GBS). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of late onset neonatal sepsis are usually non-specific. GBS is not a significant pathogen responsible for community acquired LONS in the Wenzhou area. There are increasing numbers of multi-drug resistant bacterial species isolated from the newborn infants with late onset neonatal septicemia, which is most likely due the non-restricted use of antibiotics in the hospitals as well as in the communities. A routine blood culture should be taken from any newborn infant who is suspected of LONS and empirical use of appropriate antibiotics should be initiated as soon as the blood specimen for culture has been drawn. To reduce the occurrence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, the use of antibiotics especially the third generation cephalosporins in neonates should be restricted as much as possible.
TI  - A fatty acid messenger is responsible for inducing dispersion in microbial biofilms.
AB  - It is well established that in nature, bacteria are found primarily as residents  of surface-associated communities called biofilms. These structures form in a sequential process initiated by attachment of cells to a surface, followed by the formation of matrix-enmeshed microcolonies, and culminating in dispersion of the bacteria from the mature biofilm. In the present study, we have demonstrated that, during growth, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an organic compound we have identified as cis-2-decenoic acid, which is capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms and of inhibiting biofilm development. When added exogenously to P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms at a native concentration of 2.5 nM, cis-2-decenoic acid was shown to induce the dispersion of biofilm microcolonies. This molecule was also shown to induce dispersion of biofilms, formed by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the yeast Candida albicans. Active at nanomolar concentrations, cis-2-decenoic acid appears to be functionally and structurally related to the class of short-chain fatty acid signaling molecules such as diffusible signal factor, which act as cell-to-cell communication molecules in bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract of school children in Buea, Cameroon.
AB  - The study was aimed at determining bacterial agents of the upper respiratory tract and the susceptibility patterns of isolates to antibiotics. In total, 200 throat swabs were obtained from students attending different boarding schools within the Buea Municipality and screened to obtain the prevalence of respiratory pathogens and to understand the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of isolates using standard microbiological procedure and the disc-diffusion test. Of the 200 samples screened, 112 (56%) had positive cultures with the dominant bacterial pathogens being Haemophilus influenzae (20%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (15%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). Although 56% of the isolates were recovered from females compared to 44% from males, the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05). Sixty-seven percent of the pathogens were isolated from the age-group of 10-13 years, 19.6% from the age-group of 14-17 years, and 12.5% from the age-group of 18-21 years. Antibiotic susceptibility testing revealed that gentamicin (92%) and cefuroxime (88.4%) were the most effective antibiotics against the isolates. Generally, susceptibility ranged from 0% to 92% depending on the antibiotic and the species of microorganism. Penicillin had the highest (100%) resistance to all the isolates. The findings revealed that students living in boarding schools in the Buea Municipality were at risk of acquiring upper respiratory tract infections from their peers since the upper respiratory tract of more than 50% of the students was colonized with respiratory pathogens. Although multidrug-resistant strains of organisms were identified, gentamicin and cefuroxime are recommended as the first-line antibiotics of choice against the pathogens. There is, therefore, a need for surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage of resistant strains of these organisms, especially H. influenzae in unhealthy school children since the vaccine is yet to be introduced in Cameroon. The findings have clinical and epidemiological significance.
TI  - Capsule polysaccharide is a bacterial decoy for antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (APs) are important host weapons against infections. Nearly all APs are cationic and their microbicidal action is initiated through interactions with the anionic bacterial surface. It is known that pathogens have developed countermeasures to resist these agents by reducing the negative charge of membranes, by active efflux and by proteolytic degradation. Here we uncover a new strategy of resistance based on the neutralization of the bactericidal activity of APs by anionic bacterial capsule polysaccharide (CPS). Purified CPSs from Klebsiella pneumoniae K2, Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased the resistance to polymyxin B of an unencapsulated K. pneumoniae mutant. Furthermore, these CPSs increased the MICs of polymyxin B and human neutrophil alpha-defensin 1 (HNP-1) for unencapsulated K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa PAO1. Polymyxin B or HNP-1 released CPS from capsulated K. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae serotype 3 and P. aeruginosa overexpressing CPS. Moreover, this material also reduced the bactericidal activity of APs. We postulate that APs may trigger in vivo the release of CPS, which in turn will protect bacteria against APs. We found that anionic CPSs, but not cationic or uncharged ones, blocked the bactericidal activity of APs by binding them, thereby reducing the amount of peptides reaching the bacterial surface. Supporting this, polycations inhibited such interaction and the bactericidal activity was restored. We postulate that trapping of APs by anionic CPSs is an additional selective virulence trait of these molecules, which could be considered as bacterial decoys for APs.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefditoren against major community-acquired respiratory pathogens recently isolated in Italy.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren--a broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin--and other comparator agents against 2,396 fresh isolates from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, collected from 6 clinical Italian microbiology laboratories. On penicillin-susceptible pneumococci and Streptococcus pyogenes, cefditoren demonstrated to be the most active antibiotic (MIC(90)values of 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L respectively), showing only a slight decrease in potency on penicillin-intermediate and resistant pneumococci (MIC(90)value 0.5 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L respectively). All the other comparators displayed MIC(90 )values of 4 - 8 mg/L for penicillins and of 4 to >64 mg/L for the oral cephalosporins. Cefditoren and levofloxacin were the most active against MSSA (MIC(90)0.5 mg/mL). Cefditoren displayed a uniformly potent inhibitory activity (MIC(90)of 0.03 mg/L) against all strains of Haemophilus influenzae, regardless of their ampicillin resistance (mediated or not by beta-lactamase production), while against Moraxella catarrhalis MIC(90)values were higher against beta-lactamase-positive (0.25 mg/L). Cefditoren was active also against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli : in this case its activity was comparable with that of levofloxacin. In conclusion, cefditoren, due to its potent activity, is a new effective therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2005)].
AB  - From October 2005 to September 2006, we collected the specimen from 366 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 411 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in infection, 406 strains were examined. The isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae 85, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 46, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 21, and Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 40. Of 70 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 38 (54.3%) and 32 (45.7%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of 37 strains (97.4%) at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Against MRSA, arbekacin and vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and in particular, panipenem inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Faropenem also had a preferable activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: over 128 microg/ml) for erythromycin (38.1%) and clindamycin (22.6%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 0.063 microg/ml or less. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and its MIC90 was 0.5 microg/ml. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), arbekacin had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 8 microg/ml. Against K. pneumoniae, cefozopran was the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/ml or less. Also, all the antibacterial agents except ampicillin generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 2 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (53.6%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 44.3% and 29.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (15.4%), S. pneumoniae (23.4%), and H. influenzae (21.3%). S. aureus (25.4%) and S. pneumoniae (18.0%) also were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.0%) and H. influenzae (21.4%). The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and their isolation frequencies were each 35.3%.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology and outcome in children with severe pneumonia in Uganda.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the 'under-5s' and in Uganda accounts for 10-30% of childhood deaths. Antibiotic resistance is increasing. OBJECTIVE: To describe the bacterial aetiology, antimicrobial sensitivity and outcome of severe pneumonia among children aged 2-59 months admitted to the Acute Care Unit, Mulago Hospital, Uganda. METHODS: A total of 157 children aged 2-59 months with symptoms of severe pneumonia according to WHO guidelines were recruited over a 4-month period in 2005/2006. Blood and induced sputum were obtained for culture, and chest radiographs were undertaken. Children were clinically classified as having severe or very severe pneumonia and were followed up for a maximum of 7 days. RESULTS: Bacteraemia was detected in 15.9% of patients with Staphylococcus aureus (36%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (28%) were the organisms most commonly isolated. Bacteria were isolated from sputum in half of the children, the commonest organisms being Streptococcus pneumoniae (45.9%), Haemophilus influenzae (23.5%) and Klebsiella species (22.4%). Staphylococcus aureus had only 33.3% sensitivity to chloramphenicol and H. influenzae isolates were completely resistant. S. pneumoniae was sensitive to chloramphenicol in 87.4% of cases. The case fatality rate was 15.5%. Independent predictors of death were very severe pneumonia (OR 12.9, CI 2.5-65.8), hypoxaemia (SaO(2) <92%, OR 4.9, CI 1.2-19.5) and severe malnutrition (OR 16.5, CI 4.2-65.5). CONCLUSION: S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are common bacterial causes of severe pneumonia. Chloramphenicol, the current first-line antibiotic for treating severe pneumonia in Ugandan children, is useful in pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae but other common bacteria show resistance. The presence of severe malnutrition, hypoxaemia and very severe pneumonia increase the risk of death and should be considered in case management protocols.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - Multicenter study to assess the in vitro activity of tigecycline by disk diffusion test against clinical isolates from Argentina.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a new antibiotic currently used in healthcare environments where multidrug resistance is prominent. Because there is a constant potential for resistance to emerge, survey studies are needed. METHODS: Isolates collected in 20 clinical laboratories from 4 states of Argentina between November 2005 and October 2006 were tested using the disk diffusion method as described by the CLSI. RESULTS: A total of 3,182 isolates were assessed. Gram-positive cocci represented 43.4% of the total isolates [Staphylococcus aureus (878), coagulase-negative staphylococci (255), Enterococcus spp. (201), Streptococcus spp. (47)], Enterobacteriaceae 39.6% and Acinetobacter spp. 11.1%. Tigecycline proved equally active against methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, as well as against vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (100% of susceptibility for all Gram-positive bacteria tested). Tigecycline susceptibility for Enterobacteriaceae, other than Proteeae tribe and Serratia spp., ranged from 88 to 100%, including against strains with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins with phenotype of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Escherichia coli 17.7% and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae 50.5%). Adopting a resistant breakpoint of 16 mm, 92% of the Acinetobacter isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. CONCLUSION(S): Tigecycline was active against a wide variety of bacterial species, including most of the multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, it could be a suitable option in the treatment of infections caused by these organisms in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (HROs) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to Dutch guidelines--were included. Epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. RESULTS: From 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique HRO isolates, as follows: Escherichia coli, 96 isolates; Klebsiella species, 11 isolates; Enterobacter species, 8 isolates; Proteus species, 9 isolates; Citrobacter species, 5 isolates; Pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; Acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; Morganella species, 2 isolates; Salmonella species, 1 isolate; Serratia species, 1 isolate; S. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and S. aureus, 9 isolates. No vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was found. The incidence density was 4.3 HRO isolates per 10,000 patient-days. The majority of HRO isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). A stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an HRO. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial transmission of HROs was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. The intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of HROs. This study shows that nosocomial transmission of HROs is largely preventable using transmission precautions.
TI  - A survey on species and prevalence rate of bacterial agents isolated from cockroaches in three hospitals.
AB  - The presence of cockroaches has health implications, such as nosocomial infection, as the insects move freely from areas within and around hospitals that may harbor pathogenic organisms. The goals of the present study were to determine species of bacteria isolated from cockroaches found in three Tehran hospitals, and to determine distribution of potential vectors by species and sex. The study is descriptive laboratory research. A total of 305 cockroaches from three species were trapped and identified: Periplaneta americana (65.6%), Blatella germanica (12.1%), and Blatta orientalis (22.3%). From these potential vectors, 19 species of bacteria were isolated and identified. After transportation of cockroaches to the laboratory, separation of the whole-homogenized suspension of each species was carried out. Identification of the isolated bacteria was performed according to Burgey's Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, 9th Edition. The most common species of bacteria isolated from cockroaches were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus Group D, Bacillus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus vulgaris. No statistical significance was found between sex and species of cockroach carrying bacteria (p > 0.05), but significance was found for sex in Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus non-group A&B (p < 0.05).
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution and drug resistance of the isolated bacteria from children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Dalian. METHODS: Between January 2006 and February 2007, 930 children with ARI were enrolled, including 364 with acute upper respiratory infection (AURI), and 566 with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). The AURI children, who did not receive antimicrobial agent treatment or received oral antimicrobial agents 1-2 times, had bacterial cultures of pharyngeal swab. The ALRI children, who received intravenous antibacterial agents more than 3 days, had bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Isolated bacteria were identified by the ATB system (Bio-Merieux, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out by means of Kirby-bauer. RESULTS: A total of 404 isolates (43.4%) were identified. Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22.5%, 12.1% and 7.4% respectively. In the isolates from AURI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 43.9%, 22.0% and 9.1% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Nonfermenters accounted for 4.5%, 8.3% and 3.0% respectively. In the isolates from ALRI, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 12.1%, 7.4% and 6.6% respectively; Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Nonfermenters accounted for 16.9%, 13.2% and 21.8% respectively. The resistant rates of Haemophilus to ampicillin and TMP-SMZ were 29.3% and 32.9% respectively, and to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefalotin, cefaclor, cefuroxime and cefotaxime were 12.1%, 10.0%, 10.0%, 11.4% and 5.7%, respectively. The resistant rate of Haemophilus to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefaclor, tetracycine and TMP-SMZ in the ALRI group were significantly higher than that in the AURI group (P<0.05 or 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Dalian, Haemophilus was the main isolate of children with ARI. The distribution of bacteria was different between ALRI and AURI. In ALRI, Gram-negative bacilli were in a higher proportion, and the resistant rates of Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefaclor were higher.
TI  - Childhood bacterial meningitis in Ibadan, Nigeria--antibiotic sensitivity pattern of pathogens, prognostic indices and outcome.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of morbidity, mortality and neurodisability in childhood, particularly in the developing world where effective vaccines against the usual pathogens responsible for the disease are not in routine use. To describe the patterns and outcome of bacterial meningitis among children admitted into the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, Nigeria. All children who satisfied the case definition for meningitis, admitted into the paediatric wards of the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan over a period of 30 months were prospectively enrolled and blood and CSF samples were taken for bacteriological analyses. A total of 97 children, 62 males and 35 females were studied. Their ages ranged between 2 months and 12 years, mean age 33.0 (SD=41.7) months, with 80.4% of the cases below the age of 5 years. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was the leading pathogen, found in 16 (55.1%) of the 29 cases of definite meningitis. Other isolates include Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.1%), Klebsiella spp (7.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (7.0%), Escherichia coli (3.4%) and Pseudomonas spp. (3.4%). Hib and pneumococcus showed varying degrees of resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and cotrimoxazole. Twenty six (26.8%) of the cases died and 67.6% of the survivors developed significant neurological sequele. Bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of childhood mortality and neurodisability. Hib and pneumococcus remain the major pathogens responsible for this dreadful disease in Ibadan, Nigeria. The increasing emergence of antibiotic resistance calls for institution of adequate control measures, particularly routine childhood immunisation against the disease.
TI  - Different application volumes of ethyl-cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive can change its antibacterial effects against ocular pathogens in vitro.
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the antibacterial effects in vitro of ethyl-cyanoacrylate (EC) tissue adhesive in different application volumes. METHODS: Volumes of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 25, and 35 mu l of EC were applied onto the surface of monolayer cultures of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC25924), Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC49619), Escherichia coli (ATCC25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC27853), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC13883). The diameter of each EC drop was measured, and the area of the circle of EC (formed after its application onto the monolayer culture) was calculated. The area of the antibacterial inhibitory halo surrounding the drop of EC on the monolayer culture was calculated. The ratio between the area of the EC and of the corresponding inhibitory halo was obtained for each EC volume and for each of the 5 types of bacteria studied. RESULTS: EC volume-dependent inhibitory halos were seen in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, but not in Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: The in vitro antibacterial effect of EC against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli varies in a dose-dependent fashion with its volume. No effect was observed against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and occurrence of tetracycline resistance determinants in isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against baseline pathogens isolated from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials for community-acquired pneumonia conducted in 29 countries worldwide. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.06 mg/L), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC(90) 1 mg/L). Twelve isolates of S. pneumoniae expressing tet(M) and two isolates of K. pneumoniae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases isolated during the study were susceptible to tigecycline. The excellent in vitro activity of tigecycline against these clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility against pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [The analysis of the bacterial and fungal flora in maxillary sinuses in patients  operated due to FESS method].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this work was to analyse the bacterial and fungal flora  in maxillary sinuses in patients operated due to the FESS method. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies were conducted on 110 patients, including 47 women aged 17-78 and 63 men aged 17-66, who underwent endoscopic surgical procedures due to chronic polypoid maxillary sinusitis between 2006 and 2007. 214 cultures were prepared altogether. During the endoscopic operation on paranasal sinuses, a cannula was introduced along the natural entrance and material for the culture and antibiogram was removed by suction. RESULTS: In the studied material of 214 cultures, 72 (33.6%) cultures obtained positive results, including 2 cases with bacterial and fungal floras present simultaneously (Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger) in 38 operated patients. In 25 (34.5%) cultures we noted the presence of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which was sensitive to the following antibiotics: Cotrimoxazole, Rifampicin, Vankomycin, Teicoplanin and Levofloxacin. Staphylococcus epidermidis was isolated in 22 (31.0%) cultures, showing 100% sensitivity to similar antibiotics like the previous one. Another bacteria (Escherichia coli) was cultured in 10 cultures (13.8%), in 70% of the cases every second bacteria was Staphylococcus epidermidis with 100% sensitivity mainly to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. In 3 cultures (4.17%) we found Klebsiella pneumoniae, with 100% sensitivity to cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 100% resistance to penicillins. In three cases Pseudomonas fluorescens and Proteus mirabilis (4.17% each) were cultured with their sensitivity and resistance similar to those of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two cases (2.8% each) in the cultures were noted: Citrobacter freundii, Streptococcus oralis and Hafnia alvei, which were 100% sensitive to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides whereas their resistance to penicillins and Cefuroxime was as high as 100%. CONCLUSION: In the operated patients suffering from chronic polypoid maxillary sinuses we found 33.6% of positive results in the bacterial flora. This indicates that the changes were accompanied by an acute inflammatory condition, thus surgical procedures had to be followed by a guided antibiotic. The cultured bacteria demonstrated sensitivity to some cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and resistance to penicillins, which proves the abuse of penicillins in the treatment of acute inflammatory states of upper airways.
TI  - Susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates from hospitalised patients with respiratory tract infections (MOXIAKTIV Study).
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine: (i) the prevalence of resistance in current clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae; (ii) the prevalence of production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and methicillin resistance in S. aureus; and (iii) regional differences in the prevalence of ESBL production and clonality of K. pneumoniae isolates. Pathogens causing respiratory tract infections in hospitalised patients were prospectively collected from all over Germany. Drugs tested by Etest included moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, clarithromycin and penicillin G. ESBL production by K. pneumoniae was determined using cefotaxime/ceftazidime +/- clavulanic acid. Deutsches Institut fur Normung (German Institute for Standardisation)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (DIN/EUCAST) breakpoints were used where applicable. Overall, 1859 pathogens were analysed. For all species tested the fluoroquinolones achieved the highest overall susceptibility rate (92.8%) compared with clarithromycin (60.5%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (85.7%) and cefuroxime (89.6%). From 438 K. pneumoniae isolates, 13.0% produced an ESBL. The ESBL prevalence was 38.8% in Eastern Germany with a trend towards clonality in some centres, but ranged from 4.7% to 7.1% in Southern, Northern and Western Germany. Among the methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates, 10.1% were moxifloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 99.3% were moxifloxacin- and levofloxacin-susceptible, 93.9% were penicillin G-susceptible and 85.7% were clarithromycin-susceptible. With a MIC90 value (minimal inhibitory concentration for 90% of the isolates) of 0.19 mg/L, moxifloxacin was more potent than levofloxacin (MIC90 = 1 mg/L) against S. pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae and M. catarrhalis were almost 100% susceptible to the quinolones; 100% of the M. catarrhalis but only 4.5% of the H. influenzae strains were clarithromycin-susceptible. Moxifloxacin was the most active agent amongst the drugs tested, in particular against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Protective activity of secreted proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae].
AB  - Protective efficacy of secreted proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae cultivated on cardiocerebral broth and semisynthetic growth medium respectively was studied in vivo. Fraction with molecular weight 30 - 50 kDa obtained by the method of membrane fractionation had high protective efficacy. Two-dose immunization of mice with this fraction provided 80 - 100% protection from infection by homologous strains of S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae. Cross-protective activity of the fraction was revealed when infecting immunized mice by different K-types of K. pneumoniae. Blood sera of mice immunized with 30 - 50 kDa fraction possessed preventive features protecting from infection 90% of animals while 100% of death in the control group. It was determined that protective efficacy of the mentioned fraction was determined by protein-containing antigens because proteolytic disruption of the protein component resulted in loss of protective properties of the preparation.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: A tertiary referral centre in Lagos, Nigeria. SUBJECTS: Twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. Eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral centre. INTERVENTION: Adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. RESULTS: Two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. Sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001). Infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, Streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, Staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (Porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, Peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, Prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, Clostridium perfringens 3.2%). Mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. The anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. Over 92% of the streptococci were sensitive to the beta-Lactams contrast low susceptibility with S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.
TI  - Sitafloxacin hydrate for bacterial infections.
AB  - Sitafloxacin hydrate (DU-6859a, Gracevit), a new-generation, broad-spectrum oral  fluoroquinolone that is very active against many Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic clinical isolates, including strains resistant to other fluoroquinolones, was recently approved in Japan for the treatment of respiratory and urinary tract infections. Sitafloxacin is active against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci with reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin and other quinolones and enterococci. Sitafloxacin has also demonstrated activity against clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (including about 67% of strains producing extended-spectrum, beta-lactamases and resistant to ciprofloxacin), Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa with some activity against quinolone-resistant strains and Acinetobacter baumannii. The in vitro activity against anaerobes is comparable to imipenem or metronidazole. In a published phase II randomized, open-label, multicenter study of patients hospitalized with pneumonia, sitafloxacin (400 mg once daily) was comparable to imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg three times a day). Results of the phase III trials of sitafloxacin are not available in English. The clinical safety profile of sitafloxacin has been characterized from 1,059 patients who participated in 10 clinical trials. The most common events with 50 or 100 mg twice daily were gastrointestinal disorders (17.2%), mostly diarrhea, and abnormal laboratory test results (16.2%), mostly liver enzyme elevations. For Japanese patients, sitafloxacin provides the broad-spectrum coverage promised by clinafloxacin and trovafloxacin and comparable to carbapenems. While it is currently limited by its potential for phototoxicity in Caucasians, phototoxicity is essentially irrelevant if sitafloxacin is used in hospitals and especially in intensive care units.
TI  - XLA-associated neutropenia treatment: a case report and review of the literature.
AB  - X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a primary B-cell deficiency syndrome with an incidence of 5 to 10 cases per million. The current treatment approach includes intravenous immunoglobulin and aggressive antibiotic regimens for infections. Besides recurrent infections, XLA patients may present with other manifestations, such as alopecia, enteropathy, amyloidosis, and neutropenia. Neutropenia, which has been shown in up to 25% of affected patients, might also contribute to the degree of severity of bacterial infections that have been reported in these cases. Here we present our experience with the granulocyte colony-stimulant factor, filgrastim (Neupogen), in the treatment of neutropenia in a 14-month-old child with XLA.
TI  - Empiric treatment with once-daily cefonicid and gentamicin for febrile non-neutropenic pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters.
AB  - SUMMARY: The approach to treating febrile non-neutropenic hematooncologic patients with central venous catheters varies. We recently introduced once-daily administration of cefonicid and gentamicin for such children who were in good clinical condition and without focal signs of infection. Our 2-year experience of 125 episodes in 54 children is hereby reported. Absolute neutrophil counts were 550 to 16,700/mm. Bacteremia occurred in 6.4% episodes: only in patients with Hickman/Broviac catheters and not in those with port-a-caths [8/37 (21.6%) vs. 0/17 patients, P=0.046; 8/86 (9.3%) vs. 0/39 episodes, P=0.056]. The pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (3), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (1), and Streptococcus milleri (1). All patients remained in stable clinical condition and all, except for 2 who became neutropenic and 1 with S. aureus bacteremia who developed cellulitis, defervesced while on the empiric therapy. Three episodes could not be managed as outpatients. No adverse effects were observed. We conclude that our approach is efficacious and safe and, furthermore, that empiric antibiotic therapy may not be indicated for selected patients with port-a-caths. Future study of children with Hickman/Broviac catheters will evaluate the use of cefonicid alone.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of mycotic aneurysms in a medical center in southern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mycotic aneurysm poses a high risk of mortality. This study evaluated the demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients with mycotic aneurysm. METHODS: Patients with mycotic aneurysm hospitalized between March 1996 and May 2006 at a medical center in southern Taiwan were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty two patients (38 men and 14 women; mean age, 64.5 +/- 15.6 years) were included. The leading underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus (40.4%), hypertension (21.2%), and renal disease and heart disease (19.2% each). The most common pathogens isolated from blood and/or resected tissue were Salmonella spp. (34.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11.5%). Mycotic aneurysms caused by Gram-negative bacilli were significantly more likely to occur in older patients (p=0.018) and at infrarenal sites (p=0.021). There were trends suggesting that mycotic aneurysms were more likely to be caused by Gram-negative bacilli in patients receiving steroid treatment and in those with underlying diabetes mellitus. Mycotic aneurysms caused by Gram-positive cocci were significantly more likely to occur in suprarenal arteries (p=0.048), especially intracranially (p=0.002), in younger patients (p=0.018) and in patients with concurrent endocarditis (p=0.008). The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 30.6%, and there was no significant difference in in-hospital mortality between mycotic aneurysms caused by Gram-negative bacilli and those due to Gram-positive cocci. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the anatomic site of mycotic aneurysm and the spectrum of culprit bacteria may help clinicians promptly choose appropriate antibiotic regimens on an empirical basis. Further study is required to understand better the role of K. pneumoniae in mycotic aneurysm in Taiwan.
TI  - Effect of electrical current on the activities of antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are resistant to conventional antimicrobial agents. Prior in vitro studies have shown that electrical current (EC) enhances the activities of aminoglycosides, quinolones, and oxytetracycline against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus gordonii. This phenomenon, known as the bioelectric effect, has been only partially defined. The purpose of this work was to study the in vitro bioelectric effect on the activities of 11 antimicrobial agents representing a variety of different classes against P. aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and S. epidermidis. An eight-channel current generator/controller and eight chambers delivering a continuous flow of fresh medium with or without antimicrobial agents and/or EC to biofilm-coated coupons were used. No significant decreases in the numbers of log(10) CFU/cm(2) were seen after exposure to antimicrobial agents alone, with the exception of a 4.57-log-unit reduction for S. epidermidis and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. We detected a statistically significant bioelectric effect when vancomycin plus 2,000 microamperes EC were used against MRSA biofilms (P = 0.04) and when daptomycin and erythromycin were used in combination with 200 or 2,000 microamperes EC against S. epidermidis biofilms (P = 0.02 and 0.0004, respectively). The results of these experiments indicate that the enhancement of the activity of antimicrobial agents against biofilm organisms by EC is not a generalizable phenomenon across microorganisms and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - The first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens conducted by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy. Part 1: a general view of antibacterial susceptibility.
AB  - The Japanese Society of Chemotherapy (JSC) conducted the first nationwide surveillance of bacterial respiratory pathogens during the period from January to August 2006. With the cooperation of 32 medical institutions throughout Japan, a total of 924 strains belonging to seven clinically relevant bacterial species were collected from adult patients with well-diagnosed respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the 887 evaluable strains (205 Staphylococcus aureus, 200 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 Streptococcus pyogenes, 165 Haemophilus influenzae, 91 Moraxella catarrhalis, 74 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 143 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) to 42 antibacterial agents was conducted at the Central Laboratory of the Research Center for Anti-infective Drugs of the Kitasato Institute, according to recommendations issued by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The antibacterial agents employed were 25 beta-lactams, three aminoglycosides, four macrolides (including one azalide and one ketolide), one lincosamide, one tetracycline, two glycopeptides, five fluoroquinolones, and one oxazolidinone. The incidence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) was 63.4%, and the incidences of penicillin-intermediately resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP) and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were 35.0% and 4.0%, respectively. Among H. influenzae, 21.2% of the strains were found to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin (ABPC)-intermediately resistant (BLNAI), 29.1% to be beta-lactamase-nonproducing ABPC-resistant (BLNAR), and 4.8% to be beta-lactamaseproducing ABPC-resistant (BLPAR) strains. The incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae was 2.7% (2 of 74 strains). Three (2.1%) of the 143 P. aeruginosa strains were found to be metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing, including 1 (0.7%) multidrug-resistant strain. Through the nationwide surveillance, we obtained fundamental antimicrobial susceptibility data of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens in adult RTI to various antibacterial agents. These data will be a useful reference for future periodic surveillance studies, as well as for investigations to control antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Effects of a low concentration hypochlorous Acid nasal irrigation solution on bacteria, fungi, and virus.
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Saline irrigation would be more effective for chronic sinusitis patients if it had bactericidal effects. Low concentrations of hypochlorous acid may be used as a nasal irrigation solution. First, we developed a 0.85% NaCl solution by adding NaCl to tap water (pH 7.0 and 8.4) and measuring the concentration of free chlorine and hypochlorous acid after giving the solution a short electrical impulse of 20 seconds. Then we investigated whether the derived hypochlorous acid had a toxic effect on human primary nasal epithelial cells, if and what effect it had on the expression of mucin genes, and, finally, if it had bactericidal, fungicidal, or virucidal effects. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biochemical experiment. METHODS: We treated human primary nasal epithelial cells with 3.5 ppm of hypochlorous acid and then examined the cells for cytotoxicity. We also investigated the bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal effects by challenging the cells with the following microorganisms Aspergillus fumigatus, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. To study the virucidal effects of HOCl, we used the human influenza A virus to challenge the cells. RESULTS: : In the cytotoxicity assay and in the morphological examination, the cells did not show anytoxicity at 30 minute or 2 hours after treatment with HOCl. More than 99% of bactericidal or fungicidal activity was noted for all species, except for Candida albicans, in tap water at either pH 7.0 or 8.4. In addition, a 3.2-log10 reduction was achieved in cells challenged with the human influenza A virus. CONCLUSIONS: A low concentration HOCl solution can be used as an effective nasal irrigation solution.
TI  - In vivo pharmacodynamics of ceftobiprole against multiple bacterial pathogens in  murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is the parenteral prodrug of ceftobiprole, a novel pyrrolidinone broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in vitro and in vivo bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). We have used murine thigh and lung infection models in neutropenic and normal mice to characterize the in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) activities of ceftobiprole against multiple strains of S. aureus (including MRSA), S. pneumoniae (including PRSP), and gram-negative bacilli. Serum levels of ceftobiprole following the administration of multiple doses were determined by a microbiological assay. In vivo bactericidal activities and postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of ceftobiprole against MRSA and PRSP strains were determined from serial CFU/thigh values following single doses of ceftobiprole (40 and 160 mg/kg of body weight). Dose fractionation studies were used to determine which PK-PD index correlated best with activity. Magnitudes of the PK-PD indices were calculated from MICs and PK parameters. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a static and 2-log(10) kill effects over 24 h. PK results showed area under the concentration-time curve/dose values of 1.8 to 2.8 and half-lives of 0.29 to 0.51 h. MICs ranged from 0.015 to 2 microg/ml. Ceftobiprole demonstrated time-dependent killing; its in vivo PAEs varied from 3.8 h to 4.8 h for MRSA and from 0 to 0.8 h for PRSP. The time above MIC (T > MIC) correlated best with efficacy for both MRSA and PRSP. The T > MIC values required for the static doses were significantly longer (P < 0.001) for Enterobacteriaceae (36 to 45%) than for S. aureus (14 to 28%) and S. pneumoniae (15 to 22%). The drug showed activities in the lung model similar to those in the thigh model. The presence of neutrophils significantly enhanced the activity of ceftobiprole against S. pneumoniae but only slightly against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Based on its PD profile, ceftobiprole is a promising new beta-lactam agent with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms including MRSA and PRSP.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic target attainment analysis of cefozopran in Japanese adult patients.
AB  - This study aimed to perform a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analysis to create a dosing strategy for cefozopran in Japanese adult patients. A total of 145 plasma concentration samples from 32 adult patients were used for a population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to assess the probability of attaining the PK-PD target (70% of the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration for the bacterium). The final population pharmacokinetic model was based on a two-compartment model, and creatinine clearance (Cl(cr)) and body weight (BW) were the most significant covariates: Cl(l/h) = 0.0263 x Cl(cr) + 1.49, V (c)(l) = 0.185 x BW(0.931), Q(l/h) = 4.55, V (p)(l) = 5.86, where Cl is the clearance, V (c) is the volume of distribution of the central compartment, Q is the intercompartmental clearance, and V (p) is the volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that 1 g q 12 h achieved a PK-PD target attainment probability of > or =85% against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. However, against Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 g q 8 h and (2 g, 1 g, 1 g) q 8 h were required to achieve a high probability, which value varied with the Cl(cr) and BW of the patient. These results provide a PK-PD-based strategy for tailoring cefozopran regimens in Japanese adult patients.
TI  - Survey of childhood empyema in Asia: implications for detecting the unmeasured burden of culture-negative bacterial disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parapneumonic empyema continues to be a disease of significant morbidity and mortality among children despite recent advances in medical management. To date, only a limited number of studies have assessed the burden of empyema in Asia. METHODS: We surveyed medical records of four representative large pediatric hospitals in China, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam using ICD-10 diagnostic codes to identify children <16 years of age hospitalized with empyema or pleural effusion from 1995 to 2005. We also accessed microbiology records of cultured empyema and pleural effusion specimens to describe the trends in the epidemiology and microbiology of empyema. RESULTS: During the study period, we identified 1,379 children diagnosed with empyema or pleural effusion (China, n = 461; Korea, n = 134; Taiwan, n = 119; Vietnam, n = 665). Diagnoses of pleural effusion (n = 1,074) were 3.5 times more common than of empyema (n = 305), although the relative proportions of empyema and pleural effusion noted in hospital records varied widely between the four sites, most likely because of marked differences in coding practices. Although pleural effusions were reported more often than empyema, children with empyema were more likely to have a cultured pathogen. In addition, we found that median age and gender distribution of children with these conditions were similar across the four countries. Among 1,379 empyema and pleural effusion specimens, 401 (29%) were culture positive. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 126) was the most common organism isolated, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 37) and Klebsiella (n = 35) and Acinetobacter species (n = 34). CONCLUSION: The age and gender distribution of empyema and pleural effusion in children in these countries are similar to the US and Western Europe. S. pneumoniae was the second leading bacterial cause of empyema and pleural effusion among Asian children. The high proportion of culture-negative specimens among patients with pleural effusion or empyema suggests that culture may not be a sufficiently sensitive diagnostic method to determine etiology in the majority of cases. Future prospective studies in different countries would benefit from standardized case definitions and coding practices for empyema. In addition, more sensitive diagnostic methods would improve detection of pathogens and could result in better prevention, treatment and outcomes of this severe disease.
TI  - Susceptibilities of common bacterial isolates from oman to old and new antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the antimicrobial activity of linezolid and tigecycline with other commonly used antibiotics against a variety of clinical isolates at Royal Hospital, Muscat. METHODS: Clinically-significant bacterial isolates in Royal hospital during the period from 1st of March to 30th of June 2007 were collected, stored and finally tested to determine their susceptibility to different antibiotics by broth microdilution (microscan panels). RESULTS: Two hundred ten bacterial strains were collected and tested including Staphylococcus aureus (29), Group B ss-haemolytic Streptococcus (10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Enterococcus spp. (16), Haemophilus spp. (15), Escherichia coli (26), Klebsiella spp. (26), Enterobacter spp. (25), Serratia spp. (10), Acinetobacter baumannii (17) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21). All strains except P. aeuginosa were susceptible to tigecycline. All gram-positive strains were susceptible to linezolid. Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed good activity against most organisms tested including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Levofloxacin showed 100% activity against K. pneumoniae and 61% activity against E. coli. The activity of 3rd generation cephalosporins against E.coli and K.pneumoniae ranged from 76% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline and linezolid showed excellent activity against microorganisms in their relevant spectrum of activity. However, they should be used wisely and judiciously.
TI  - A novel transposon, Tn6009, composed of a Tn916 element linked with a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize a novel conjugative transposon Tn6009 composed of a Tn916 linked to a Staphylococcus aureus mer operon in representative Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria isolated in Nigeria and Portugal. METHODS: Eighty-three Gram-positive and 34 Gram-negative bacteria were screened for the presence of the Tn6009 using DNA-DNA hybridization, PCR, hybridization of PCR products, sequencing and mating experiments by established procedures. RESULTS: Forty-three oral and 23 urine Gram-negative and Gram-positive isolates carried the Tn6009. Sequencing was performed to verify the direct linkage between the mer resistance genes and the tet(M) gene. A Nigerian Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from a urinary tract infection patient, and one commensal isolate from each of the other Tn6009-positive genera, Serratia liquefaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Enterococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. isolated from the oral and urine samples of healthy Portuguese children, were able to act as donors and conjugally transfer the Tn6009 to the Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2 recipient, resulting in tetracycline- and mercury-resistant E. faecalis transconjugants. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports a novel non-composite conjugative transposon Tn6009 containing a Tn916 element linked to an S. aureus mer operon carrying genes coding for inorganic mercury resistance (merA), an organic mercury resistance (merB), a regulatory protein (merR) and a mercury transporter (merT). This transposon was identified in 66 isolates from two Gram-positive and three Gram-negative genera and is the first transposon in the Tn916 family to carry the Gram-positive mer genes directly linked to the tet(M) gene.
TI  - Risk of bacteremia in bleeding and nonbleeding gastric varices after endoscopic injection of cyanoacrylate.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIM: Bacteremia is common in cirrhosis with gastrointestinal bleeding, including variceal bleeding. Elective esophageal sclerotherapy and banding have been reported to cause bacteremia. The risk associated with therapeutic endoscopy in patients with gastric varices has not yet been reported. This study was conducted to compare the risk of bacteremia between patients with active gastric variceal bleeding and those with gastric varices that were not actively bleeding who underwent N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate injection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were categorized into three groups: group I, patients with bleeding gastric varices who underwent cyanoacrylate injection for hemostasis (n = 20); group II, patients who underwent elective cyanoacrylate injection for further obliteration of gastric varices (n = 18); and group III, patients with cirrhosis who underwent endoscopic surveillance for varices, and patients with gastric varices who presented for a follow-up endoscopy without a requirement for treatment (n = 17). Blood culture was obtained before and 5 minutes and 3 hours after endoscopy. Needle tips were also sent for culture. RESULTS: Before procedures, blood cultures were positive in 4 patients (20 %) from group I. The number of positive blood cultures in group I at 5 minutes and 3 hours after the procedure were 3 (15 %) and 2 (10 %) respectively. The identified organisms were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (1), Vibrio cholerae non-O1 (1). No patient from group II had a positive culture at any point of blood drawn. Only one in group III had a positive culture, for Streptococcus mitis at 5 minutes. No clinical evidence of infections occurred in any patient. Needle-tip cultures grew mainly organisms from the oral and gastrointestinal tracts. CONCLUSIONS: Elective cyanoacrylate injection for nonbleeding gastric varices is not associated with significant bacteremia or infection. For this reason, prophylactic antibiotics may not be needed in this patient group. By contrast, prophylactic antibiotics are strongly recommended for patients with bleeding gastric varices undergoing cyanoacrylate injection.
TI  - [In-vitro activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2006].
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of various antibiotics against clinical bacterial isolates recovered from patients with infectious diseases at the medical facilities in the Kanto region between March and September 2006 was evaluated. A total of 1030 clinical isolates were available for susceptibility tests: 420 aerobic Gram-positive organisms, 520 aerobic Gram-negative organisms, 30 anaerobic Gram-positive organisms and 60 anaerobic Gram-negative pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility data for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae isolates from pediatric and adult patients were analyzed separately. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), biapenem (BIPM), doripenem (DRPM), cefozopran (CZOP), cefepime (CFPM), and sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ) were used as test antibiotics. PAPM, IPM and DRPM exhibited excellent in vitro antibacterial activities against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, with all isolates exhibiting a MIC of < or =0.06 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, PAPM demonstrated the strongest antibacterial activity among the carbapenems with a MIC range of < or =0.06 to 0.12 microg/mL. Against Enterobacteriaceae, MEPM showed the strongest antibacterial activity, and PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. Against the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species, the MICs for the cephems were high, however, those for the carbepenems were low. Against H. influenzae, PAPM had comparable activity to IPM. With respect to anaerobes, each of the carbapenems tested demonstrated almost the same strong antibacterial activity. In conclusion, 13 years has passed since PAPM was launched in 1993, PAPM still maintains potent antibacterial activity and is considered an effective antimicrobial agent for various types of infectious diseases.
TI  - [Experience with bronchomunal used in the combined treatment of patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].
AB  - The paper presents the results of treatment in 30 patients aged 16-59 years who have bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, by using a bacterial vaccine (bronchomunal) containing antigens of opportunistic bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus piogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis. Immunotherapy with the vaccine had good and excellent effects in 73.33 of cases; the mean duration of acute respiratory viral infection decreased from 16 to 9 days after vaccination and a need for antibiotics. In the comparison group, a good effect was noted in 40% of the patients during one-year follow-up; the difference was statistically significant. The vaccine's tolerance was good; only 3 (9.9%) patients were observed to have vaccination-induced complications: exacerbations of chronic maxillary sinusitis and chronic bronchitis in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. The positive effect of bronchomunal was associated with the better values of cellular immunity, stabilized phagocytosis, and lower IgE levels.
TI  - Adrenal gland hemorrhage in patients with fatal bacterial infections.
AB  - A wide spectrum of adrenal gland pathology is seen during bacterial infections. Hemorrhage is particularly associated with meningococcemia, while abscesses have been described with several neonatal infections. We studied adrenal gland histopathology of 65 patients with bacterial infections documented in a variety of tissues by using immunohistochemistry. The infections diagnosed included Neisseria meningitidies, group A streptococcus, Rickettsia rickettsii, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Ehrlichia sp., Bacillus anthracis, Leptospira sp., Clostridium sp., Klebsiella sp., Legionella sp., Yersinia pestis, and Treponema pallidum. Bacteria were detected in the adrenal of 40 (61%) cases. Adrenal hemorrhage was present in 39 (60%) cases. Bacteria or bacterial antigens were observed in 31 (79%) of the cases with adrenal hemorrhage including 14 with N. meningitidis, four with R. rickettsii, four with S. pneumoniae, three with group A streptococcus, two with S. aureus, two with B. anthracis, one with T. pallidum, and one with Legionella sp. Bacterial antigens were observed in nine of 26 non-hemorrhagic adrenal glands that showed inflammatory foci (four cases), edema (two cases), congestion (two cases), or necrosis (one case). Hemorrhage is the most frequent adrenal gland pathology observed in fatal bacterial infections. Bacteria and bacterial antigens are frequently seen in adrenal glands with hemorrhage and may play a pathogenic role. Although N. meningitidis is the most frequent bacteria associated with adrenal gland pathology, a broad collection of bacteria can also cause adrenal lesions.
TI  - Etiologic agents and outcome determinants of community-acquired pneumonia in urban children: a hospital-based study.
AB  - Etiologic clues and prognostic indicators of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were sought in a 30-month study of under-5 admissions for acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). Investigative tools included blood culture, hemogram, immunofluorescence and serology. Associations of variables were tested using standard statistical tools. Of 419 ALRI, 323 (77%) had pneumonia, 234 (72.4%) bronchopneumonia, 66 (20.4%) lobar pneumonia and 23 (7.1%) both. More than 70% had poor parental socioeconomic parameters, 56.8% were overtly malnourished, 37.8% lived in overcrowded homes and 16.7% had been potentially exposed to wood smoke. Despite preconsultation antimicrobial use in 35.6%, 59 (28.8%) of 205 blood cultures proved positive; Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 22 (37.3%), Klebsiella species nine (15.3%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae three (5.1%). Ninety-two viruses were identified in 61 (50%) of 122 analyses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 28 (30.4%), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3) for 18 (19.5%) and influenza type-A (flu-A) 16 (17.3%). Twenty (16.4%) had > or = 2 viruses, while 40% of bacteremic cases with positive viral identification(s) had PIV-3. Pathogen detection was neither associated with hematologic parameters nor the final respiratory diagnosis. There were 35 (10.8%) deaths. Mortality was associated with maternal illiteracy (p = 0.045), wood smoke exposure (p = 0.006), preconsultation antimicrobial use (p = 0.04), malnutrition (p = 0.0003), bacteremia (p = 0.006) and polymorphonuclear leucocytosis (p = 0.023/0.013). RSV, PIV-3, flu-A, S. aureus and Klebsiella species constitute the major pathogens of pediatric CAP in urban Nigeria, while malnutrition, wood smoke exposure and bacteremia are strong risk factors of mortality. The poor prognostic import of antimicrobial abuse, vis-a-vis the apparent selection of necrotizing pathogens, are compelling indications for a reappraisal of current regional antimicrobial policies and exploring newer frontiers of disease control, including vaccine prevention.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on extracts of four species of stachys.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the methanol extracts of the dried flowering aerial parts of Stachys byzantina, S. inflata, S. lavandulifolia and S. laxa (Labiatae) were studied using the disc diffusion method and determination of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Aspergilus niger and Candida albicans. The extracts of plants exhibited concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against the bacteria tested. The extracts were more active against Gram-positive microorganisms. The extracts, however, did not show any antifungal activity.
TI  - A 30-month experience of thoracic empyema in a tertiary hospital: emphasis on differing bacteriology and outcome between the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and medical ward.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the causative pathogens and outcomes of patients with thoracic empyema admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and medical ward. METHODS: We prospectively studied the empyemic patients in the MICU and retrospectively analyzed the medical records of empyemic patients in the medical ward treated in a tertiary university hospital from April 2001 to September 2003. RESULTS: During this period, 116 patients in the medical ward and 78 patients in MICU had complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyemas. Effusion cultures were positive in 164 patients (85%); a total of 147 and 78 microorganisms were isolated from the 106 medical ward patients and 58 MICU patients, respectively. No matter whether medical ward or MICU patients, aerobic gram-negative organisms were the most common bacteria in positive-culture effusions (110, 67%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (14, 24%) was the predominant pathogen among the MICU patients, and Streptococcus spp. (28, 26%) was the main pathogen among the medical ward patients. Compared with these positive-culture empyemic patients in the medical ward, MICU patients had a significantly higher percentage of aerobic gram-negative organism infections (P = 0.034) and a higher infection-related mortality rate (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The mortality and predominant pathogens in patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions or thoracic empyemas in the medical ward and MICU were different. The increasing gram-negative pathogens in empyemas have become an urgent problem.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of Abrus precatorius (L) fabaceae extract on  some clinical pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activities of the extracts  of Abrus precatorius on some clinical isolates as resistance to available and affordable antibiotics by these pathogens is on the increase. METHOD: In this study the antimicrobial effects of the extracts of Abrus precatorius from leaves, stem and the seed oil were tested against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, three clinical S. aureus isolates from different sources, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus (S.milleri), Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium spp (toxigenic strain of the mitis biotype), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as Candida albicans using the agar well diffusion technique. Aqueous and methanolic extraction, using the soxhlet extractor was carried out on all plant parts used while petroleum ether was the solvent used to extract the seed oil. To measure the MIC values, various concentrations of the stock, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 and 4 microg/ml were assayed against the test bacteria. RESULT: At the different concentrations of the extracts used (512 microg/ml - 4 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive organism with an MIC of 8 ug/ml for the leaf extract. Extract from the stem and seed oil were potent against some of the gram-positive bacteria and Candida albicans but not against S anginosus, E. faecalis and gram-negative bacteria tested. The pH of the extracts ranged between pH5 and pH8. This study demonstrates that Abrus precatorius particularly the seed oil has a potent antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: The results substantiate the ethno botanical use of different parts of Abrus precatorius for the treatment of various bacteria-related diseases. Topical application of Abrus precatorius extracts in ointments may be recommended especially for treating superficial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - [Psoas abscess in Cote d'Ivoire: a report of eighteen cases].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoas abscess is a rarely encountered entity with a non specific clinical presentation resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. No published data exist on this disease in our country. OBJECTIVE: To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic features of psoas abscesses in Cote d'Ivoire. Methodes: A retrospective study of 18 psoas abscesses seen over seven years in two teaching hospitals. RESULTS: There were 10 women and eight men with a mean age of 35.7 years (range:16-62 years). The abscess was primary in 15 cases, secondary in three, right sided in 15 and left sided in three cases. Fever, abdominal pain, difficulties in walk, abdominal mass and psoitis were the main clinical signs. Ultrasonography allowed the diagnosis of psoas abscess in 14 cases and in the remaining 4 cases the diagnosis was done peroperatively. The germs were identified in 12 patients and were: Escherichia coli in 3 cases, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases each and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in one case. Patients were given antibiotics together with surgical drainage of the abscess (n=16) or percutaneous needle aspiration (n=2). Postoperative complications included parietal suppurations (n=5) and intraperitoneal abscesses (n=2). No death occurred. CONCLUSION: For psoas abscess in our practice, ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic tool and surgical drainage remains an effective therapeutic method.
TI  - Non-gonococcal bacterial agents of conjunctivitis and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns in Ilorin, Nigeria.
AB  - Periodic bacteriological surveillance of purulent ocular discharge is a necessity. To determine the prevalent bacterial agents of purulent conjunctivitis and their antibiotic susceptibility patterns at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Ilorin, Nigeria. All bacterial isolates obtained during routine processing of conjunctival swab specimens were studied at the Department of Microbiology UITH between January and December 2004. The isolates were obtained after inoculation of the specimens onto blood, chocolate and MacConkey agar plates, incubated at 37 degrees C for 18-24hours under aerobic conditions except for chocolate agar plates which were kept in candle extinction jar. The isolates were identified using a combination of colony morphology, biochemical and/or serological tests as applicable. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed using the modified Kirby Bauer method. One hundred and four conjunctival swabs from 104 patients were analysed and 72 were bacteriologically positive, giving prevalence rate of 69.2%. The positive samples were from 42 males and 30 females with M:F ratio of 1.4:1. The age range was from 5 hours of life to 80 years. Well over half (61.1%) of the swabs were from neonatal age group. The isolated organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 43.1%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 22.2%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3.9%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 11.1%, and Escherichia coli 9.7%. Most of the isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones while erythromycin has the least bacterial coverage. The most common bacterial agent of purulent conjunctivitis in Ilorin is Staphylococcus aureus and fluoroquinolones have the best coverage for common bacterial agents of purulent conjunctivitis.
TI  - The establishment of resistance phenotypes for bacteria isolated from outpatients in urine cultures.
AB  - From 1911 outpatients, who addressed a Timisoara private clinical laboratory, from January to December 2005, we collected 1,889 urine cultures, 431 being positive. Bacteria identification was generally done using morphological, cultural, biochemical characters and pathogenicity tests. Sensitivity testing to antimicrobial medical drugs was done by using the classical diffusion Kirby-Bauer method and the automatic analyzer Osiris, also. The main bacteria involved in the etiology of these infections were represented by Enterobacteriaceae, head of the list being Escherichia coli (81.21%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.35%) and Proteus mirabilis (3.02%). We also isolated Gram positive cocci (in a much smaller proportion), mainly represented by Enterococcus faecalis (1.16%), Staphylococcus aureus (0.93%), Streptococcus agalactiae, and also Gram negative non-fermentative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.93%) or Acinetobacter baumanii (0.23%). As soon as we performed the sensitivity tests, we divided them in resistance phenotypes: Most of the Enterobacteriaceae were integrated in the wild phenotype, followed by the penicillinase producing phenotype. An E. coli strain (0.29%) and 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (8.33%) were integrated in the large spectrum, multidrug resistant, beta-lactamase producing phenotype, also associated with resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides; Non-fermentative bacilli did not present special resistance problems, the four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were integrated in the wild phenotype (secreting induced chromosomal cephalosporinase). As for Staphylococcus aureus it was identified a strain having fluoroquinolone resistance, two strains secreting penicillinase and having a K (Nm) phenotype and a strain secreting penicillinase only. Antibiotic resistance represents a major concern for patients, physicians, healthcare managers, and policymakers. The use of antibiotics is closely linked with the development of acquired antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - Assessing genetic heterogeneity within bacterial species isolated from gastrointestinal and environmental samples: how many isolates does it take?
AB  - Strain typing of bacterial isolates is increasingly used to identify sources of infection or product contamination and to elucidate routes of transmission of pathogens or spoilage organisms. Usually, the number of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species that is analyzed per sample is determined by convention, convenience, laboratory capacity, or financial resources. Statistical considerations and knowledge of the heterogeneity of bacterial populations in various sources can be used to determine the number of isolates per sample that is actually needed to address specific research questions. We present data for intestinal Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus uberis from gastrointestinal, fecal, or soil samples characterized by ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and PCR-based strain-typing methods. In contrast to previous studies, all calculations were performed with a single computer program, employing software that is freely available and with in-depth explanation of the choice and derivation of prior distributions. Also, some of the model assumptions were relaxed to allow analysis of the special case of two (groups of) strains that are observed with different probabilities. Sample size calculations, with a Bayesian method of inference, show that from 2 to 20 isolates per sample need to be characterized to detect all strains that are present in a sample with 95% certainty. Such high numbers of isolates per sample are rarely typed in real life due to financial or logistic constraints. This implies that investigators are not gaining maximal information on strain heterogeneity and that sources and transmission pathways may go undetected.
TI  - Frequency of isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from blood culture, Gondar University teaching hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial bloodstream infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, with up to one-quarter of affected patients dying as a result of their infection. Up-to-date information on blood culture isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern is very important as guide for immediate prescription of antimicrobial agents and monitoring of emergence of drug resistant strains. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of blood culture isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of isolates in Gondar University teaching hospital. METHODS: This was retrospective analysis of records of blood culture results for febrile patients seen at Gondar University teaching hospital, bacteriology section from March 2001 to April 2005. RESULTS: During the four years period, blood cultures were done for a total of 472 febrile patients. Among these, 233 (49.4%) were females and 239 (50.6%) were males. The median age was 20.5 years (age range of 2 hours to 78 years). Out of these, total of 114 bacterial strains were isolated with culture positivity rate of 24.2%. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) were isolated with the highest frequency in 38 (33.3%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus in 34 (29.8%), Salmonella species other than Salmonella typhi in 12 (10.5%), Klebsiella species in 10 (8.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (5.3%), Salmonella typhi in 4 (3.5%), Enterobacter species in 3 (2.6%), Escherichia coli in 2 (1.7%). The gram positive and gram negative bacteria constituted 80 (70.2%) and 34 (29.8%) of the culture isolates, respectively. Culture positivity rates vary as for neonates, 63% (17 out of 27);followed by 25.6% (36 out of 141) in children and 20% (61 out of 304) in adults. The isolates especially gram negative bacteria showed multiple drug resistance, to Ampicillin and penicillin. However, ciprofloxacin is fairly effective against both gram negative and gram positive isolates. CONCLUSION: An effective documented data may serve as a guide for initial empirical treatment of bloodstream infections but in view of these findings the presented data is only imperative to do large-scale prospective and quantitative studies. More importantly, an ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility is of the essence to enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - The antibacterial and antifungal properties of trappin-2 (pre-elafin) do not depend on its protease inhibitory function.
AB  - Trappin-2 (also known as pre-elafin) is an endogenous inhibitor of neutrophil serine proteases and is involved in the control of excess proteolysis, especially in inflammatory events, along with the structurally related secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor. Secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor has been shown to have antibacterial and antifungal properties, whereas recent data indicate that trappin-2 has antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the present study, we tested the antibacterial properties of trappin-2 towards other respiratory pathogens. We found that trappin-2, at concentrations of 5-20 microm, has significant activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis and the pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, in addition to P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. A similar antimicrobial activity was observed with trappin-2 A62D/M63L, a trappin-2 variant that has lost its antiprotease properties, indicating that trappin-2 exerts its antibacterial effects through mechanisms independent from its intrinsic antiprotease capacity. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antifungal activities of trappin-2 were sensitive to NaCl and heparin, demonstrating that its mechanism of action is most probably dependent on its cationic nature. This enables trappin-2 to interact with the membranes of target organisms and disrupt them, as shown by our scanning electron microscopy analyses. Thus, trappin-2 not only provides an antiprotease shield, but also may play an important role in the innate defense of the human lungs and mucosae against pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - [Analysis on variance of common pathogenic bacteria and drug resistance in children in Chengdu area from 2001 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variance and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from children with infectious diseases seen between 2001 and 2006 in Chengdu area. METHODS: A total of 2888 pathogenic bacterial strains isolated from children in Chengdu Children's Hospital from 2001 to 2006 were analyzed. Tests were performed according to the guidelines of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) of the United States. RESULT: (1) Of the 2888 strains, 1845 (63.9%) were Gram negative bacteria. The main pathogenic bacteria included Escherichia coli (Ec, 718 strain, 24.9%), Hemophilus (H, 476 strain, 16.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp, 412 strain, 14.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp, 369 strain, 12.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa, 353 strain, 12.2%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (Se, 278 strain, 9.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa, 146 strain, 5.1%) and other non-zymocyte (Onz, 136 strain, 4.7%). (2) The common pathogens found in blood specimen were 158 strain, which included Se (78 strain, 49.4%), Ec (23 strain, 14.6%), Kp (17 strain, 10.8%), Sa (14 strain, 8.9%), Onz (14 strain, 8.9%), Sp (7 strain, 4.4%) and Pa (5 strain, 3.2%). (3) The number of common pathogens isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infection was 2018, including Ec (441 strains, 21.9%), H (430 strains, 21.3%), Sp (368 strains, 18.2%), Kp (253 strains, 12.5%), Sa (207 strains, 10.3%), Se (149 strains, 7.3%), Pa (97 strains, 4.8%) and Onz (73 strains, 3.6%). (4) There were 120 strains of common pathogens isolated from urine specimens, including Ec (78 strains, 65%), Kp (25 strains, 20.8%), Onz (7 strains, 5.8%), Pa (5 strains, 4.2%) and Se (5 strains, 4.2%). (5) There were 497 strains of common pathogens found in pus specimens, including Ec 167 strains, (33.6%), Sa (126 strains, 25.4%), Se (46 strains, 9.3%), H (44 strains, 8.9%), Onz (37 stains, 7.4%), Kp (31 strains, 6.2%), Sp (26 strains, 5.2%) and Pa (20 strain, 4.0%). The trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 6.7% and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci (MRCNS) rate was 20% in 2001 - 2003. The total proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase stains (ESBL(S)) in Ec and Kp was 21.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae (Hi) was 19.4% in 2001 - 2003.The proportion of MRSA was 17.2% and the MRCNS rate was 70.2%, the total proportion of ESBL(S) in Ec and Kp was 43.8%, and the rate of beta-lactamase producing stains of Hi was 39.7% in 2004 - 2006. CONCLUSION: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria seen in Chengdu Children's Hospital has changed and the trend of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics deteriorated in recent three years. Regionally monitoring the changes in pathogenic bacteria and the trend of drug resistance to antibiotics is paramount in guiding the pediatric clinical treatment.
TI  - Comparative activity of meropenem in US medical centers (2007): initiating the 2nd decade of MYSTIC program surveillance.
AB  - Since 1997, the Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection (MYSTIC) Program has monitored the antimicrobial activity of broad-spectrum agents against pathogens from hospitalized patients. In the United States, 2894 isolates were submitted in 2007 from 15 sites, including 1392 Enterobacteriaceae, 643 nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli, and 829 Gram-positive cocci. All isolates were tested by broth microdilution methods. Meropenem (MIC(90) range, 0.12-2 microg/mL) exhibited the lowest resistance rates (1.9-2.4%) against Enterobacteriaceae, and fluoroquinolones had the highest rates of resistance (17.3-18.3%). KPC carbapenemases, usually found in Klebsiella pneumoniae, were also detected in Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., and Escherichia coli. Confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolate rates for E. coli, Klebsiella spp., and Proteus mirabilis isolates were 6.0%, 12.0%, and 0.0%, respectively. Meropenem remained active against Gram-positive pathogens such as staphylococci (methicillin-susceptible; MIC(90), 0.12-0.25 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), and beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90) range, 0.06-0.25 microg/mL). These US MYSTIC Program results demonstrate the continued emergence of novel beta-lactamases and multidrug-resistant bacterial phenotypes necessitating monitoring of carbapenem activities against Enterobacteriaceae species as well as nonfermentative bacilli.
TI  - [Postoperative penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumonia in lung cancer patient].
AB  - A 78-year-old man underwent a left lower sleeve lobectomy and lymph node dissection for lung cancer. His postoperative course had been uneventful until postoperative day (POD) 3, but severe dyspnea occurred suddenly and the chest X-p showed infiltration shadow on POD 3. Streptococcus pneumonia antigen in the urine was elevated, suggesting pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumonia. The patient was treated with double dose of imipenem/cilastatin sodium and supported with a mechanical ventilator in an intensive care unit. Although the patient recovered from penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumonia, he was suffered from Klebsiella sepsis and expired on the POD 26.
TI  - Review of neonatal infections in University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital: common bacterial pathogens seen.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections are important causes of morbidity in the neonatal period. Therefore identification of infecting organisms and the risk factors for possible bacterial infection in the newborn is of great importance. Institution early appropriate therapy is an important step in combating morbidity and mortality in this age group. METHODS: Medical records of patients admitted into the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) of the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) were reviewed over a 5-yaer period (1995-1999) RESULTS: Of the 1,304 newborn admissions over the study period, 813 (62.3%) had risk factors for neonatal infections. Staphyloccus aureus (46.2%) was the predominant organism isolated from blood culture, followed by Klebsiella spp (24.8%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas are the least encountered in this series. Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the predominant pathogens in pyogenic meningitis. Most of the delivery occurred outside the teaching hospital, even those that delivered in the hospital, some come in during labour. CONCLUSION: Neonatal bacterial infections are still a cause of high morbidity and mortality of the newborn in our setting. To reduce the morbidity and mortality from neonatal bacterial infections, mothers need to attend antenatal clinic, so that those who at risk can be taken care off immediately.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection from Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and the changes of drug resistance of  common pathogenic bacteria in children with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) of Chengdu. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected from children with LRTL who had been admitted to the Chengdu Children's Hospital between 2001 and 2006. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed after bacteria had been identified. The results between 2001 and 2003 were compared with those between 2004 and 2006. RESULTS: Hemophilus (24.3%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria for LRTI in children between 2001 and 2003, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18.8%), Escherichia coli (18.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.0%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.4%) and other non-zymocyte (4.4%). Escherichia coli (23.7%) was the most common pathogenic bacteria in children with LRTL between 2004 and 2006, followed by Hemophilus (19.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.0%) and other non-zymocyte (3.2%). Compared with the years of 2001-2003, the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics between 2004 and 2006 increased: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 18.0% vs 8.8%, Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci 70.5% vs 18.1%, Extended-spetrum beta-lactamase stains 44.4% vs 22.6%, and beta-lactamase production stains of Hemophilus influenzae 40.2% vs 20.1%. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of common pathogenic bacteria of children with LRTL has changed and the rate of drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria to antibiotics is increasing in recent three years in Chengdu.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in intensive care units in Canada: results of the Canadian National Intensive Care Unit (CAN-ICU) study, 2005-2006.
AB  - Between 1 September 2005 and 30 June 2006, 19 medical centers collected 4,180 isolates recovered from clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) in Canada. The 4,180 isolates were collected from 2,292 respiratory specimens (54.8%), 738 blood specimens (17.7%), 581 wound/tissue specimens (13.9%), and 569 urinary specimens (13.6%). The 10 most common organisms isolated from 79.5% of all clinical specimens were methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (16.4%), Escherichia coli (12.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (7.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci/Staphylococcus epidermidis (6.5%), Enterococcus spp. (6.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.8%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (4.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (3.9%). MRSA made up 22.3% (197/884) of all S. aureus isolates (90.9% of MRSA were health care-associated MRSA, and 9.1% were community-associated MRSA), while vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) made up 6.7% (11/255) of all enterococcal isolates (88.2% of VRE had the vanA genotype). Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae occurred in 3.5% (19/536) and 1.8% (4/224) of isolates, respectively. All 19 ESBL-producing E. coli isolates were PCR positive for CTX-M, with bla CTX-M-15 occurring in 74% (14/19) of isolates. For MRSA, no resistance against daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin was observed, while the resistance rates to other agents were as follows: clarithromycin, 89.9%; clindamycin, 76.1%; fluoroquinolones, 90.1 to 91.8%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 11.7%. For E. coli, no resistance to amikacin, meropenem, and tigecycline was observed, while resistance rates to other agents were as follows: cefazolin, 20.1%; cefepime, 0.7%; ceftriaxone, 3.7%; gentamicin, 3.0%; fluoroquinolones, 21.1%; piperacillin-tazobactam, 1.9%; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 24.8%. Resistance rates for P. aeruginosa were as follows: amikacin, 2.6%; cefepime, 10.2%; gentamicin, 15.2%; fluoroquinolones, 23.8 to 25.5%; meropenem, 13.6%; and piperacillin-tazobactam, 9.3%. A multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistance to three or more of the following drugs: cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, amikacin or gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin) occurred frequently in P. aeruginosa (12.6%) but uncommonly in E. coli (0.2%), E. cloacae (0.6%), or K. pneumoniae (0%). In conclusion, S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA), E. coli, P. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, Enterococcus spp., S. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in Canadian ICUs. A MDR phenotype is common for P. aeruginosa isolates in Canadian ICUs.
TI  - In vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, an anti-MRSA cephalosporin, against recent gram-positive and gram-negative isolates of European origin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for use as a contemporary baseline to help detect any changes in its activity profile throughout the course of clinical development and use. METHODS: MICs were determined by broth microdilution testing for ceftobiprole and comparators against 6680 isolates [1201 S. aureus, 460 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 526 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1213 Escherichia coli, 854 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 443 Proteus mirabilis, 406 Enterobacter cloacae, 387 Citrobacter spp., 291 Serratia marcescens, 621 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 278 Acinetobacter spp.] from 31 sites in 12 countries. RESULTS: Ceftobiprole activity against MRSA (MIC90 2 mg/L) was 4-fold less than the activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC90 0.5 mg/L) and a similar trend was observed for methicillin-resistant CoNS (MIC90 2 mg/L) and methicillin-susceptible CoNS (MIC90 0.25 mg/L). Activity against S. pneumoniae (MIC90s: penicillin-susceptible, 0.015 mg/L; -intermediate, 0.25 mg/L; -resistant, 0.5 mg/L) was comparable to that of ceftriaxone. Ceftobiprole activity against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 0.12 mg/L; non-susceptible, >32 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC90s: ceftazidime-susceptible, 8 mg/L, non-susceptible, >32 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90: >32 mg/L for imipenem-susceptible and non-susceptible) was comparable to that of cefepime. As with cefepime, ceftobiprole activity was decreased among cephalosporin-resistant isolates of gram-negative bacilli [extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or non-ESBL mediated]. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftobiprole demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA and showed activity against key gram-negative bacilli comparable to that of cefepime. Given this broad spectrum of activity, ceftobiprole appears well suited for development and use in the treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia in Port Harcourt Rivers State of Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major cause of death world wide. Knowledge of the likely pathogens and their sensitivity/resistance pattern can help in the choice of antibiotic therapy and improve outcome. OBJECTIVE: To identify the seasonal variation; age and sex distribution; bacteriology; antimicrobial sensitivity pattern of isolates; haematological data; radiology and clinicaloutcome of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients admitted to hospital in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, and Braithwaite Memorial Hospital, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. PATIENTS: Adults admitted to the hospitals with CAP between 1 May 2002, and 30 April 2003. INTERVENTIONS: A diagnostic strategy using regular collection of sputum samples for gram stain, bacteriological culture and chest radiography were done. Blood cultures were done in severe cases. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was done on the positive cultures. RESULTS: During a 12 month period, 54 patients aged 16 to 82 years (mean 38.1 years) were evaluated. A total of 944 medical admissions were seen during the same period. This gives a prevalence rate of 5.7%. Twenty six classes of bacteria were isolated from the sputum of 23 patients (yield, 42.6%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common pathogen, was isolated in nine cases (34.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae which was present in eight (30.8%). Other isolates included, Escherichia coli, four cases (15.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, three cases (11.5%), and Staphylococcus aureus, two cases (7.7%). The commonest radiological pattern was lobar consolidation (49.9%) with no Distinct pattern associated with any conventional bacterial pathogen. The isolates showed good sensitivity to the newer and more expensive antibiotics (quinolines and cephalosporines) with marked resistance to the older and cheaper ones. However, clinical responses to benzyl penicillin and gentamycin were found to be good. Out of 54 patients evaluated, four (7.4%) died. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella were common aetiological organisms of CAP in Port Harcourt. Treatment of CAP with benzyl penicillin remains an appropriate first line choice in this environment while the more expensive quinolines and cephalosporines can be used as backups.
TI  - [Epidemiology of bacterial intrahospital infections in newborns].
AB  - Nosocomial infections are important problem for the modern medicine. Especially sensitive category, susceptible to nosocomial infections, are the infants. The aim of the research was to establish an active monitoring over the breaking out of the nosocomial infections in the Neonatology Department of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Clinic of the University Clinical Center Tuzla (UKC) and to determine the kind of bacteria that causes the nosocomial infections as well as the type of infection according to anatomical localization. The research encompassed 8000 of newborn infants at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in the years 2005 and 2006. The determining of the nosocomial infections was done by using the standard CDC criteria. The results show that in two researching years the leading nosocomial infections were bacteriemia, followed by other infections, respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections. The mostly identified carrier of the nosocomial infections in 2005 were gram-positive bacteria (65,5%): coagulase-negative staphylococci was isolated in 54,6%, Staphylococcus aureus in 5,5% and Streptococcus species in 5,5% of cases (p<0,001). The isolated gram-negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2005 were Klebisiella pneumoniae (21,8%), Escherichia coli (5,5%), Pseudomanas aeruginosa (3,6%) and Morganella morganii (3,6%) (p<0,05). In 2006 the mostly identified and isolated carriers of nosocomial infections were gram positive bacteria (64,2%): coagulase-negative Staphylococci (43,3%), Streptococcus species (13,4%) and Staphylococcus aureus (7,5%) (p<0,001). Gram negative bacteria, carriers of nosocomial infections in 2006 were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19,4%), Escherichia coli (10,5%), Acinetobacter species (3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1,5%) and Proteus mirabilis (1,5%) (p<0,05). The bacteriemia was mostly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus. Infections of the urinary tract were caused by gram-negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Other infections were caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Infections of the respiratory tract were caused by Streptococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most frequent carriers of the nosocomial infections at the Neonatology Department of the UKC Tuzla in 2005 and 2006 was gram-positive bacteria-coagulase-negative Staphylococci.
TI  - Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia in adult patients in Asian countries: a prospective study by the Asian network for surveillance of resistant pathogens.
AB  - Appropriate antimicrobial treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) should  be based on the distribution of aetiological pathogens, antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens, clinical characteristics and outcomes. We performed a prospective observational study of 955 cases of adult CAP in 14 hospitals in eight Asian countries. Microbiological evaluation to determine etiological pathogens as well as clinical evaluation was performed. Bronchopulmonary disease (29.9%) was the most frequent underlying disease, followed by cardiovascular diseases (19.9%), malignancy (11.7%) and neurological disorder (8.2%). Streptococcus pneumoniae (29.2%) was the most common isolate, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.4%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.1%). Serological tests were positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (11.0%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (13.4%). Only 1.1% was positive for Legionella pneumophila by urinary antigen test. Of the pneumococcal isolates, 56.1% were resistant to erythromycin and 52.6% were not susceptible to penicillin. Seventeen percent of CAP had mixed infection, especially S. pneumoniae with C. pneumoniae. The overall mortality rate was 7.3%, and nursing home residence, mechanical ventilation, malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory rate>30/min and hyponatraemia were significant independent risk factors for mortality by multivariate analysis (P<0.05). The current data provide relevant information about pathogen distribution and antimicrobial resistance of major pathogens of CAP as well as clinical outcomes of illness in Asian countries.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot hybridization (mPCR/RLB) assay for detection of bacterial respiratory pathogens in children with pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a novel method for simultaneous identification of 12 potential bacterial pathogens in children with community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS: A multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot (mPCR/RLB) assay was developed, to identify 12 respiratory bacterial pathogens, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Bordetella pertussis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and single (uniplex) PCRs were used for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae only. In a preliminary evaluation, we compared the results of mPCR/RLB with those of single (uniplex) PCRs and culture of nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 100 children under 5 years, admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital between October 2004 and May 2005, with pneumonia. RESULTS: Reference strains and clinical isolates of all 12 target species were correctly identified by mPCR/RLB. Potential pathogens were isolated from one blood culture and 26% of respiratory cultures. One or more pathogens were identified in 70% of respiratory specimens--by mPCR/RLB in 63%, uPCR only in another 3%, culture only in 2%, and culture plus uPCR in 2%. The species most commonly identified were S. pneumoniae (54%) and H. influenzae (38%, including type b, 4%). Cultures were not performed for B. pertussis, M. tuberculosis, C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae but each was identified by mPCR/RLB in between one and four specimens. Two or more potential pathogens were identified in 35% of specimens. Ten of 14 S. pneumoniae isolates belonged to serotypes represented in the 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: The mPCR/RLB assay is a sensitive tool for identification of respiratory pathogens, including mixed infections and bacteria requiring special culture methods.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of tigecycline against aerobic and facultative isolates recovered from hospitalized patients: an Argentinean multicenter study.
AB  - Tigecycline, the 9-t-butylglycylamino derivative of minocycline is the first commercially available glycylcycline exhibiting an extended spectrum of antibacterial activity due to its capacity to evade the tetracycline ribosomal and efflux resistance mechanisms. We conducted a collaborative in vitro study determining the activity of tigecycline compared to 14 antimicrobials against clinically relevant isolates obtained from adult patients hospitalized in 9 Argentinean institutions. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. The number of isolates and MICs 50/90 (mg/L) for tigecycline were the following: Acinetobacter spp. 132 (0.5/1); Escherichia coli 220 (0.12/0.25); Klebsiella spp. 220 (0.5/1), Enterobacter spp. 205 (0.5/1); Serratia spp. 84 (0.5/2); Haemophilus influenzae 96 (0.25/0.5); Staphylococcus aureus 223 (0.12/0.25); Streptococcus pneumoniae 98 (<or= 0.25/1); S. agalactiae 51 (0.5/0.5); Enterococcus spp. 104 (0.06/0.12); Pseudomonas aeruginosa 169 (8/16). We conclude that tigecycline is a promising drug for the treatment of infections in hospitalized patients in Argentina.
TI  - Biological screening of some Turkish medicinal plant extracts for antimicrobial and toxicity activities.
AB  - Screening of antibacterial activity and toxicity of 22 aqueous plant extracts from 17 Turkish plants was conducted. Antibacterial activity was performed with six bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Extracts of Tussilago farfara leaves, Helichyrsum plicatum flowers, Solanum dulcamara aerial parts and Urtica dioica leaves gave the best inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Of the 22 plant extracts, 20 extracts displayed toxicity (LC50 was <1000 mg L(-1)) in the brine shrimp bioassay. For radish seed bioassay, two different determinations (root length and seed germination) were performed with a comparison between two concentrations (50,000 mg L(-1) and 10,000 mg L(-1)). At low concentration (10,000 mg L(-1)), S. dulcamara aerial parts and Primula vulgaris leaf extracts were observed to inhibit the root length more than the other plant extracts. Also, the most inhibitive plant extract for seed germination was obtained with S. dulcamara aerial parts.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials against multiresistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test the activity of tigecycline combined with 16 antimicrobials in vitro against 22 gram-positive and 55 gram-negative clinical isolates. METHODS: Antibiotic interactions were determined by chequerboard and time-kill methods. RESULTS: By chequerboard, of 891 organism-drug interactions tested, 97 (11%) were synergistic, 793 (89%) were indifferent and 1 (0.1%) was antagonistic. Among gram-positive pathogens, most synergisms occurred against Enterococcus spp. (7/11 isolates) with the tigecycline/rifampicin combination. No antagonism was detected. Among gram-negative organisms, synergism was observed mainly with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against Serratia marcescens (5/5 isolates), Proteus spp. (2/5) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2/5), with aztreonam against S. maltophilia (3/5), with cefepime and imipenem against Enterobacter cloacae (3/5), with ceftazidime against Morganella morganii (3/5), and with ceftriaxone against Klebsiella pneumoniae (3/5). The only case of antagonism occurred against one S. marcescens with the tigecycline/imipenem combination. Selected time-kill assays confirmed the bacteriostatic interactions observed by the chequerboard method. Moreover, they revealed a bactericidal synergism of tigecycline with piperacillin/tazobactam against one penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and with amikacin against Proteus vulgaris. CONCLUSIONS: Combinations of tigecycline with other antimicrobials produce primarily an indifferent response. Specific synergisms, especially against enterococci and problematic gram-negative isolates, might be worth investigating in in vitro models and/or in animal models simulating the human environment.
TI  - Picomolar inhibitors as transition-state probes of 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidases.
AB  - Transition states can be predicted from an enzyme's affinity to related transition-state analogues. 5'-Methylthioadenosine nucleosidases (MTANs) are involved in bacterial quorum sensing pathways and thus are targets for antibacterial drug design. The transition-state characteristics of six MTANs are compared by analyzing dissociation constants (K(d)) with a small array of representative transition-state analogues. These inhibitors mimic early or late dissociative transition states with K(d) values in the picomolar range. Our results indicate that the K(d) ratio for mimics of early and late transition states are useful in distinguishing between these states. By this criterion, the transition states of Neisseria meningitides and Helicobacter pylori MTANs are early dissociative, whereas Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae MTANs have late dissociative characters. This conclusion is confirmed independently by the characteristic [1'- (3)H] and [1'- (14)C] kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of these enzymes. Large [1'- (3)H] and unity [1'- (14)C] KIEs are observed for late dissociative transition states, whereas early dissociative states showed close-to-unity [1'- (3)H] and significant [1'- (14)C] KIEs. K d values of various MTANs for individual transition-state analogues provide tentative information about transition-state structures due to varying catalytic efficiencies of enzymes. Comparing K d ratios for mimics of early and late transition states removes limitations inherent to the enzyme and provides a better predictive tool in discriminating between possible transition-state structures.
TI  - Inherent antibacterial activity of a peptide-based beta-hairpin hydrogel.
AB  - Among several important considerations for implantation of a biomaterial, a main  concern is the introduction of infection. We have designed a hydrogel scaffold from the self-assembling peptide, MAX1, for tissue regeneration applications whose surface exhibits inherent antibacterial activity. In experiments where MAX1 gels are challenged with bacterial solutions ranging in concentrations from 2 x 10(3) colony forming units (CFUs)/dm2 to 2 x 10(9) CFUs/dm2, gel surfaces exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Results show that the hydrogel surface is active against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) bacteria, all prevalent in hospital settings. Live-dead assays employing laser scanning confocal microscopy show that bacteria are killed when they engage the surface. In addition, the surface of MAX1 hydrogels was shown to cause inner and outer membrane disruption in experiments that monitor the release of beta-galactosidase from the cytoplasm of lactose permease-deficient E. coli ML-35. These data suggest a mechanism of antibacterial action that involves membrane disruption that leads to cell death upon cellular contact with the gel surface. Although the hydrogel surface exhibits bactericidal activity, co-culture experiments indicate hydrogel surfaces show selective toxicity to bacterial versus mammalian cells. Additionally, gel surfaces are nonhemolytic toward human erythrocytes, which maintain healthy morphologies when in contact with the surface. These material attributes make MAX1 gels attractive candidates for use in tissue regeneration, even in nonsterile environments.
TI  - Effect of eucalyptus essential oil on respiratory bacteria and viruses.
AB  - The activity of Eucalyptus globulus essential oil was determined for 120 isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 40 isolates of S. agalactiae, 20 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, 40 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, 30 isolates of H. parainfluenzae, 10 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 isolates of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and two viruses, a strain of adenovirus and a strain of mumps virus, all obtained from clinical specimens of patients with respiratory tract infections. The cytotoxicity was evaluated on VERO cells by the MTT test. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration. H. influenzae, parainfluenzae, and S. maltophilia were the most susceptible, followed by S. pneumoniae. The antiviral activity, assessed by means of virus yield experiments titered by the end-point dilution method for adenovirus, and by plaque reduction assay for mumps virus, disclosed only a mild activity on mumps virus.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial evaluation of guanylsulfonamides.
AB  - A series of guanylsulfonamides, 2-amino-9-[2-substituted-4-(4-substituted piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenyl]-1,9-dihydropurin-6-ones, was synthesized by adopting reductive aminoformylation of 2-amino-5-nitro-6-[4-(piperidin-1-sulfonyl)phenylamino]-3H-pyrimidin- 4-one and subsequent intramolecular ring condensation as key steps. All the guanylsulfonamides were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis, and their antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans. Of the guanylsulfonamides, 13e and 13f displayed better antibacterial activities than that of Norfloxacin against the bacterial strains S. aureus and S. faecalis except 13f against S. faecalis, which exhibited the activity similar to that of Norfloxacin. Against the fungal strains A. flavus and A. niger, 13g and 13h showed similar activities to that of Griseoflavin-16 except 13h against A. niger, which displayed a profound drop in the activity compared to that of Griseoflavin-16. The remarkable inhibition of the growth of the bacterial and fungal strains makes these substances promising microbial agents.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of DC-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - DC-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. DC-159a showed activity against Streptococcus spp. (MIC(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Staphylococcus spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. Against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the MIC 90 of DC-159a was 8 microg/ml. DC-159a was the most active against Enterococcus spp. (MIC 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml) and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. The activity of DC-159a against Mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. The MICs of DC-159a against Chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and DC-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. The MIC 90s of DC-159a against Peptostreptococcus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. DC-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, DC-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. The bactericidal activity of DC-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. These activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with DC-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity, and quantitative structure-activity relationships of new (Z)-2-(nitroimidazolylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranone derivatives.
AB  - A new series of (Z)-2-(1-methyl-5-nitroimidazole-2-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (11a-p) and (Z)-2-(1-methyl-4-nitroimidazole-5-ylmethylene)-3(2H)-benzofuranones (12a-m) were synthesized and assayed for their antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Most of the 5-nitroimidazole analogues (11a-p) showed a remarkable inhibition of a wide spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, MRSA, and Bacillus subtilis) and Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas 4-nitroimidazole analogues (12a-m) were not effective against selected bacteria. The quantitative structure-activity relationship investigations were applied to find out the correlation between the experimentally evaluated activities with various parameters of the compounds studied. The QSAR models built in this work had reasonable predictive power and could be explained by the observed trends in activities.
TI  - Bacteriologic comparison of tonsil core in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although many bacteriology studies on tonsillar diseases have been completed, all have been confined to children and were characterized by a paucity of cases. The purpose of this study was to analyze the underlying bacterial pathogens in tonsillar disease. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 824 patients who underwent elective tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. We analyzed the differences between the bacterial pathogens in recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy with regard to age, season, and antibiotic sensitivity. RESULTS: Among 824 cases, 966 bacterial strains from the tonsil core were isolated. In recurrent tonsillitis, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen (30.3%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (15.5%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes, 14.4%). In patients over 14 years of age, quite differently from other age groups, Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated at a significantly higher percentage. In tonsillar hypertrophy, H. influenzae was isolated most commonly (31.4%) regardless of age, followed by S. pyogenes (24.2%), S. aureus (22.9%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.6%). Furthermore, mixed infection was common because of its high resistance to penicillin. In both groups, S. pneumoniae was more common in younger patients, whereas K. pneumoniae was relatively common in adults. We found no differences in the detection rate by season; however, H. influenzae was frequently isolated in the tonsillar hypertrophy group regardless of seasonal variations. We also found no difference in the antibiotic sensitivity between the two groups; however, strains resistant to penicillin were relatively prevalent and showed a high sensitivity to third-generation cephalosporin. CONCLUSIONS: We observed some differences in the types of bacteria in the tonsillar core between the recurrent tonsillitis and tonsillar hypertrophy groups. Our study indicates that essential bacteria have been changing and, thus, we need to change our choice of antibiotics.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis in Nepal.
AB  - This study was conducted at Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Nepal from January 2001 to March 2002. The prevalence of bacterial meningitis, its causative organisms and their antibiotic sensitivity patterns were studied in cerebrospinal fluid of 448 suspected cases. The prevalence of acute bacterial meningitis was 8.3%. There was no significant association (p > 0.05) of the disease with gender (X2 = 0.0234) and among different age groups (X2 = 6.07875) studied. The causative bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.2%), coagulase negative staphylococci (10.8%), Escherichia coli (10.8%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8.2%), Neisseria meningitidis (5.4%), Acinetobacter spp. (5.4%) and Aeromoanas spp. (2.7%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic, however, 11.1% of P. aeruginosa, 25.0% of E. coli and 50.0% of Acinetobacter spp. were resistant to the drug.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of 7-(substituted)-aminomethyl-4-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid derivatives.
AB  - Gram-positive organisms have re-emerged as the major hospital pathogens, which make the unmet medical needs for antibacterial therapy even worse. In searching for potent agents against Gram-positive pathogens, novel 7-(substituted)-aminomethyl-quinolone-3-carboxylic acids were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their antibacterial activities in vitro. Many 7-monoarylaminomethyl derivatives exhibited high potency against Gram-positive organisms compared to reference agents: vancomycin and pazufloxacin. Additionally, a few 7-monoalkylaminomethyl derivatives exhibited good activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Leptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is an important regulator of appetite and energy expenditure and is now appreciated for its ability to control innate and adaptive immune responses. We have reported previously that the leptin-deficient ob/ob mouse exhibited increased susceptibility to the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this report we assessed the impact of chronic leptin deficiency, using ob/ob mice, on pneumococcal pneumonia and examined whether restoring circulating leptin to physiological levels in vivo could improve host defences against this pathogen. We observed that ob/ob mice, compared with wild-type (WT) animals, exhibited enhanced lethality and reduced pulmonary bacterial clearance following Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge. These impairments in host defence in ob/ob mice were associated with elevated levels of lung tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, macrophage inflammatory peptide (MIP)-2 [correction added after online publication 28 September 2007: definition of MIP corrected], prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), lung neutrophil polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) counts, defective alveolar macrophage (AM) phagocytosis and PMN killing of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Exogenous leptin administration to ob/ob mice in vivo improved survival and greatly improved pulmonary bacterial clearance, reduced bacteraemia, reconstituted AM phagocytosis and PMN H(2)O(2) production and killing of S. pneumoniae in vitro. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that leptin improves pulmonary bacterial clearance and survival in ob/ob mice during pneumococcal pneumonia. Further investigations are warranted to determine whether there is a potential therapeutic role for this adipokine in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Crystal structure of cefditoren complexed with Streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2X: structural basis for its high antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Cefditoren is the active form of cefditoren pivoxil, an oral cephalosporin antibiotic used for the treatment of respiratory tract infections and otitis media caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Beta-lactam antibiotics, including cefditoren, target penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are membrane-associated enzymes that play essential roles in the peptidoglycan biosynthetic process. To envision the binding of cefditoren to PBPs, we determined the crystal structure of a trypsin-digested form of PBP 2X from S. pneumoniae strain R6 complexed with cefditoren. There are two PBP 2X molecules (designated molecules 1 and 2) per asymmetric unit. The structure reveals that the orientation of Trp374 in each molecule changes in a different way upon the formation of the complex, but each forms a hydrophobic pocket. The methylthiazole group of the C-3 side chain of cefditoren fits into this binding pocket, which consists of residues His394, Trp374, and Thr526 in molecule 1 and residues His394, Asp375, and Thr526 in molecule 2. The formation of the complex is also accompanied by an induced-fit conformational change of the enzyme in the pocket to which the C-7 side chain of cefditoren binds. These features likely play a role in the high level of activity of cefditoren against S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacteriological study of Indian cheese (paneer) sold in Chandigarh.
AB  - A study was conducted to isolate and identify bacterial pathogens/contaminants in paneer samples sold in Chandigarh. Fifty eight samples of paneer bought at random were cultured on several media. Bacterial colony counts were also done. The predominant organisms isolated were Staphylococcus species, aerobic spore bearers, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Acinetobacter species and Streptococcus species. The viable bacterial counts obtained ranged from 3 x 10(2) to 9.7 x 10(10) CFU/mL. Contamination of paneer by pathogenic bacteria could be an important factor of gastrointestinal illnesses in the consumers.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of tosufloxacin against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections].
AB  - We determined the susceptibility of bacteria which were isolated from the patients with respiratory infections between January and October 2005, to tosufloxacin and other fluoroquinolones. A total of 900 isolate including 300 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 100 Moraxella catarrhalis, 200 Haemophilus influenzae, 100 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin were used as the test antimicrobials. Tosufloxacin, gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were potent antibiotics tested for the antibacterial activity against Streptococcus including penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae; the MIC90 were 0.12-0.5/ micromL. Fluoroquinolones exerted the potent antibacterial activity against M. catarrhalis and H. influenzae; the MIC90 of fluoroquinolones tested were < or =0.06 microg/mL. Tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and prulifloxacin showed to be more active against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, but parts of some strains were resistant. These results indicate that tosufloxacin has the potent antibacterial activity against major organisms detected from patients with respiratory infections. Since it was approved in 1990, tosufloxacin was considered to be useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treatment of respiratory infections.
TI  - Preliminary phytochemical investigation and antibacterial activity of Phyllanthus amarus Schum & Thorn.
AB  - The aqueous extract of Phyllanthus amarus Schum & Thorn, was selected for preliminary phytochemical and antibacterial activity against human pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentration was performed by broth dilution method and the zone of inhibition was studied by agar disc diffusion method at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg/ml in DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide). The results revealed the antimicrobial activity of extract against the the strains of microorganisms concentrations in ranges of 60 and 500 mug/ml. Aqueous extract of leaves and roots of Phyllanthus amarus exhibited significant antibacterial activity against eight test bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris. The plant under study revealed the presence of alkaloids, phytosterols, phenolic compounds and tannins, proteins and amino acids , lignins and saponins.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens recovered from vegetables irrigated by wastewater in Morocco.
AB  - The authors obtained 50 vegetable samples from various regions in Morocco and examined them to determine the microbiological quality of these products. Aerobic count, coliform, enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. This analysis revealed high levels of enterococci, fecal coliforms, and total coliforms. No coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was detected in any of the samples analyzed. Biochemical identification of Enterobacteriaceae showed the presence of Citrobacter freundii (28 percent), Enterobacter cloacae (27 percent), Escherichia coli (16 percent), Enterobacter sakazakii (12 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17 percent), Serratia liquefaciens (11 percent), and Salmonella arizonae (0.7 percent). The results clearly demonstrate that vegetables irrigated with untreated wastewater have a high level of microbiological contamination. Consequently, these vegetables may be a threat for the Moroccan consumer and may be considered a serious risk to Moroccan public health.
TI  - Prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (PLT) components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one double-dose PLTs were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL). After split, each PLT unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 CFUs. One unit was photochemically treated (PCT; 150 micromol/L amotosalen and 3 J/cm(2) ultraviolet A). The other unit was untreated. All units were stored and sampled on Days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the BacT/ALERT system (bioMerieux). PLTs were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. RESULTS: In all PCT PLTs, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. In untreated PLTs, Staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. Growth of 1 to 10 CFUs per unit Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 CFUs per unit of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 to 1000 CFUs per unit Propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. Low levels of Streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 CFUs/unit), Escherichia coli (1-100 CFUs/unit), and Clostridium perfringens (1-100 CFUs/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: For the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated PLTs may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. In contrast, bacterial inactivation by PCT could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of PLTs contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.
TI  - [Drug-resistant bacteria isolated from pharyngeal swab cultures and urine in acutely or chronically febrile elderly nursing home inmates].
AB  - AIM: Patients in nursing homes are becoming more and more elderly and also prone  to infectious diseases. It is important to select proper antimicrobial agents in treating such patients because of the increase in drug-resistant bacteria in recent years. METHODS: Pathogenic aerobic bacteria were isolated from cultures of the pharyngeal swab obtained from patients with acute febrile episodes and those with chronic febrile conditions with a repetition of fever or continuing low-grade fever. Isolation of pathogens was also carried out in patients with a urinary tract infection that was resistant to treatment. Isolated bacteria were tested for sensitivity to commonly used antimicrobial agents. RESULTS: Pathogenic bacteria were isolated from 33% of the patients with acute febrile episodes, while they were isolated from 75% of the patients with chronic febrile conditions. The number of major pathogenic bacteria from 85 isolates were methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 6, Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, beta-hemolytic streptococcus 5, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10, and Enterobacter cloacae 6. Only two isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-sensitive (PSSP), while the others were penicillin-resistant (PRSP) (1) or penicillin-insensitive (PISP) (5). Among these 8 isolates, 5 were resistant to levofloxacin (LVFX). Escherichia coli was isolated from the pharyngeal swab of 2 patients, one of the 2 isolates being resistant to LVFX. Escherichia coli was isolated from 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 5 of the 6 isolates were resistant to LVFX; with one of them being extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). CONCLUSION: The frequency of isolation of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens was extremely high among elderly patients in our nursing home compared to values reported from a nation-wide survey recently carried out in Japan. In particular, attention should be focused on the resistance of bacteria to fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis: microbiology and predictors of adverse outcomes.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis, and to identify the potential risk factors for adverse outcomes, with particular reference to the choice of empirical antibiotics, intrapleural fibrinolytics, adherence to management guidelines, and input from pulmonologists. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Regional hospital, Hong Kong. PATIENTS: All patients with a diagnosis of complicated parapneumonic effusion/empyema thoracis admitted between January 2003 and June 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbiological characteristics, mortality, and surgery-free survival. RESULTS. There were 63 patients, with a mean age of 64 (standard deviation, 16) years and a male-to-female ratio of 45:18. The pleural fluid culture positivity rate was 68%; Streptococcus milleri (19%), Bacteroides (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), and Peptostreptococcus (7%) were the most common organisms. Thirteen (21%) patients died during their index admission. Use of intrapleural fibrinolytics according to the guideline was associated with survival (P=0.001) while discordant initial antibiotic use was associated with mortality (P=0.002). Discordant initial antibiotic use was also independently associated with reduced surgery-free survival (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that early intrapleural fibrinolytic use (within 4 days of diagnosis) was associated with decreased mortality (P<0.001), increased surgery-free survival (P=0.005), and shorter hospital stay (P=0.039). CONCLUSION: Organisms identified from complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema thoracis differ from those giving rise to community-acquired pneumonia. In these patients, adherence to guidelines, early concordant antibiotic treatment, intrapleural fibrinolytics, and input from a pulmonologist were associated with improved outcomes.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Early evolution of arterial oxygenation in severe community-acquired pneumonia: a prospective observational study.
AB  - PURPOSE: Acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in severe community-acquired pneumonia has been shown to be a significant negative prognostic factor. We analyzed the early evolution of the Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio and evaluated its clinical value as an outcome predictor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study conducted in a tertiary referral hospital. In 62 adult patients requiring early mechanical ventilation due to severe community-acquired pneumonia, we measured serial changes in Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio and other clinical variables within the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation and compared the difference between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: The initial Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio was lower in nonsurvivors (n = 27) than in survivors (n = 35) (158.0 +/- 55.8 vs 117.9 +/- 50.6, P = .025). Over the next 48 hours, the ratio increased significantly in survivors but not in nonsurvivors (analysis of variance, P < .001). An increase in Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio greater than 56 mm Hg had a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 81% of survival. A definite causative pathogen was identified in 36 patients (58%) and the 3 most commonly isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ten patients received inadequate initial empirical antimicrobial therapy, in which the Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio change was significantly less than those who were adequately treated (analysis of variance, P < .001). Mortality was much higher (86% [6/7]) in patients who received inadequate antibiotics and where Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio change was less than 56 mm Hg. On multivariate analysis, trend changes in Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio over 48 hours, shock, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score were documented to be independent predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A progressive improvement of Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio during the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation indicates favorable outcome. Serial measurement of this ratio should be considered in decision making for therapeutic strategy.
TI  - In vitro availability studies of enoxacin in presence of H2 receptor antagonists.
AB  - Enoxacin is a second-generation quinolone with increased antibacterial activity both in potency as well as in terms of broad spectrum against a wide range of clinically important pathogens over the first generation quinolones and produces its effect by inhibiting bacterial enzyme DNA gyrase. There are a number of drug interactions reported for enoxacin. On the other hand H2-receptor antagonists block gastric acid secretion and some cardiovascular effects of histamine. As the later drugs are used for a long-term therapy, they may be coadministered with other drugs. In present study in vitro release of enoxacin in presence of cimetidine, ranitidine and famotidine has been studied on a B.P. 2003 dissolution test apparatus and compared with the availability of enoxacin and H2-receptor antagonists alone. The interacting drugs were analyzed spectrophotometrically. These studies were carried out in simulated gastric juice, simulating empty stomach, simulated intestinal juice (pH 9) and buffers of pH 7.4 simulating blood pH at 37 degrees C. In order to support these interaction studies, the effect of H2-receptor antagonists on the antibacterial efficacy (MIC) of enoxacin was also studied by turbidity method and compared with parent drug against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus subtilis. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that enoxacin should be coadministered with care along with H2-receptor antagonists especially in case of ranitidine, although chances of adverse reactions are rare but decrease in MIC of enoxacin may result in delayed effect or require prolonged use of the drug.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIM: The mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. We assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. METHODS: Stored clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), Candida albicans (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees C overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 McFarland standard. Dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 U) and 100 microL of the 1.0 McFarland standard broth were incubated at 35 degrees C overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on horse blood agar using 1 microL standard loops. Colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. RESULTS: Heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven S. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500U dose per 200 microL) and one of five H. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition at 7500 U dose per 200 microL), but no inhibition of other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic precursors of podophyllotoxin.
AB  - Precursors of podophyllotoxin were synthesized and screened for their antibacterial activity. The results proved that ethyl-2-(3'-methyl-4'-methoxybenzoyl)-3-(4'' methoxyphenol)-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and Ethyl-2-(3'-methyl-4'-methoxybenzyol-3-1 3'', 4''-dimethoxyphenyl)-cyclopropane-carboxylic acid have significant antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp., Escherchia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei and Streptococcus faecalis. The activity is lower than Ciprofloxacin and equal to Gentamicin and more than Penicillin and Streptomycin.
TI  - A model of myocardial inflammation and dysfunction in burn complicated by sepsis.
AB  - Numerous studies have described that an initial injury alters immune function, disposing the injured subject to infectious complications. The mechanisms by which an initial injury primes the subject, exacerbating the responses to a second injury, remain unclear; however, inflammatory cytokines have been implicated. The development of "2-hit" models has allowed investigators to determine the role of inflammatory mediators in susceptibility to infection after injury. A high incidence rate of pneumonia after burn injury and a significant increase in postburn mortality led us to develop models of either Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) or Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae) sepsis after burn injury on 40% of total body surface area in rodents. In this present model, we used adult Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate cardiac function in vitro (using Langendorff method) and myocardial inflammation (myocyte secretion of cytokines measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) after burn complicated by sepsis. Either burn injury alone or sepsis alone produced myocardial inflammatory responses and contractile dysfunction. Either Gram-negative or Gram-positive infection exacerbated the myocardial inflammation (increased myocyte secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 6) above that which occurred with burn alone or with infection alone. Burn complicated by sepsis exacerbated the myocardial contraction and relaxation defects observed with either sepsis alone or burn alone. Inasmuch as sepsis, which occurs after a previous injury, increases myocardial inflammation/dysfunction and mortality, the development of therapeutic strategies that either decrease inflammatory response to the initial injury or provide cardiac support during the postinjury period may improve the outcome in injured patients who are at risk for developing sepsis.
TI  - Klebsiella pneumoniae in neonatal sepsis: a 3-year-study in the pediatric hospital of Tabriz, Iran.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a life-threatening emergency, and any delay in treatment may cause death. Because of the importance of the problem in Iran, the aim of this retrospective study was to determine the etiological agents of neonatal septicemia, and the prevalence and epidemiology of Klebsiella bacteremia in the neonatal wards. Two hundred and ten cases of neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. The most common organism was coagulase-negative staphylococci. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in 66 cases (31.43%), and the most common Gram-negative organism causing neonatal sepsis was Klebsiella pneumoniae. The mortality rate due to Gram-negative bacteria including K. pneumoniae was higher than that due to other bacteria. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in the Azerbaijan state, northwest of Iran, and K. pneumoniae is predominant, but Streptococcus agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Quercus ilex bark's extracts.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of different extracts of Quercus ilex bark (Fagaceae)  was studied in vitro against seven reference strains of bacteria by using a disc-diffusion method and agar-dilution method. The ethyl acetate extract (QE), n-butanol extract (QB) and final aqueous layer (QA) were effective against all bacterial strains tested at MICs ranging from 128 to 512 microg/ml. The n-hexane extract (QH) and dichloromethane extract (QD) showed no activity.
TI  - Etiology of chronic prostatitis syndrome in patients treated at the university hospital for infectious diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" from 2003 to 2005.
AB  - A total of 835 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis syndrome and no evidence of structural or functional lower genitourinary tract abnormalities were examined in a three year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb, Croatia. Disease etiology was determined in 482 (57.72%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was proved to be the causative pathogen in 161 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 85, Escherichia coli in 68, Enterococcus in 51, Proteus mirabilis in 20, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9, Streptococcus agalactiae in 15, Ureaplasma urealyticum in 49 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had mixed infection. In 257 (53.32%) of 482 patients, the inflammatory finding (>10 WBCs/hpf) was found in EPS or VB3. Normal WBCs/hpf (<10) was found in 103 (63.98%) of 161 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom C. trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB3, in 50 (58.82%) of 85 patients in whom Trichomonas vaginalis was isolated, and in 23 (46.94%) of 49 patients in whom Ureaplasma urealyticum was isolated.
TI  - Microbial and clinical determinants of time-to-positivity in patients with bacteraemia.
AB  - Time-to-positivity is useful in the diagnosis of catheter-related bacteraemia and as a predictor of an endovascular source in patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia. However, this parameter has been evaluated for only a limited number of microorganisms. In the present study, time-to-positivity was recorded for 1872 episodes of significant monomicrobial bacteraemia diagnosed at a teaching hospital during a 2-year period, and the associated microbial and clinical variables were investigated. According to multivariate analysis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Aeromonas were characterised by fast growth, with an endovascular source, shock, liver cirrhosis and neutropenia also predicting a short time-to-positivity. For patients not receiving appropriate antibiotics, detection of Gram-positive cocci in clusters within 14 h was predictive of Staph. aureus; a time-to-positivity of >21 h ruled out the possibility that a Gram-positive organism in chains was a beta-haemolytic streptococcus or Strep. pneumoniae, and a time-to-positivity of < or =12 h meant that it was very unlikely that a Gram-negative bacillus was a non-fermenter. A time-to-positivity of < or =8 h was predictive of a non-urinary tract source in patients with E. coli bacteraemia, and detection of growth within 13 h predicted an endovascular source in those with Staph. aureus bacteraemia. In conclusion, time-to-positivity depended on the microorganism, original source and clinical variables involved. Although this measurement may provide some early clues concerning the microorganisms involved and the source of bacteraemia, its clinical impact remains to be defined.
TI  - Bacteriological study of pyogenic meningitis with special reference to latex agglutination.
AB  - Bacterial meningitis is an important and frequent devastating disease. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of pyogenic meningitis in our hospital in children and to find out the sensitivity of Gram stain, CRP and latex agglutination tests for the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis from CSF sample. Out of 150 CSF samples studied, 40 were diagnosed as pyogenic meningitis. H. influenzae was the commonest organism (22.5%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae 15%, Staphylococcus aureus--10%, Acinetobacter species and coagulase negative Stapylococci 7.5% each, E-coli 5%, and a case each of Klebsiella species, Group B streptococci, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Enterococci. The sensitivity of Gram stain and Latex agglutination test was 90% and that of CRP test was 62.5%. As most of the cases included in our study were treated earlier, the culture positivity was only 62.5%. Hence, Gram stain and/or latex agglutination tests, if done properly are most rapid and reliable tests for the diagnosis of pyogenic meningitis.
TI  - In vitro reconstitution of antimicrobial pathogen activity by expressed recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal peptide in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Recombinant bovine lactoferrin N-terminal polypeptide (rbLF-N) Escherichia coli expression system was constructed and the rbLF-N antimicrobial activity was displayed by enzymatic proteolysis in this study. A 162 bp 5'-terminal fragment of bovine lactoferrin (bLF) gene from bovine liver gDNA was amplified by PCR. The DNA fragment containing exon-2 of the bLF gene was cloned into the expression vector pGEX-4T1 and the glutathione-S-transferase-rbLF-N (GST-rbLF-N) fusion protein was obtained by over-expression in Esch. coli BL21(DE3). After thrombin/pepsin digestion, the rbLF-N was released from the fusion protein. The recombinant peptide was separated and identified by SDS-PAGE, HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis. A very strong anti-food-born microbial pathogen activity of the rbLF-N peptides was displayed through bio- and kinetic-assays in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the rbLF-N peptide for bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Esch. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 11.7, 11.7, 11.7, 23.4 microg and 23.4, 11.7, 11.7, 46.4 microg, respectively. This study created a new route for exploring lactoferrin peptide application in food science.
TI  - [Clinical, morphological, and microbiological characteristics of the Mallory-Weiss syndrome].
AB  - The profound clinico-morphological and immunological analysis was performed in patients suffering Mallory-Weiss syndrome (MWS). Doing endoscopic and morphological investigations the most dangerous foci of the affection were revealed and there links with the disease course severity and the recurrences rate established. The signs of unstable haemostasis were revealed according to the endoscopic investigation data. Morphological changes of gastric mucosa in patients suffering MWS are similar to those in duodenal ulcer disease. Polymorphism of mucosal microorganisms with E. coli, Streptococcus beta-haemoliticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans predominance, which severe the disease course and cause the haemorrhage recurrence, was characteristic for MWS in 85% of observations. These causing agents are sensitive to II-III generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolons in 75% of observations. The complex of conservative treatment must include, besides restorational, untiulcer, antihelicobacter and antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Aspiration pneumonias: under-diagnosed and under-treated.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine recent advancements of the epidemiology, risk factors, bacteriology, diagnostic measures, and treatment for aspiration pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS: In a large prospective study, 10.3% of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization was associated with aspiration pneumonia, as opposed to 30% when patients were admitted from long-term facilities. A murine stroke model showed increased apoptosis of cell-mediated immune cells due to overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system. Subsequent nasal inoculum of low-dose Streptococcus pneumoniae caused severe pneumonia. Another murine study showed intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid-primed lungs more susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tracheal pH monitoring demonstrated acidification of trachea in 28% of patients with acute stroke deemed to be safe for oral feeding. Various antimicrobial agents used to treat aspiration pneumonia have comparable success rates. However, clindamycin was the only agent that did not propagate emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SUMMARY: Aspiration pneumonia is prevalent in community-acquired pneumonia. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of sympathetic nervous system and aspiration pneumonitis as primers for lung infection. Predicting aspiration risk is difficult and newer diagnostic tools are necessary. Antimicrobials used in aspiration pneumonia have similar success rates although the development of resistant organisms must be monitored.
TI  - Screening of the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on microorganisms responsible for respiratory infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the cytotoxicity and the antibacterial effects of a variety of essential oils on major respiratory tract pathogens. The cytotoxicity of 13 essential oils was evaluated on Vero cells. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby Bauer paper method, minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against Streptococcus pyogenes, agalactiae, pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolated from clinical specimens. The antibiotic sensitivity of these isolates was examined. Some oils showed inhibition of bacterial growth against most of the organisms examined. Cinnamon and thyme showed the strongest action followed by clove. The results reported in this paper indicate that thyme can be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent for the treatment of some respiratory tract infections in man.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia using the BacT/Alert 3D system.
AB  - We compared BacT/Alert 3D with conventional culture for the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed with the disk diffusion method, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated. Automation was superior in terms of recovery and time to detect pathogens. The bacterial spectrum in CAP was Streptococcus pneumoniae (35.3%) Staphylococcus aureus (23.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8.8%). Three of the 12 S. pneumoniae isolates showed penicillin resistance on MIC and two showed erythromycin resistance. There were two H. influenzae strains resistant to penicillin; these were beta lactamase producers. One-fourth of the S. aureus were oxacillin resistant. All isolates were sensitive to cefepime by disc diffusion and MIC methods. In the treatment of CAP, cefotaxime and cefepime are useful drugs when given as empirical therapy against multidrug resistant strains. The use of automation is vital in CAP, as rapid diagnosis and effective therapy can reduce mortality.
TI  - Synthesis, stereochemistry and antimicrobial evaluation of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-one and its derivatives.
AB  - In a wide research program toward new and efficient antimicrobial agents, a series of t(3)-benzyl-r(2),c(6)-diarylpiperidin-4-ones (1-7) were synthesised and tested for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities. Also, the structures and their stereochemistry of these synthesised compounds 1-7 were characterized by IR, high resolution (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (1)H-(13)C COSY spectra. The analysis of coupling constants of compounds 1-5 reveals that they exist in normal chair conformation with equatorial orientations of all the substituents. The spectra of 6 and 7 reveal the presence of two isomers labeled as E (carbonyl carbon is anti to benzyl group at C-3) and Z (carbonyl carbon is syn to benzyl group at C-3) in solution and the coupling constants ruled out the possibility of normal chair conformation. From the theoretical studies and coupling constant values the favoured conformation for the Z- and E-isomers of 6 and 7 was found to be the boat conformations. Their antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae and antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida 6, Candida 51, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus were also evaluated.
TI  - Bacterial isolates of blood cultures in patients with suspected septicaemia in Ilorin, Nigeria.
AB  - Periodic bacteriologic surveillance of blood cultures is a necessity. To determine currently prevalent bacterial pathogens of blood cultures in patients with suspected septicaemia in Ilorin. Nigeria. Three thousand and fifty-seven patients from all age and sex groups with clinical suspicion of septicaemia underwent bacteriologic screening of their blood specimen over a 13 month period starting from January. 2003. Twenty point three percent were positive for bacterial growth. An incidence of 41.7 per 1000 admissions was recorded which was a statistically significant (p< 0.05) marginal increase when compared with the previous incidence of 37.9 per 1000 admissions from this centre. Majority of the isolates were gram negative (51.61%) though the single predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (35.85%). Other isolates included Escherichia coli (32.48%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.74%), Proteus spp (0.32%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (1.61%), Salmonella typhi (0.48%). beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (0.48%) and Acinetobacter spp (0.32%). No anaerobe was isolated. Most isolates were sensitive to fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, perfloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) except Acinetobacter that was 100% resistant to both groups of antibiotics. Gram positive isolates were resistant to the second generation cephalosporin, cefuroxime. We hereby recommend the use of combination of a third generation cephalosporin and fluoroquinolones where not contraindicated, in the empiric treatment of septicaemia before sensitivity results are available.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Taiwan with an emphasis on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of AECOPD. METHODS: Medical records from 494 episodes of AECOPD in patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 to June 2004 were reviewed. Severity of COPD was classified according to the 2003 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guideline. RESULTS: Potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), Enterobacter species (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. Spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage I COPD (39.1%) than stage II (16.6%), III (13.8%) and IV (9.4%). No glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage I patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that P. aeruginosa (odds ratio (OR) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-8.38), intubation (OR 14.81; 95% CI: 5.08-43.12) and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Taiwan, with the former being more commonly isolated from mild COPD and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. These results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with AECOPD.
TI  - [Distribution of bacteria isolated from urine cultures in Malatya University Hospital laboratory (letter)].
AB  - The aim of this letter was to report the distribution of bacterial species isolated from the urine samples of patients in Malatya, which is located in Estern Anatolia part of Turkey. A total of 3.774 urine cultures were performed in the period of April-June 2006, and 792 (21%) of them yielded bacterial growth. The isolates have been identified by conventional methods and confirmed by Phoenix 100 (Becton-Dickinson) system. As a result, 702 (89%) Gram negative and 90 (11%) Gram positive bacteria were isolated from the samples. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (58%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (14%), Pseudomonas spp. (6.4%), Enterococcus spp. (5%), Staphylococcus spp. (3.8%) and Streptococcus spp. (1.7%). The species distribution was found as follows; K. pneumoniae ssp pneumoniae (95/110), P. aeruginosa (48/51), E.faecalis (27/40), E. cloacae (19/29), P.mirabilis (19/22), C.freundii (8/12), coagulase negative staphylococci (19/30) and S. aureus (11/30). The first three array were shared by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for the samples of both outpatients and inpatients, while Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli were the most frequently isolated bacteria from the urine samples of intensive care unit patients. Our data was found parallel to the results of other national and international studies.
TI  - Amniotic membrane transplantation in severe bacterial keratitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a combination of early amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and early topical corticosteroid treatment could be a safe adjuvant therapy during antibacterial treatment in severe bacterial keratitis (BK) for relieving pain, avoiding iatrogenic epithelial toxicity, and allowing earlier use of topical steroids. METHODS: In a prospective noncomparative case series, 12 patients with severe microscopically-proven BK were treated with immediate maximal topical antibiotics followed by AMT at 48 hours (single-layer epithelial side-down or multilayer epithelial side-up), plus topical steroid treatment at 72 hours. Pain relief (NRS-11 numeric rating pain scale) and the corneal epithelium healing were measured. RESULTS: The follow-up rate was 7.5 person-months, with AMT performed once in 2 patients and twice in 10 patients with BK caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Moraxella cattharalis (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), or Streptococcus pneumoniae (1). A significant decrease in the pain score was noted from the admission day (median, 8; range, 7-10) to shortly after AMT (at day 3: median, 2; range, 1-3). Epithelial healing was achieved between 8 and 45 days (mean, 25.5 +/- 9.7 days). Neither perforation nor neovascularization was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early AMT combined with topical corticosteroid in severe BK provides immediate pain relief and allows epithelial healing.
TI  - Exploring the antibacterial and hemolytic activity of shorter- and longer-chain beta-, alpha,beta-, and gamma-peptides, and of beta-peptides from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids bearing proteinogenic side chains--a survey.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 31 different beta-, mixed alpha/beta-, and gamma-peptides, as well as of beta-peptides derived from beta2-3-aza- and beta3-2-methylidene-amino acids were assayed against six pathogens (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the results were compared with literature data. The interaction of these peptides with mammalian cells, as modeled by measuring the hemolysis of human erythrocytes, was also investigated. In addition to those peptides designed to fold into amphiphilic helical conformations with positive charges on one face of the helix, one new peptide with hemolytic activity was detected within the sample set. Moreover, it was demonstrated that neither cationic peptides used for membrane translocation (beta3-oligoarginines), nor mixed alpha/beta- or gamma-peptides with somatostatin-mimicking activities display unwanted hemolytic activity.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2004)].
AB  - From October 2004 to September 2005, we collected the specimen from 319 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 383 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 381 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 87, Streptococcus pneumoniae 80, Haemophilus influenzae 78, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 35, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 9, Klebsiella pneumoniae 15, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 30, etc. Of 87 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/mL or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-sensitive S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were 40 (46.0%) and 47 (54.0%) strains, respectively. Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/mL. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the potent activity and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for ABK (2.5%), erythromycin (37.5%), and clindamycin (38.8%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Meropenem showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), amikacin (AMK) had the most potent activity and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP against the non-mucoid type also was preferable and its MIC90 was 8 microg/mL. Against K. pneumoniae, CZOP, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, flomoxef were the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed a potent activity against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (57.0%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 50.8% and 23.8% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (21.6%), S. pneumoniae (24.7%) and H. influenzae (20.1%). S. aureus (20.9%), S. pneumoniae (16.1%), and H. influenzae (16.1%) also were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (22.3%) and H. influenzae (25.1%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with macrolides were P. aeruginosa and the isolation frequency was 43.5%.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - [The last case of smallpox in Denmark--the organizing conditions in 1970].
AB  - Smallpox contributed to many deaths in Denmark up to the introduction of the vaccination in the beginning of the 19th. Century. The last minor smallpox epidemic in Denmark was in 1924, and subsequently no doctors had special experience in smallpox. In September 1970 a Norwegian medical student died from smallpox in Copenhagen after returning from a journey to Afghanistan, where he has been hospitalized for enteritis. During the 5 days in Copenhagen before hospitalization he had had extensive contacts with many people. He was hospitalized at Blegdamshospital and was isolated, and the diagnosis of smallpox was verified on day 5. He was then totally isolated in a pavilion with 2 nurses and one doctor. The initial diarrhoea (Salmonella typhimurium), and later septicaemia with salmonella, the copious expectoration up to 1 1/2 l pr day (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, 9-streptococci), the enormous exudation from the desquamated skin caused large problems concerning water, electrolytes and protein balance, requiring an input up to 13 1 per day. It was necessary to perform tracheotomy and artificial ventilation. He was treated as a patient with extensive burns with metal sheets and when his body temperature fell to 30 degrees C with electrical heat. He died after 25 days of smallpox with complicating extensive skin ulavs corresponding to a pathological picture of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). The containment was successful in cooperation with the Danish National Board on Health, the Medical Officer of Health from Copenhagen and the county (where the patient lived), police, State Serum Institute, and Ministries of the Interior and Foreign Affairs. Vaccination of the exposed persons and the hospital staff, isolation in small groups (maximum 20 persons) of 589 primary contacts in the hospital pavilion-wards and 12 military tents were performed. No secondary cases occurred. The outbreak of smallpox in Copenhagen ended, and the city was not declared "local infected area", and we avoided a panic mass vaccination of large group of people. The article describes these activities, which are effectuated within a few days and headed by a capable and unanimous leadership, in a serious and complicated situation and with an engaged cooperation from the whole staff.
TI  - Pneumocystis jirovecii and microbiological findings in children with severe pneumonia in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the significance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the Kenyan paediatric population. DESIGN: Sixty samples of induced sputum from children aged < or =23 months, half of whom were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, admitted with severe pneumonia in Nairobi were subjected to immunofluorescent staining for detection of P. jirovecii and microbiological culture. RESULTS: P. jirovecii was detected in 8/60 (13%) as a copathogen with other respiratory pathogens. Five of eight samples with >5 oocysts were from HIV-positive children aged < or =6 months, while equivocally scored samples (< or =5 oocysts) were from HIV-negative children aged >6 months. Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly recovered in 26/ 60 (43%), followed by Escherichia coli 11/60 (18%) and Staphylococcus aureus 8/60 (13%). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated infrequently. Candida albicans was recovered from 27/60 (45%), while the frequency of C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. parapsilosis was 7%, 5% and 3% respectively. Multidrug resistance among E. coli and K. pneumoniae were: sulphamethoxazoletrimethoprim 100% vs. 69%, chloramphenicol 55% vs. 73% and ampicillin 100% vs. 89%. CONCLUSION: Paediatricians in Kenya should be aware of Pneumocystis pneumonia, irrespective of the patient's HIV status.
TI  - The relationship between quinolone exposures and resistance amplification is characterized by an inverted U: a new paradigm for optimizing pharmacodynamics to counterselect resistance.
AB  - We determined the relationship between garenoxacin exposure and quinolone-resistant subpopulations for three bacterial isolates in an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model. An "inverted-U" relationship was identified wherein resistant subpopulations rose initially and then declined with increasing exposure, until reaching a threshold that prevented resistance amplifications. Different targets for the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h/MIC ratio were required for different bacteria.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - [Detection of etiologic agents and antibiotic resistance in children with acute lower respiratory tract infection in Wenzhou City].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in children in Wenzhou City remains poorly defined. This study investigated the etiological agents responsible for acute LRTI and patterns of the antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens in children with acute LRTI from Wenzhou City. METHODS: Lower respiratory tract secretions were obtained from 454 children with acute LRTI (aged 1 month to 10 years, median age 6 months) within 24 hrs after admission for bacterial culture. Meanwhile respiratory viruses were detected by the Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) assay. The K-B method was applied for the drug susceptibility test. RESULTS: Etiological agents were identified in 297 cases out of 454 patients (65.4%. Viral pathogens were identified in 229 cases (50.4%), bacteria in 135 cases (29.7%) and mixed viral-bacterial infections in 67 cases (14.8%). The isolating rate of Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the highest (180 cases, 39.6%) in all of the samples. The isolating rates of other viral pathogens were as follows: Parainfluenza virus 3 type (PIV3) (6.6%), Adenovirus (2.2%), Influenza A (0.9%) and Influenza B (0.7%). Of the 135 strains of bacterial pathogens, 19 kinds of bacterial pathogens were isolated. The predominant isolate was Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (9.9%), followed by Escherichia coli (E.coli) (4.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (4.2%). The isolating rates of K. pneumoniae and E.coli with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases strains (ESBLs) positive were 42.2% and 65.0%, respectively. The pathogens isolated of the first 5 places in children with acute LRTI under six months were RSV, K. pneumoniae, PIV3, E.coli and S. aureus in turn. RSV, PIV3, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae and E.coli were found to be the pathogens of the first 5 places in children with acute LRTI between six months and three years. The resistant rates of K. pneumoniae and E.coli to ampicillin were 97.8% and 75.0%, respectively. K. pneumoniae and E.coli with positive ESBLs were resistant to cephalosporin. The resistant rates of S. pneumoniae to erythromycin and penicilin were 100% and 68.4%, respectively. The resistant rates of S. aureus to erythromycin and penicillin were 94.7% and 89.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: RSV is the most common pathogen responsible for acute LRTI in children in Wenzhou City, followed by K. pneumoniae and PIV3. The rate of antibiotic resistance of common bacteria and the isolating rate of Gram-negative bacillus with ESBLs positive are high.
TI  - [Pathogenic bacteria of childhood lower respiratory tract infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogenic bacteria of lower respiratory tract infection  (LRTI), and age and gender distribution and drug resistance of the pathogenic bacteria in children. METHODS: Sputum specimens for bacterial cultures were collected in sterile tubes from all of the children with LRTI who had been admitted to the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University between August 2001 and July 2002. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed using the Vitek system, the Kirby-Bauer diffuse method and the Etest method after bacteria were identified. RESULTS: Among the 4,238 patients with LRTI during the study period, 1,181 patients were bacteria-positive, with a positive rate of 27.9%. Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) was the most common (222 strains), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) (216 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (216 strains), Escherichia coil (E. coli) (169 strains) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (89 strains). The isolation rate of S. pneumoniae in females was significantly higher than in males (6.2% vs 4.7%; P < 0.05). However, the isolation rates of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus in males were higher than in females (5.1% vs 4.1% and 2.5% vs 1.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). A higher incidence of LRTI due to S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae was found in the 1-3 years group, while the incidence of LRTI due to K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. aureus and E. cloacae was higher in patients under 1 year of age. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed that rates of penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, ampicillin resistant H. influenzae, oxacillin-resistant S. aureus and ESBL-positive K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 55.0%, 16.5%, 41.2%, 42.6% and 4.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. aureus were common pathogens of LRTI in children. The infection rate varied with age and gender. Antibiotics for treating LRTI should be selected based on the drug susceptibility test.
TI  - [Characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  - War wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. Wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. War wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. This environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. War wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. The infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. Time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. Apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection. These are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. The determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. The etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp and Enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family Enterobacteriacea (Escherichia coil, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus - A. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods Clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods Bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; Peptostreptococcus spp and Peptococcus spp. The latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. Early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. Empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. The choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. It is used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. The characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. The use of antibiotics is not a substitution for surgical treatment. The expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. If the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. The keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ertapenem against major intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - Treatment of intra-abdominal infections remains a challenge owing to their polymicrobial nature and associated mortality risk. Treatment regimens must provide broad-spectrum coverage, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria of gastrointestinal origin. Ertapenem is a long-acting 1-beta-methyl parenteral group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-daily dosing supported by clinical studies. It is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. The aim of this study was to measure the killing effects of ertapenem against a selected group of strains responsible for intra-abdominal infections. Gram-negative isolates comprised the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis (extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers and non-producers). Gram-positive isolates comprised methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Enterococcus faecalis and anaerobic Bacteroides fragilis. Ertapenem activity was tested by determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs). Killing curves were performed in monocultures and co-cultures at selected antibiotic concentrations. Ertapenem showed a rapid and potent bactericidal activity in the first few hours of the kinetic curves against E. coli (6 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) reduction in the first 2h), B. fragilis (4 log(10) CFU reduction in 4h), MSSA (3 log(10) CFU reduction in 4-6h), K. ozaenae (ESBL+), K. pneumoniae (ESBL+ and -), E. cloacae (ESBL-) in 1h and P. mirabilis (ESBL+) in the first 2h. The potent bactericidal activity of ertapenem compared with ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam was well demonstrated in the co-cultures of E. coli-B. fragilis and E. coli-B. fragilis-E. faecalis, whilst ertapenem was shown to be bactericidal at 24h in the mixed culture of S. aureus-P. mirabilis. These results support the potent in vitro bactericidal activity of ertapenem against all multiresistant strains selected in this study and the use of this drug in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Etiological agents of dairy cows' mastitis in western part of Poland.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the etiological mastitis agents in cows from herds located in the western part of Poland in years 2003-2005. Bacteriological examinations of 18,713 samples taken from California Mastitis Test (CMT) positive quarters were performed according to standard methods. Some Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci were examined with the use of API tests (Analytical Profile Index). It was found that 32.7% of samples that were CMT positive were culture negative and 9.3% of samples were contaminated. Streptococcus species (15.7%), coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (14.6%), Staph. aureus (8.6%), Gram-negative bacilli (4.0%) and Corynebacterium species (3.8%) were most frequently isolated. Escherichia coli (52.3%) dominated among Gram-negative bacilli followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (3.6%), Serratia marcescens (3.1%), Pasteurella multocida (3.1%), Acinetobacter lwofii (3.1%), and 26 other bacteria species. Stahylococcus xylosus (31.5%), Staph. hyicus (12.2%), Staph. haemolyticus (12.2%), Staph. sciuri (11.6%), Staph. chromogenes (8.8%), Staph. epidermidis (8.3%) and Staph. simulans (6.1%) were the most frequent CNS. Streptococcus uberis (50%), Str. dysgalactiae (19.7%), Str. acidominimus (6.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%) were mostly found among CAMP-negative streptococci. An increase in frequency of mastitis caused by non-agalactiae streptococci, Staph. aureus, A. pyogenes and yeast-like fungi and a decrease in that produced by Str. agalactiae in 2005 as compared to years 2003 or 2004 were observed.
TI  - Bacterial capsular antigens. Structural patterns of capsular antigens.
AB  - Structural patterns of bacterial capsular antigens including capsular polysaccharides and exoglycans are given in this review. In addition, the immunological activity of capsular antigens and their role in type specificity of bacteria are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - In vitro activities of ertapenem against drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae  and other respiratory pathogens from 12 Asian countries.
AB  - In vitro activities of ertapenem and 11 other comparator agents were tested against 1025 isolates of respiratory pathogens collected from 12 Asian countries. Resistance rate to ertapenem was 1.2% in 602 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50), 0.06/MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). Ertapenem was also very active against penicillin-, ciprofloxacin-, erythromycin-, and multidrug-resistant pneumococcal isolates (resistance rate: 3.5%, 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.7%, respectively). Ertapenem-resistant pneumococcal isolates were found only in Vietnam and Korea. Ertapenem resistance was not found in methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers. In vitro data suggest that ertapenem could be a useful treatment option for community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Effect of dietary fish-oil on survival of experimental animals after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella pneumoniae.]
AB  - Objective: Dietary fish-oil has beneficial effect in infections and in autoimmune disorders. This effect is thought to be associated with alterations in the immune system. The Gram negative organism Klebsiella pneumoniae has been used as an infective agent in most studies investigating the effect of dietary fish-oil on infection. The immune response against Gram positive bacteria is somewhat different to the response to Gram negative oeganisms. Moreover, the Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae is a very common pathogen, particularly in children. To investigate whether dietary fish-oil has different effect in infections by Gram positive or Gram negative bacteria, we studied the survival of mice fed with fish-oil or corn-oil supplemented diets and infected in the lungs with either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Materials and methods: 120 NMRI mice were divided into four groups and fed diets supplemented with fish-oil (two groups, 30 mice in each group) or corn-oil (two groups, 30 mice in each group). After six weeks, the mice were infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae (fish-oil group and corn-oil group) or with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (fish-oil group and corn-oil group). The survival was monitored. The experiment was performed twice. Results: The survival of the mice infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly better in the groups receiving the fish-oil enriched diet as compared to the groups fed the corn-oil enriched diet (p=0.0001 and 0.0013). There was no difference in the survival of mice infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, receiving the fish-oil or corn-oil enriched diets (p=0.74 and p=0.15). Conclusions: These results indicate that dietary fish-oil has beneficial effect on survival of mice after experimental infection with the Gram negative bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae but not on experimental infections with the Gram positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3.
TI  - Assessment of pathogen frequency and resistance patterns among pediatric patient  isolates: report from the 2004 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program on 3 continents.
AB  - Selecting empiric or directed therapy for pathogens isolated from pediatric patients can be problematic. Many antimicrobial agents are not indicated for use in pediatric patients, and regional variations of resistance mechanisms have been reported. The purpose of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance patterns and pathogen occurrence rates in pediatric-aged patient infections on 3 continents using data from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. A total of 3537 clinical isolates were collected from 47 medical centers in 2004. With a protocol that dictated a sampling of 80 consecutive isolates from children (< or =18 years of age), all samples were forwarded to a central laboratory for reference susceptibility testing. Broth microdilution methods and current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint criteria were used. The 15 most frequently observed pathogens accounted for 93.6% of all isolates. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen isolated in North America (27.4%) and Europe (19.0%), but Escherichia coli was most common in Latin America (19.3%). All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains from North America and Latin America were susceptible to the newer fluoroquinolones, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin. However, 2 S. pneumoniae strains from Italy were resistant to gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin (> or =4 microg/mL). Ribotype and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns found that these resistant pneumococci were clonal. Numerous strains of Klebsiella spp. (22.5%), E. coli (4.5%), and Proteus mirabilis (4.9%) exhibited phenotypic extended-spectrum beta-lactamase resistance patterns. Four Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains (3 from Latin America and 1 from Europe) were multidrug resistant, 2 P. aeruginosa isolates from Turkey were resistant to polymyxin B (> or =4 microg/mL), and 8.7% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates from Latin America were resistant to the "drug of choice", trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Physicians should be aware of pathogen occurrences that vary by children's age, geographic location, and prior antimicrobial exposure. Therefore, continued surveillance will be necessary to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance in the pediatric patient population, especially because new agents such as the fluoroquinolones are used to a greater extent in this age group.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli: simulation of human plasma concentrations after intravenous dosage in an in vitro kinetic model.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare in an in vitro kinetic model the pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin with a concentration-time profile simulating the human free non-protein bound concentrations of 400 mg moxifloxacin intravenous (iv) once daily, 500 mg levofloxacin iv once daily and 750 mg levofloxacin iv once daily against strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with variable susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. METHODS: The strains used in the study included S. pneumoniae ATCC 6306 (native strain), S. pneumoniae 19397 (double mutation; gyrA and parC), S. pneumoniae 4241 (single mutation; parC), S. aureus ATCC 13709 (native strain), S. aureus MB5 (single mutation; gyrA), E. coli M12 (single mutation; gyrA), E. coli ATCC 25922 (native strain) and K. pneumoniae ATCC 29655 (native strain). The strains were exposed to moxifloxacin and levofloxacin in an in vitro kinetic model simulating the free human serum concentration-time profile of moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily, levofloxacin 500 mg once daily and 750 mg once daily. Repeated samples were taken regularly during 24 h and viable counts were carried out. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A correlation was seen between both the area under the serum concentration curve and MIC (AUC/MIC) and the peak concentration/MIC (Cmax/MIC) versus area under the bactericidal killing curve (AUBKC) or Deltalog0-24 cfu/mL. Compiling all data, an AUC/MIC of approximately 100 and a Cmax/MIC of 10 gave a maximal bactericidal effect for both levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. In accordance with the results from others, our study indicated that a lower AUC/MIC was needed for S. pneumoniae in comparison with the Gram-negative bacteria studied. Moxifloxacin yielded higher AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC against the investigated Gram-positive bacteria in comparison with levofloxacin 500 mg once daily and 750 mg once daily.
TI  - Comparisons of parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporins tested against bacterial  isolates from pediatric patients: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2004).
AB  - A contemporary collection of 12737 strains from pediatric patients (<18 years) isolated over a 7-year period (1998-2004) from 52 sentinel hospitals in North America was tested to determine the comparative antimicrobial potency of broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporins and selected comparator agents. Most of the strains (84.1%) were isolated from blood stream or respiratory tract infections. The rank order of the top 10 pediatric pathogens analyzed was Streptococcus pneumoniae (15.5%) >Haemophilus influenzae (14.6%) >Staphylococcus aureus (13.8%) >Moraxella catarrhalis = coagulase-negative staphylococci (8.0%) >Escherichia coli (7.8%) >Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.2%) >Klebsiella spp. (4.8%) >Enterococcus spp. (4.7%) > beta-hemolytic streptococci (4.4%). Both cefepime and ceftriaxone (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 93.9% and 93.7% susceptible, respectively) were highly active against S. pneumoniae. However, the S. pneumoniae strains showed reduced susceptibility to ceftazidime (56.6%), as well as penicillin (56.6%) < trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (57.1%) < erythromycin (66.2%) < tetracycline (71.4%). beta-Hemolytic streptococci showed 100.0% susceptibility to penicillin, cefepime, and ceftriaxone. Cefepime and ceftriaxone exhibited high activity against oxacillin (methicillin)-susceptible S. aureus, (MIC(90), 4 microg/mL; 100.0% and 99.8% susceptible, respectively), whereas ceftazidime (MIC(90), 16 microg/mL) was active against only 86.7% of strains. H. influenzae strains showed complete susceptibility to cefepime, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin (MIC(90), < or =0.5 microg/mL; 100.0%), and 34.0% of H. influenzae and 99.2% of M. catarrhalis strains produced beta-lactamase. Although the 3 cephalosporins tested (cefepime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime) were very active (98.6-99.6% susceptible) against E. coli, cefepime (99.0% susceptible) was slightly more active than ceftriaxone and ceftazidime (96.4% and 95.1% susceptible, respectively) against Klebsiella spp. Cefepime was also the most active beta-lactam agent tested against Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 99.3% susceptible), whereas the susceptibility rates of other broad-spectrum beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime and piperacillin-tazobactam) were significantly lower (78.4-81.5%). Against P. aeruginosa, imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed the highest susceptibility rates (94.4% and 93.3%, respectively), whereas imipenem and cefepime showed the lowest resistance rates (1.4% and 2.3%, respectively). Our results indicate that cefepime was the most broad-spectrum cephalosporin analyzed and remains a very potent alternative for the treatment of contemporary pediatric infections in North America.
TI  - 1H NMR spectroscopy in the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced urinary tract infection.
AB  - The (1)H NMR spectroscopic method is suggested and its utility is demonstrated for the diagnosis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) in urinary tract infection (UTI). K. pneumoniae have the specific property of metabolizing glycerol to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD), acetate, ethanol and succinate. The quantity of 1,3-PD produced correlates well with the viable bacterial count. Other common bacteria causing UTI (except for Citrobacter frundii), such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter baumanii, Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gp B and Staphylococcus aureus do not metabolize glycerol under similar conditions. Citrobacter frundii (C. frundii) also gives the same NMR results but is easily differentiated as being motile on direct microscopic examination of urine and it is not common nosocomial infectious agent in urinary tract infection. The method provides a single-step documentation of K. pneumoniae (and C. frundii) qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Out of the total 614 subjects considered, clinical diagnosis of UTI was obtained in 516 cases (84%). The NMR-based screening had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 100% and a false negativity of 10% relative to the conventional quantitative culture method. In the present authors' experience, the results of NMR spectroscopy based screening show a very good correlation with the diagnosis of urinary tract infected patients.

TI  - Faecal coliform bacteria in Febros river (northwest Portugal): temporal variation, correlation with water parameters, and species identification.
AB  - Febros river water was sampled weekly, during 35 successive weeks, and analyzed for microbiological (total coliforms, faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and enterococci) and chemical-physical (ammonia and temperature) parameters. All microbiological parameters were highly correlated with each other and with ammonia, suggesting that the simultaneous determination of all variables currently in use in the evaluation of the microbiological quality of waters is probably redundant, and could be simplified, and that ammonia should be tested as a sentinel parameter of the microbiological pollution load of Febros river. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms test (multiple tube fermentation technique) and retested in this assay, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae strains were positive, indicating that the faecal coliforms test is not totally specific for Escherichia coli, and can detect other bacteria. Considering that these Klebsiella spp. are not necessarily of faecal origin, it was concluded that the faecal coliforms test can overestimate true faecal pollution. From the strains isolated from positive tubes of the faecal coliforms procedure, only Escherichia coli strains were clearly positive in the beta-D-glucuronidase test. All other species were negative or very weakly positive, suggesting that the assay of the beta-D-glucuronidase activity is less prone to false positives than the faecal coliforms test in the quantification of Escherichia coli in environmental waters.
TI  - [Clinical effect of continuous infusion of meropenem on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the clinical effect of continuous infusion over 24 hours of meropenem  (MEPM) on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly (over 65). The subjects were 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, n = 9; severe, n= 4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, n = 13) whose performance status was 3 or 4. MEPM 1.0g/day was infused continuously for 7-14 days, and its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and side effects were examined prospectively. It was effective in 23 of the 26 patients (community-acquired pneumonia: moderate, 8/9; severe, 3/4; hospital-acquired pneumonia: group III, 12/13; efficacy rate: 88.5%). Bactericidal effects were obtained in 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphlococcus aureus, 1 strain of Streptococcus agalactiae and 1 strain of Proteus mirabilis, but not in 2 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 1 strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1 strain of Serratia marcescens. Mild abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 2 patients: elevation of GPT, gamma-GTP, BUN and elevation of ALP. Based on the above, continuous infusion of MEPM on bacterial pneumonia in the elderly obtained excellent clinical effects. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of continuous versus intermittent administration of MEPM.
TI  - [Use of transport medium in sputum bacterial culture examination of lower airway  infection].
AB  - Our medical institution does not have a bacterial culture facility, requiring outsourcing of bacterial culture tests. Due to the time elapsed from the time of specimen collection to culturing, the identification of causative bacteria in respiratory tract infections tends to be difficult. We therefore used transport medium for sputum bacteria examinations. Expectorated purulent or purulent-mucous sputum specimens were collected from 32 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. We divided each of the sputum specimens into the two treatment groups: transport medium (Seedswab gamma2) ndar and stad disinfection container. Paired samples prepared from each patient were sent out for bacterial culture together. The time elapsed from collection to delivery to the lab were as follows: day 0 (same day, n = 14 patients), day 1 (n = 15), day 2 (n = 2), and day 3 (n = 1). The identified causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1), and Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 1). Samples prepared by each of the two methods gave similar results. The utility of transport medium for examination of general bacteria for lower airway infection from sputum samples was not demonstrated. The rate of detection of bacteria decreased, when the transport of samples was delayed. Therefore, we need to send the sputum specimens as quickly as possible.
TI  - Disease transmission in horses.
AB  - Bacterial, viral and protozoal infections may cause severe reproductive losses. The present paper reviews the risk factors, clinical signs and preventive measures for the most important venereal or potential sexually transmitted diseases in horses. The stallion and use of semen for artificial insemination represent major risk factors for the transmission of bacterial contaminants of the penis, including Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, known to cause endometritis and infertility in the mare. The role of the stallion in disease transmission is also due to the non-clinical manifestation of diseases such as contagious equine metritis and equine viral arteritis. Dourine has been eradicated from many countries, but continues to be a problem in other areas of the globe. Strategies for the prevention of introduction and transmission of diseases in breeding operation are discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Substance P and Neuropeptide Y against laboratory strains of bacteria and oral microorganisms.
AB  - Infection and inflammation of mucosal tissue may induce the production of neuropeptides, specifically Substance P and Neuropeptide Y. Since these neuropeptides are similar to antimicrobial peptides in their amino acid composition, amphipathic design, cationic charge, and size, we wanted to determine if they had antimicrobial activity against a panel of common bacteria and oral microorganisms using the radial diffusion assay. Neuropeptide Y and Substance P had antimicrobial activity against E. coli (MIC 20.6+/-5.5 microg/ml SEM and 71.5+/-15 SEM microg/ml, respectively), but did not have activity against laboratory strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (MIC>500 microg/ml) nor oral strains of Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (MIC>500 microg/ml). While Substance P and Neuropeptide Y did not have direct antimicrobial activity against the microorganisms tested, they still may stimulate local epithelial cells to produce other innate immune factors like defensins and cathelicidins. However, this remains to be determined.
TI  - [Guidelines for treatment of pneumonia in intensive care units].
AB  - Patients affected by pneumonia can be admitted in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) independently by the setting where the infection has been acquired (community, hospital, long-term care facilities); even more frequently pneumonia can develop in patients already hospitalized in ICU especially in those requiring mechanical ventilation for different reasons. Within the severe community acquired pneumonia requiring admission in ICU, the most frequently responsible micro-organisms are mainly represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also by Legionella and Haemophilus. Pseudomonas aeruginona, anyway, cannot be excluded. The most recent Canadian and American guidelines for treatment of the above mentioned infections suggest the use of a combination therapy with beta-lactams (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam) and a new generation macrolide or respiratory fluoroquinolone. In case of allergy to beta-lactams, the association fluoroquinolone-clindamycin should be preferred. Whenever a Pseudomonas etiology is suspected because of the presence of risk factors such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, previous and/or frequent therapies with antibiotics and/or steroids, the same guidelines suggest the use of an anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam (such as piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems, cefepime) associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone (high doses ciprofloxacin). An anti-pseudomonas beta-lactam plus an aminoglycoside or aminoglicosyde plus fluoroquinolone can be an alternative. Early onset Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and early onset Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) in patients without risk factors for multi-resistant etiological agents are generally sustained by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylocccus aureus e Gram negative enteric rods. These infections can be treated with one of the following antibiotics: ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin or ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) or ampicillin/sulbactam or ertapenem. Late onset VAP and HAP in patients with risk factors for multi-resistant, by contrast, should be treated with a combination therapy: in case of defined or suspected P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp etiology, it is required the use of an anti-pseudomonas cephalosporin or an anti-pseudomonas carbapenem or b-lactam + beta-lactamase inhibitor associated with an anti-pseudomonas fluoroquinolone or an aminoglicoside. The possible presence of MRSA or Legionella pneumophila suggests the use of anti-Gram positive antibiotics such as glycopeptides or linezolid. These quidelines confirm the role of ciprofloxacin combined with beta-lactams whenever P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESbL+), Acinetobacter sp. etiology is suspected.
TI  - Bacteremia in children at a regional hospital in Trinidad.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to provide a Trinidadian perspective on pediatric community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacteremia via the documentation of common etiologic agents, antimicrobial profiles of the isolated pathogens, and patient outcome. METHODS: This was a six-year retrospective study of children with bacteremia admitted to the pediatric wards of the San Fernando General Hospital, Trinidad. RESULTS: Seven hundred and four episodes of pediatric bacteremia were reviewed during the six-year study period. The predominant isolate was Staphylococcus aureus (23.9%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Enterobacter spp (11.1%). The remaining isolates each accounted for less than 10% of total isolates. The mortality rate was highest for P. aeruginosa (39.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.5%), and Escherichia coli (19.2%). Of the six cases due to Neisseria meningitidis, only two survived. The overall mortality rate for the study period was 15.1%, but varied considerably according to age. All deaths due to P. aeruginosa and E. coli occurred in neonates. Almost 90% and about half of all S. aureus were resistant to ampicillin and erythromycin, respectively; nineteen (11.3%) were methicillin-resistant. More than 95% of K. pneumoniae and more than 87% of Haemophilus influenzae were resistant to ampicillin. Group B streptococci were fully susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, but showed >90% and >70% resistance to tetracycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively. Of the 40 strains of S. pneumoniae isolated, 10.0% had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >or=4 microg/mL (resistance) and 12.5% had a MIC=2.0 microg/mL (intermediate resistance) to ceftriaxone, while 7.5% showed intermediate resistance (MIC between 0.12 and 1 microg/mL) and 25.0% showed resistance (MIC >or=2 microg/mL) to penicillin. CONCLUSION: The bacteremia rate was found to be 8.4% among hospitalized children suspected of having sepsis and from whom a blood culture was positive. Bacteremia was also associated with a high mortality rate of 15.1%. An unusually high level of bacteremia with Gram-negative enteric bacteria was seen, which might indicate cross infection and reflect a breakdown in infection control measures. Relatively high-level resistance of S. pneumoniae to penicillin and ceftriaxone was not seen, even though the overall prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics among other pathogens was relatively low. The drugs that showed the greatest efficacy were imipenem, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and the cephalosporins ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
TI  - Group B streptococcal bacteremia in non-pregnant adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An increasing incidence of group B streptococcus (GBS) infection in non-pregnant adults has been noted in recent years. To understand the incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of GBS bacteremia in non-pregnant adults, we conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary teaching hospital in Taiwan. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 94 non-pregnant adults (age >/=18 years) with GBS bacteremia hospitalized between January 2001 and December 2003. RESULTS: The incidence of GBS bacteremia increased from 0.16 cases/1000 admissions in 2001 to 0.30 cases/1000 admissions in 2003 (p=0.017, chi-squared test for trend). The mean age of patients was 64.7 +/- 1.39 years. At least 1 underlying systemic disease was found in 81% of patients, with the most frequent being malignancy (43.6%), diabetes mellitus (42.6%), and liver cirrhosis (16%). The 2 major clinical syndromes were primary bacteremia (34%) and soft tissue infection (31.9%). The overall mortality rate was 20.2%. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 2 most common concurrently isolated bloodstream pathogens. Polymicrobial bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and shock were independent risk factors for mortality in GBS bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence of GBS bacteremia is noteworthy, especially among patients with invasive infections. These infections are also responsible for substantial mortality in elderly patients with underlying diseases. Susceptibility testing indicated that penicillin G remains the drug of choice for GBS bacteremia.
TI  - Microbial pathogens of adult community-acquired pneumonia in Southern Estonia.
AB  - Prospective analysis of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in 209 inpatients (mean age 56.2+/-11.2 years) was performed at the Lung Hospital of Tartu University, Estonia. Majority of the patients (87.6%) had at least one significant modifying or risk factor and 30.6% had severe community-acquired pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis were the most frequent pathogens (22.0, 12.2, 11.4, and 10.2%, respectively). Combined etiology was detected in 17.2%. Gram-negative pathogens prevailed over gram-positives and were significantly more frequent in patients aged > or =60 years (p=0.002) as in those with underlying diseases (p=0.01). An age of > or =60 years and previous antibacterial therapy were significant risk factors for Klebsiella pneumoniae as a pathogen (p=0.005 and p=0.002, respectively). Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, erythromycin, and doxycycline was 79.5, 90.2, and 100%, respectively, whereas all penicillin-resistant isolates were cefuroxime- and ceftriaxone-susceptible. Klebsiella pneumoniae was 100, 88.5, 84.2, and 81.8% susceptible to ceftazidime, gentamicin, ampicillin-sulbactam, and ciprofloxacin, and Moraxella catarrhalis was 100, 100, 100, 93.8, and 93.3% susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam, cephalexin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin, respectively. In conclusion, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the major pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia in Southern Estonia. Although gram-negatives were more prevalent, the major pathogens were favorably susceptible without a noticeable cross-resistance. Nevertheless, improved surveillance studies are needed because of a pressure for the rise in antibiotic resistance in the society.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefditoren: antimicrobial efficacy against major respiratory pathogens from Asian countries.
AB  - In this study we evaluated the in vitro activities of cefditoren and 14 other comparator agents against 1025 isolates of major respiratory tract pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial isolates were collected from 11 Asian countries. The majority of S. pneumoniae isolates (98.8%) were susceptible to cefditoren. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) of S. pneumoniae were <or=0.06 microg/mL and 1 microg/mL, respectively. These values were 2-32-fold lower than those of the other cephalosporins. Activity against S. pneumoniae was observed irrespective of penicillin or macrolide resistance. Cefditoren was also active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (100% susceptible; MIC(90)=1 microg/mL), H. influenzae (100% susceptible; MIC(90)<or=0.016 microg/mL) and M. catarrhalis (MIC(90)=0.016 microg/mL). However, the cefditoren MIC(90) of K. pneumoniae reached only 64 microg/mL (81.4% susceptible), which may be due to the high incidence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Asian countries. Therefore, cefditoren should be considered as a therapeutic option for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in Asian countries.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in Shanghai, China: microbial etiology and implications for empirical therapy in a prospective study of 389 patients.
AB  - The aim of this multicenter study was to identify the causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Shanghai, China, and to determine their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. Pathogens obtained from 389 patients with documented CAP during 2001-2003 were identified by multiple diagnostic tools that included bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and specific immunological assays. Susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was tested by the broth microdilution method. A specific pathogen was identified in 39.8% (155/389) of the patients: Haemophilus influenzae (n=80), Klebsiella spp. (n=15), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=12), Staphylococcus aureus (n=6), Moraxella catarrhalis (n=1), other gram-negative organisms (n=9), and atypical pathogens that comprised Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=42), Chlamydia pneumoniae (n=17), and Legionella pneumophila (n=2). Most H. influenzae isolates were susceptible to ampicillin (88.3%), and all were susceptible to macrolides. Of the S. pneumoniae isolates, 75% (9/12) were susceptible to penicillin, while 25% (3/12) were intermediately susceptible. H. influenzae and atypical pathogens are among the most important pathogens of CAP. Ampicillin, cephalosporins, and the newer fluoroquinolones can be used as empirical therapy for CAP in the Shanghai area. The efficacy of monotherapy with newer macrolides for CAP caused by S. pneumoniae requires further evaluation.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients in Jordan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the causative organisms of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Jordanian patients requiring hospital admission. METHODS: A prospective study of both adults and children admitted to Princess Basma and Princess Rahma Teaching Hospitals in Irbid, Jordan with a diagnosis of CAP over a 6-month period from April to October 2002. RESULTS: A total of 35 adult patients were admitted with a mean age of 47 years, and 63 children with a mean age of 3 years. A pathogen was isolated from 25 (71%) adults, and from 17 (27%) children, and sputum cultures gave the best diagnostic yield. In adults Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common isolate (26%), followed by Chlamydia pneumoniae (23%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9%), and Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%) each. Seven of the 9 gram negative isolates were from patients with some co morbid illness. While in children, Chlamydia pneumoniae was the most common (14%), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3%) each. CONCLUSION: Streptococcus pneumoniae and atypical microorganisms are the most common cause of CAP in previously healthy adults; while in those with associated co morbid illness, gram negative organisms are the likely cause. In children, the overall detection rate of causative organisms was low with atypical microorganisms being the most common.
TI  - Septic pulmonary embolism in Korea: Microbiology, clinicoradiologic features, and treatment outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicoradiologic features, microbiologic data, primary sites of infection, and treatment results for patients with septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) in Korea. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 21 SPE patients including "definite" and "probable" cases. RESULTS: On CT scan, peripheral nodules were the most common lesions (89.0%), followed by non-nodular infiltrates (7.0%) and wedge-shaped peripheral lesions (3.2%). Cavitation and feeding vessel sign, more specific to SPE were identified in 10.4% and 6% of all the lesions, respectively. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed significant abnormalities in three of 13 patients with an additional finding of vegetation in only one of five patients when studied by transesophageal echocardiography. In 15 patients, primary sites of infection were found, and three causative organisms were isolated in 16: K. pneumoniae (8); S. aureus (6); and viridans streptococci (2). All patients received parenteral antimicrobial therapy with or without drainage of the extrapulmonary infection and 18 recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathogens of SPE may differ depending on the primary foci of infection, early diagnosis and prompt antimicrobial therapy with radiologic or surgical intervention can lead to a successful treatment outcome.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in the AIDS patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, microbiological pattern and prognostic factor of bacterial pneumonia in AIDS patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of AIDS patients from July 2001 to Dec 2002. METHODOLOGY: Adults AIDS patients on HAART drugs that develop acute fever, cough with bronchial breathing or lung crepitations had diagnostic evaluation that included chest x-ray, paired sputum microscopy, culture and sensitivity, paired blood culture and haematological profiles including CD4' cell count. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (22.6%), 9 males and 12 females developed community acquired pneumonia during this 16-month period. Pneumonia was confirmed in 9 patients (42.9%), presumed in 4 (19%) and probable in 8 (38%). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for 22% of the cases when immunity was less impaired. Staplhylococcus aureus accounted for another 22 % while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeraginosa and Escherichial coli were isolated in 11% each when immunity was severely compromised. Fifteen patients (71.4%) were successfully treated with routine antibiotics. Six cases (28.6%) died. All had anaemia, leucopoenia and low CD4 cell count. Four (66.7%) of this had positive bacterial culture with bacteremia in three of them. CONCLUSION: Bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected patients has similar presentation to that in the general population, Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacilli especially Klebsiella pneumoniae were seen in a good proportion of the cases. Outcome of treatment was poor in the presence of positive bacterial culture, anemia, leucopoenia and very low CD4+ lymphocytes.
TI  - Cellular and humoral systemic and mucosal immune responses stimulated in volunteers by an oral polybacterial immunomodulator "Dentavax".
AB  - The oral polybacterial immunomodulator Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates was created for immunoprophylaxis and therapy of oral mucosa and parodont inflammations. The stimulating effect of the preparation was evaluated in twelve volunteers immunized for 10 consecutive days. On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 49 after the last immunization peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte activation and PB phagocytic activity, were studied by flow cytometry. PB lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, rIL-2, LPS and D were evaluated radiometrically. The production of TNF-alpha in supernatants of in vitro stimulated lymphocytes and specific IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and saliva was determined by ELISA. Ultrastructural morphologic changes in T and B lymphocyte populations were also investigated. Although no significant changes in the levels of basic lymphocyte subsets were detected, the early/late (CD57+/CD57-) CD8 T effectors ratio was increased at the end of the studied period, as were the percentage of PHA-responding (CD69+) T cells and PB phagocytizing cells. The most prominent lymphoprolipherative responses were measured upon costimulation with LPS+D and PHA+D on day 21. Electron-microscopic studies demonstrated a significant effect of D on both T and B cell activity. TNF-alpha concentration increased progressively from day 7 till the end of the investigation. Maximal concentrations were observed after stimulation with D and LPS. An increased level of specific salivary and serum antibodies against the components of D was found, with highest levels between days 7 and 21. Specific secretory IgA predominated in saliva as compared to IgM and IgG. Our results demonstrate the stimulating effect of Dentavax on PB lymphocyte functional activity and the specific humoral systemic and mucosal immunity.
TI  - Incidence of acute respiratory infections in children 2 months to 5 years of age  in periurban communities in Karachi, Pakistan.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the incidence of acute respiratory infections and burden of respiratory pathogens in children aged two months to five years. METHODS: Four periurban communities in Karachi were selected for the study. The children, identified with fever and cough during community surveillance at regular intervals, were referred to especially established study clinics. These children were diagnosed to have "no pneumonia", "pneumonia" and "severe pneumonia" as per IMCI guidelines. To identify the causative organisms, children with pneumonia and severe pneumonia were investigated with oropharyngeal swabs and blood culture. RESULTS: Acute respiratory infection was seen in 5884 children during 1st February 2002 to 31st January 2003. Of these, 1097 children had pneumonia and severe pneumonia, with an incidence 440.3/1000 children per year for Acute Respiratory Infections and 82.1/1000 children per year for pneumonias. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from 10.9%, 3.7% and 8.5% of oropharyngeal swabs respectively. Extrapolating from the results of this study, the total number of cases of pneumonias in children aged less than five years in Pakistan is estimated to be 213,116 per year due to H. influenzae, and 71,864 per year due to S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Incidence of acute respiratory infections in children varies in different communities and is a common cause of morbidity.
TI  - A 12-case series of Penicillium marneffei pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillium marneffei, an endemic fungus in Southeast Asia and southern China, is the cause of opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients who may present with symptoms and signs of the lungs, and abnormal chest radiographs. However, only a few cases of pulmonary infection from this organism have been reported. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical manifestations of patients with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia diagnosed by sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid culture MATERIAL AND METHOD: Retrospective descriptive study of patients who were diagnosed with Penicillium marneffei pneumonia at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital from September 1999 to July 2004. RESULTS: Twelve patients (eight males, four females) were included with mean age of 36.1 years. Nine cases were HIV-infected. Their presenting symptoms included fever, cough, dyspnea and weight loss. Skin lesions, hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy were extrapulmonary signs. Chest radiographs revealed diffuse reticulonodular, diffuse reticular, localized alveolar, localized reticular infiltration, and cavitary lesion. The diagnosis was made by cultures from the sputum in five cases and BAL fluid in the others. Co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Strongyloides stercoralis were found. Most of them were treated by intravenous amphotericin B followed by oral itraconazole, or oral itraconazole. CONCLUSION: Penicillium marneffei pneumonia has non-specific clinical manifestations, it cannot be excluded from other infections and may have co-infections. Physicians should include this infection in their differential diagnosis especially in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - [Aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  - The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Leptin and host defense against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pneumonia in mice.
AB  - Leptin is a pleiotrophic protein mainly produced by adipocytes that has been implicated as a link between nutritional status and immune function. Severe bacterial infection is associated with elevated plasma levels of leptin. To determine the role of leptin in the host response to bacterial pneumonia leptin deficient ob/ob mice and normal wild-type (WT) mice were intranasally infected with different doses of the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae or the Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae. After infection with lower doses of either pathogen ob/ob mice displayed lower pulmonary levels of proinflammatory cytokines, in particular tumor necrosis factor-alpha and chemokines. However, after infection with a higher dose of S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae the lung concentrations of these inflammatory mediators did not differ between ob/ob and WT mice. In addition, the extent and severity of lung inflammation, as assessed by semi-quantitative histopathology scores, were similar in both mouse strains. Finally, leptin deficiency did not impact on the bacterial outgrowth in the lungs during either Gram-positive or Gram-negative pneumonia irrespective of the infective dose. These data suggest that although leptin may play a modest role in the regulation of inflammation during bacterial pneumonia, it does not contribute to host defense mechanisms that act to limit the outgrowth of S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae in the lower airways.
TI  - [A multicentre study on the pathogenic agents in 665 adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in cities of China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogenic causes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients in China, the relation of previous antibiotic use and the Pneumonia Patient Outcome Research Team (PORT) classification to microbial etiology, and the prevalence of drug resistance of common CAP bacteria. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 665 consecutive adult patients with CAP at 12 centers in 7 Chinese cities during one year. The etiology of pneumonia was considered if one of the following criteria was met: (1) valid sputum sample yielding one or more predominant strains; (2) blood cultures yielding a bacterial pathogen; (3) seroconversion, a > or = 4-fold increase or decrease titers of antibodies to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of respiratory tract isolates was determined using the agar dilution method. RESULTS: Pathogens were identified in 324/610 patients (53.1%) with valid serum samples and sputum cultures as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae (126, 20.7%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (63, 10.3%), Haemophilus influenzae (56, 9.2%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (40, 6.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (37, 6.1%), Legionella pneumophila (31, 5.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (23, 3.8%), Escherichia coli (10, 1.6%), Moraxella catarrhalis (8, 1.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6, 1.0%). Of 195 patients with a bacterial pathogen, an atypical pathogen was identified in 62 (10.2%) cases. The non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin, azithromycin, and moxifloxacin was 20.3%, 75.4% and 4.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens have important role in CAP, with Mycoplasma pneumoniae being the most common pathogen, and mixed infection of atypical pathogens with bacteria was found in 10.2% of the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the most important bacteria for CAP. More than 75.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae was resistant to macrolides and 20.3% was resistant to penicillin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against recent isolates of respiratory pathogens from Asian countries.
AB  - In vitro activities of tigecycline were compared with 15 other comparator agents  against recent clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens (623 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 105 Staphylococcus aureus, 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 84 Haemophilus influenzae isolates) collected from 11 Asian countries. All isolates of S. pneumoniae from Asian countries were susceptible to tigecycline regardless of penicillin susceptibility with MIC90 of <or=0.06 mg/L. Both methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline with very low MIC90 values (0.25 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively). Tigecycline was also active against K. pneumoniae (98.9% susceptible; MIC50, 1 mg/L; MIC90, 2 mg/L) including 10 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing isolates and H. influenzae (100% susceptible; MIC50 and MIC90, 0.12 mg/L) from Korea. Data confirmed that tigecycline has an excellent in vitro activity against drug-resistant clinical isolates of respiratory pathogens from Asian countries.
TI  - Effect of aspiration pneumonia-induced sepsis on post-burn cardiac inflammation and function in mice.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies have found that burn injury alters immune function, predisposing the subject to infectious complications. We developed a mouse model of burn injury complicated by either gram-positive or gram-negative infection and hypothesized that post-burn infection would exacerbate the myocardial cytokine responses and contractile dysfunction characteristic of either sepsis alone or burn alone. METHODS: Adult C57 BL6 mice were given burn injury over 40% of the total body surface area and conventional fluid resuscitation (lactated Ringer's solution, 4 mL/kg/% burn) followed on day 7 by intratracheal administration of 1 x 10(5) cfu of either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella pneumoniae or saline. Mice received fluid resuscitation (2 mL of lactated Ringer's intraperitoneally) again after bacterial challenge. Cardiomyocyte cytokine secretion and the contractile function of isolated hearts (Langendorff perfusion) were examined in vitro 24 h after bacterial challenge. RESULTS: Infectious challenge seven days after burn injury exaggerated the inflammatory cytokine responses over those observed with either burn alone or gram-positive or gram-negative infection alone (tumor necrosis factor-alpha: sham, 72 +/- 9 pg/mL; burn alone, 176 +/- 6 pg/mL, Klebsiella pneumoniae alone, 337 +/- 8 pg/mL; Streptococcus pneumoniae alone, 184 +/- 2 pg/mL; burn + Klebsiella, 476 +/- 14 pg/mL; burn + Streptococcus, 351 +/- 6 pg/mL). Myocardial contractile depression was evident in the burn alone, infection alone, and burn plus infection groups, regardless of the organism selected to produce pneumonia-related sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative or gram-positive infection exacerbated the myocardial inflammation seen with burn alone or infection alone. The availability of a mouse model of burn injury complicated by pneumonia-related sepsis will allow use of genetically engineered mice to examine further the mechanisms by which burn injury increases susceptibility to infection.
TI  - Factors affecting the bacteriology of deep neck infection: a retrospective study  of 128 patients.
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Broad-spectrum antibiotics are advocated for treating deep neck infection. Anaerobic coverage is necessary, especially in odontogenic cases. The presence of diabetes, infection of the parotid space and an obvious odontogenic source of infection can aid in determining the causative organisms. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to analyze the bacteriology in deep neck infections and identify the factors that influenced the causative pathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 212 patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections at the National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2003 were reviewed; 128 patients with bacterial isolation from their pus cultures were enrolled. RESULTS: The cultures of 46 patients (35.9%) were polymicrobial. Viridans Streptococcus was the most commonly isolated organism (38.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (32.0%) and Peptostreptococcus (17.2%). The most common organism in 44 diabetic patients was K. pneumoniae (54.5%), versus viridans streptococcus (48.8%) in 84 nondiabetic patients. In patients with dental sources of infections, the culture rate of anaerobes was 59.3%; in upper airway infections and other sources of infections they were 22.7% and 21.5%, respectively (Chi(2) test, p = 0.0008). The differences in age, sex, and climate did not show any significant changes in the common causative pathogens. Common pathogens in the infection of parapharyngeal, submandibular, and extended spaces were the same as viridans streptococcus, but in the parotid space K. pneumoniae was the most common pathogen.
TI  - Nosocomial blood stream infections in Imam Khomeini Hospital, Urmia, Islamic Republic of Iran, 1999-2001.
AB  - In a 2-year retrospective study, the database of the microbiology laboratory of the Imam Khomeini Hospital was reviewed to identify patients who had nosocomial bacteraemia between 1 May 1999 and 31 May 2001 and identify the pathogen responsible and its resisitance to antibiotics. Of 6492 patients in various wards, 593 (9.1%) had positive blood cultures; 85 of those (14.3%) had signs of potential skin contamination. Gram-positive cocci, including coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and other Gram-positive cocci, accounted for 42.3% of isolates. Gram-negative bacilli were responsible for another 42.3% of isolates; Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the predominant isolate. Patterns of drug resistance varied according to species of bacteria but were generally quite high.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - [Using antibiotics in case of influenza].
AB  - Acute respiratory bacterial infection is the most common complication of influenza and a leading cause for excess rate of outpatient visits, hospitalization, and death (pneumonia). Influenza promotes bacterial infection as stated by epidemiologic evidence of temporal association between outbreaks or peaks of both influenza and bacterial pneumonia. The bacteria involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus. However, Gram-negative rods, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerobes and methicillin resistant S. aureus may be involved in institutionalized elderly patients. Various studies confirm that antibiotics are over-prescribed in patients with influenza or influenza like illness, even in the absence of bacterial infection signs, and in patients without comorbidity. No data has proven the benefice of antibiotic prescription in influenza-infected patients without bacterial infection. Neuraminidase inhibitors may be of interest for the management of influenza infected patients, because they can decrease the risk of bacterial complications and the use of antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - Comparative study of bacteriology in recurrent tonsillitis among children and adults.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis and treatment of acute tonsillitis are one of the most common problems seen at an otorhinolaryngology clinic in both adult and paediatric populations. Much has been written about bacteriology of recurrent tonsillitis but it remains a controversial topic. Despite the fact that tonsillitis is so common, consensus seems to be lacking as to the main causative organism and the differences between children and adults. The tonsillar core bacteriology of 233 patients with recurrent tonsillitis who underwent tonsillectomy from January 2000 to June 2003 is presented. METHODS: The patient population was divided into two groups, namely: the paediatric group and the adult group. 132 patients, whose age was more than 12 years, were in the adult group. 101 patients aged between two and 12 years, were in the paediatric group. The bacteriology of the children and adults were tabulated according to their species, and were compared. RESULTS: 138 patients grew single pathogenic bacteria in their tonsillar core culture, 52 grew two different pathogenic bacteria, and the rest (43) grew normal bacterial flora. Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly-isolated bacterium and accounted for 40.9 percent of the total cultures isolated; its prevalence was the same in the adults and children. Beta-haemolytic Streptococcus was isolated in 23 percent of subjects, and was predominantly from group A (Streptococcus pyogens). Group A beta-haemolytic Streptococci was more prevalent in children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which rarely cause pathogenicity in tonsils, was cultured from nine (3.8 percent) of our study subjects. CONCLUSION: This study showed that Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic bacteria cultured both in adults and children. Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumonia, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter are more prevalent in adults. Haemophilus influenza and Streptococcus pyogens are more prevalent in children. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a rare causative organism in recurrent tonsillitis. Since the mechanism of activation of infection in recurrent tonsillitis is unknown, knowing the bacteriology does not help us to treat the disease. However, it may be a stepping stone to eventually understanding whether the bacteria play a role in reactivating recurrent infections. From previous and current studies, there is no relationship between bacteriology and recurrent infections.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - Neutropenia induced in outbred mice by a simplified low-dose cyclophosphamide regimen: characterization and applicability to diverse experimental models of infectious diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: For its low cost and ease of handling, the mouse remains the preferred experimental animal for preclinical tests. To avoid the interaction of the animal immune system, in vivo antibiotic pharmacodynamic studies often employ cyclophosphamide (CPM) to induce neutropenia. Although high doses (350-450 mg/kg) are still used and their effects on mouse leukocytes have been described, a lower dose (250 mg/kg) is widely preferred today, but the characteristics and applicability of this approach in outbred mice have not been determined. METHODS: Fifteen female ICR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 and 100 mg/kg of CPM on days 1 and 4, respectively. Blood samples (approximately 160 microL) were drawn from the retro-orbital sinus of each mouse on days 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11. Leukocytes were counted manually and the number of granulocytes was based on microscopic examination of Wright-stained smears. The impact of neutropenia induced by this method was then determined with a variety of pathogens in three different murine models of human infections: pneumonia (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus), meningoencephalitis (S. pneumoniae), and the thigh model (S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis). RESULTS: The basal count of leukocytes was within the normal range for outbred mice. On day 4, there was an 84% reduction in total white blood cells, and by day 5 the leukopenia reached its nadir (370 +/- 84 cells/mm3). Profound neutropenia (< or =10 neutrophils/mm3) was demonstrated at day 4 and persisted through days 5 and 6. Lymphocytes and monocytes had a 92% and 96% decline between days 1 and 5, respectively. Leukocytes recovered completely by day 11. Mice immunosupressed under this protocol displayed clinical and microbiological patterns of progressive and lethal infectious diseases after inoculation in different organs with diverse human pathogens. CONCLUSION: A CPM total dose of 250 mg/kg is sufficient to induce profound and sustained neutropenia (<10 neutrophils/mm3) at least during 3 days in outbred mice, is simpler than previously described methods, and allows successful induction of infection in a variety of experimental models.
TI  - Endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is considerable amount of debate in the literature regarding the microbial flora of normal, acutely infected, and chronically infected paranasal sinuses. Few studies have specifically looked at the microbial flora of healthy and infected sinus cavities after functional endoscopic sinus surgery. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four cultures were studied. All cultures were obtained using a standard technique. The nasal cavities were decongested and anesthetized, and nasal endoscopy was performed. When purulent secretions were identified, specimens of purulent secretions were obtained for incubation. Sensitivities were tested according to microorganisms identified. Empiric therapy generally consisted of afluoroquinolone, amoxicillin/clavulanate, or a later-generation cephalosporin, and adjustment in individual instances when appropriate. RESULTS: Twelve cultures showed no growth, 86 grew a single microorganism, and 35 grew two or more microorganisms for a total of 151 microorganisms identified. The most common microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms that were cultured <5% of the time included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Serratia liquefaciens, Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia, alcaligenes, Fusobacterium, Escherichia coli, diphtheroids, Acinetobacter species, Klebsiella species, skin flora, and mixed Gram-negative and Gram-positives. CONCLUSION: Endoscopically guided aerobic cultures in postsurgical patients with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis most commonly grew S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and pseudomonal species. These cultures altered antibiotic treatment management decisions in a significant number of cases regardless of patients' clinical characteristics or history of previous culture.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the Estonian experience.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive Gram-negative pathogens in Estonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) protocols. Despite the higher rate of Gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for Gram negative pathogens. The higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing strains was 23% among Klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among E. coli. The inclusion of invasive Gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (2003). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The bacterial strains isolated from 565 patients diagnosed as having urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 14 institutions in Japan were collected between August 2003 and July 2004. The susceptibilities of them to many kinds of antimicrobial agents were investigated. Of them, 701 strains were estimated as prophlogistic bacteria and used for the investigation. The strains consisted of 258 Gram-positive bacterial strains (36.8%) and 443 Gram-negative bacterial strains (63.2%). Against Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin (VCM) showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 2 microg/mL. Against Streptococcus agalactiae, ampicillin (ABPC), cefozopran (CZOP), imipenem (IPM), and clarithromycin (CAM) showed a strong activity and the MIC90 was 0.125 microg/mL or less. Against Enterococcus faecalis, VCM, ABPC, and IPM showed a strong antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of cephems to Escherichia coli was generally good, and especially CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) showed the strongest activity (MIC90: < or = 0.125 microg/mL). Quinolone resistant E. coli [MIC of ciprofloxacin (CPFX): > or =4 microg/mL] was detected at frequency of 15.7%, which was higher than that in the last year. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem (MEPM) showed the strongest activity and next, the antibacterial activity of CRMN and CZOP was good. The antibacterial activity of the other cephems, however, significantly decreased, compared with that evaluated in last year. Against Serratia marcescens, MEPM had the strongest antibacterial activity. Against Proteus mirabilis, MEPM and CRMN showed the strongest activity and prevented the growth of all strains with 0.125 microg/mL or less. Nest, cefmenoxime (CMX), ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), CPR, CZOP, and cefditoren (CDTR) showed a strong activity. The antibacterial activity of the drugs to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was generally low, and MIC90 of all the drugs was ranged from 32 to < or = 256 microg/mL except IPM and amikacin (AMK) having 16 microg/mL. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was relatively good (MIC50: 2 microg/mL).
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin simulating human serum and lung concentrations.
AB  - Fluoroquinolones are known to penetrate well into the infectious foci such as lung mucosa, epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages achieving higher target site concentrations than the corresponding serum levels. In order to integrate the in vitro antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, their bactericidal efficacy was assessed by simulating human serum and lung tissue concentrations using Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae as indicator organisms. The bacteria were exposed to fluctuating moxifloxacin and levofloxacin concentrations simulating the drug levels in serum, lung mucosa, epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages. The following parameters were deduced from the kill curves: area under the bactericidal kill curve normalized to the initial inoculum (AUBKC norm), the time needed to reduce the inoculum by 3 log(10) titers, and the initial bactericidal activity. In general, all these three parameters were for all the bacterial isolates having been exposed to moxifloxacin concentration dependent. In contrast, beyond a levofloxacin concentration of optimal bactericidal effect, higher drug concentrations did not further augment the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin. These data demonstrate that not all fluoroquinolones share the same pharmacodynamic targets needed to maximize their antibacterial effect.
TI  - Stroke-associated pneumonia: microbiological data and outcome.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia is a common complication after acute stroke. It affects the outcome adversely. However, data regarding microbiology of stroke-associated pneumonia and its effect on outcome is scarce. METHODS: Stroke-associated pneumonia was identified through chart review of all ICD-9 identified adult stroke patients admitted to our hospital over a period of four years (1998-2001). The demographical, laboratory, radiological, microbiological data and outcome of patients with stroke-associated pneumonia were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: 443 patients with stroke were admitted over the four-year period and 102 (23 percent) had stroke-associated pneumonia. Their ages range from 28 to 100 (mean 64+/-14) years. 69 (68 percent) were men. Median length of stay was nine days compared to four days for all stroke patients. 68 (67 percent) patients manifested pneumonia within 48 hours and 34 (33 percent) after 48 hours of admission. Yield of tracheal aspirate cultures was 38 percent and that of chest radiographs was 25 percent. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms (12 percent each) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 percent each). Patients with infiltrates on chest radiographs were more likely to have positive tracheal aspirate cultures (p-value is 0.003). 35 patients (34 percent) expired during hospital stay. Positive chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates were independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay (p-value is less than 0.005). CONCLUSION: Pneumonia is a common medical complication of stroke. It is associated with a high mortality and prolongs the hospital stay. The yield of chest radiographs and tracheal aspirates is low. However, these are independent predictors of prolonged hospital stay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are most common organisms in stroke-associated pneumonia.
TI  - A retrospective study of the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania.
AB  - A 31-year record-based retrospective study was carried out to determine the aetiology and temporal distribution of bovine clinical mastitis in smallholder dairy herds in the Dar es Salaam region of Tanzania over the period November 1971-December 2002. Laboratory information on 1964 quarter samples from 1365 cows in 281 smallholder dairy herds were retrieved, compiled and studied. Eighty-eight percent of the quarter samples were culture-positive and the predominant mastitis pathogens isolated were Staphylococcus aureus (25.7%), Streptococcus agalactiae (15.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.3%) and Escherichia coli (14.1%). Other isolates included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.5%), Streptococcus dysgalactiae (5.2%) and Streptococcus uberis (4.2%). Contagious mastitis pathogens were isolated from 45.6% of the culture-positive samples, whereas environmental and miscellaneous pathogens were isolated from 48.2% and 5.7%, respectively. Thirty percent of the miscellaneous mastitis pathogens were Candida species. The results demonstrate a steady increase in clinical Candida albicans mastitis. The prevalence of Candida albicans has increased from 1% in 1971 to 17.0% in November 2002. Conversely, despite some fluctuations, the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae remain above 10%. The possible risk factors for these observations are discussed.
TI  - Culture-proven bacterial keratitis in a Malaysian general hospital.
AB  - One hundred patients (101 eyes) with culture-proven bacterial keratitis were treated in the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor Bahru, over a 4-year period. The majority of patients was male (63%), Malay (60%), from the Johor Bahru district (62%) and aged between 41 to 50 years (20%). The ocular predisposing factors were ocular trauma (41 eyes), ocular surface disease (28 eyes) and contact lens wear (26 eyes). The corneal ulcers were mainly large (50.5%), central (59.4%) and colonized by Gram-negative bacteria (78.1%). The most frequently isolated microorganisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (67 eyes), Staphylococcus aureus (12 eyes), Acinetobacter baumanii (6 eyes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5 eyes), Corynebacterium sp. (3 eyes:) and Streptococcus pneumonliae (3 eyes). Twelve eyes (11.8%) had polymicrobial infection. A good visual outcome occurred in 52.5% of eyes analysed. Prognostic factors for visual outcome include presenting Snellen visual acuity, time to presentation after onset of ocular symptoms, ocular predisposing factor, corneal ulcer location and corneal ulcer size.
TI  - Acute bacterial meningitis in Qatar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the changes in the epidemiology, clinical and bacteriological profiles of bacterial meningitis in the era of the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)vaccine and pneumococcus resistance. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of children aged <12 years admitted to the Hamad Medical Corporation, Qatar between January 1998 through December 2002 with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. RESULTS: We described 64 patients with culture proven bacterial meningitis. In infants <3 months (n=29 [45%]), the most common organism was Group B Streptococcus (GBS) (20%). Children >3 months (n=35 [55%]); Hib (25%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (STP) (20%) were the most common organisms before introduction of Hib vaccination. A significant drop of Hib infections were noticed after introduction of the vaccine. Fever, neck stiffness, seizure, vomiting, and bulging fontanel were the most frequent presenting features. Group B Streptococcus were sensitive to ampicillin and cefotaxime with no resistance detected. Forty percent of STP isolates were resistant to penicillin and 12% were resistant to ceftriaxone. Fifty percent of Hib were resistant to ampicillin; while none of Hib were resistant to ceftriaxone. No case of Listeria monocytogenes meningitis was diagnosed. Morbidity was 28%, and one patient expired (2%) after Klebsiella pneumoniae meningitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was associated with the highest morbidity (62%) while Hib had zero morbidity in our patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial meningitis is a serious illness with a significant morbidity and mortality. Haemophilus influenzae type b infection decreased which indicated an effective vaccination. As there is 12% bacterial resistance of STP reported against ceftriaxone; We recommend Cefotaxime for infants <3 months while ceftriaxone plus vancomycin as empiric therapy for older patients with community acquired bacterial meningitis. A pneumococcal vaccination may further decrease the incidence of meningitis in our community. A continuos surveillance to detect changes in the microbiology of organisms causing bacterial meningitis or their sensitivity in our community is essential to update these recommendations.
TI  - Detection of diverse bacterial signatures in atherosclerotic lesions of patients  with coronary heart disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infection has been discussed as a potential etiologic factor in the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study analyzes molecular phylogenies to systematically explore the presence, frequency, and diversity of bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions in patients with CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated 16S rDNA signatures in atherosclerotic tissue obtained through catheter-based atherectomy of 38 patients with CHD, control material from postmortem patients (n=15), and heart-beating organ donors (n=11) using clone libraries, denaturating gradient gel analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Bacterial DNA was found in all CHD patients by conserved PCR but not in control material or in any of the normal/unaffected coronary arteries. Presence of bacteria in atherosclerotic lesions was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. A high overall bacterial diversity of >50 different species, among them Staphylococcus species, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus species, was demonstrated in >1500 clones from a combined library and confirmed by denaturating gradient gel analysis. Mean bacterial diversity in atheromas was high, with a score of 12.33+/-3.81 (range, 5 to 22). A specific PCR detected Chlamydia species in 51.5% of CHD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of a broad variety of molecular signatures in all CHD specimens suggests that diverse bacterial colonization may be more important than a single pathogen. Our observation does not allow us to conclude that bacteria are the causative agent in the etiopathogenesis of CHD. However, bacterial agents could have secondarily colonized atheromatous lesions and could act as an additional factor accelerating disease progression.
TI  - Spontaneous bilateral bacterial empyema in a patient with nephrotic syndrome.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM), a rare infectious complication among liver  cirrhosis patients, is characterized by infection in the presence of pleural effusion without evidence of pre-existing pneumonia. The prevalence of SBEM in cirrhotic patients with hydrothorax is about 13%. However, it has previously not been reported in medical literature in patients with nephrotic syndrome. The most common microorganism identified is Escherichia coli, followed by Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. We present a patient with a history of nephrotic syndrome caused by membranous nephropathy, who received steroids and cyclophosphamide. He developed bilateral SBEM due to Aeromonas hydrophila and E. coli, which were isolated from the left- and right-side pleural fluid, respectively. The detailed clinical course, treatment, and outcome are described.
TI  - Comparison of the effect of delayed entry into 2 different blood culture systems  (BACTEC 9240 and BacT/ALERT 3D) on culture positivity.
AB  - The effect of delayed entry (2-48 h) into BacTAlert 3D and BACTEC 9240 and the effect of 2 storage temperatures (22 degrees C vs 35 degrees C) on bacterial growth was evaluated. The delay in transportation of blood culture bottles stored at room temperature had no effect on the recovery rate for the first 12 h. Culture positivity was between 74.4% and 100% for different microorganisms at less than 24 h preincubation time. The positivity rate decreased significantly for Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae for more than 24 h of delay. Culture positivity was higher at 22 degrees C for all microorganisms especially for Enterococcus faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Effects of instrument, preincubation time, and temperature showed that the risk of culture negativity increased 1.5 times for BACTEC compared with BacTAlert 3D and increased 2.5 times for 35 degrees C compared with 22 degrees C. The negativity increased 5.5 times and 8.5 times at 24 and 48 h of delay respectively, compared with no delay.
TI  - Changes in pharyngeal aerobic microflora in oral breathers after palatal rapid expansion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate in oral breathing children the qualitative and quantitative effects on aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oropharyngeal microflora of respiratory function improved by rapid palatal expansion (RPE). METHODS: In an open clinical trial, we studied 50 oral breathers, aged 8 to 14 years and suffering from both maxillary constriction and posterior cross-bite. At baseline, patients were examined by a single otorhinolaryngologist (ENT), confirming nasal obstruction in all subjects by posterior rhino-manometric test. Patients were evaluated three times by oropharyngeal swabs:1) at baseline (T = 0); 2) after palatal spreading out (T = 1); and 3) at the end of RPE treatment (T = 2). With regard to the microbiological aspect, the most common and potentially pathogenic oral microrganisms (i.e. Streptococcus pyogenes, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus spp, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans) were specifically detected in proper culture plates, isolated colonies were identified by means of biochemical tests and counted by calibrated loop. The data were analyzed by means of the following tests: Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon's test. RESULTS: After the use of RME there was a statistically significant decrease of Staphylococcus aureus stock at CFU/mLat T1(P = 0.0005; Z = -3,455 by Wilcoxon Rank test) and T2 (P < 0.0001; Z = -4,512 by Wilcoxon Rank test) vs T0. No significant changes were found for the other examined microrganisms. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that RPE therapy in oral breathers may strongly reduce the pathogenic aerobic and facultatively anaerobic microflora in the oral pharynx after a normalization of the upper airways function, and may reduce the risk of respiratory infections.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Tigecycline: a review of preclinical and clinical studies of the first-in-class glycylcycline antibiotic.
AB  - Tigecycline is a novel glycylcycline antibacterial agent discovered and developed by Wyeth Research. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the agent for use in patients with complicated skin infections, skin-structure infections and intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline is currently under review by regulatory agencies worldwide. Global clinical trials are underway to further assess the efficacy of tigecycline for community- and hospital- acquired pneumonia. Because of the expanded broad spectrum of activity of tigecycline with proven utility against Gram-positive, Gram-negative, anaerobic and atypical pathogens in addition to resistant organisms of clinical importance--community- and hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases--this novel antibiotic has come into clinical use at a critical time and will be a welcome asset to the current armamentarium.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of different parts of Citrus aurantifolia (lime fruit) as used locally.
AB  - We investigated the potency of Citrus aurantifolia (Lime fruit), against pathogens, in the different forms in which this fruit plant is used locally (juice of the fruit, burnt rind of the fruit commonly known as "epa-ijebu" in the Yoruba dialect) and the oil obtained from steam distillation of the fruit. The antimicrobial activity of "epa-ijebu" in different solvents was also compared. The solvents include palm-wine (a local alcoholic drink tapped from palm trees), Seaman's Schnapps 40% alcoholic drink, water, ethanol and fermented water from 3 days soaked milled maize known as "ekan-ogi" or "omidun" in the Yoruba dialect. Antimicrobial activity was carried out by the agar well diffusion. The clinical isolates used included Anaerobic facultative bacteria, namely: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25213, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella flexnerii, Streptococcus faecalis, Citrobacter spp, Serratia spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, and Escherichia coli; Fungi such as Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans; and Anaerobes which includes Bacteroides spp, Porphyromonas spp, and Clostridium spp. Crude extracts of all solvents used varied in zones of inhibition. The anaerobes and the gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to all the extracts with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 32 mg/ml-128 g/ml. The activity against the fungi showed only the oil extract potent for A. niger, while Candida albicans was susceptible to all the extracts with MIC ranging from 256 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. The gram-negatives have MIC ranging from 64 mg/ml-512 mg/ml. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged between 32 mg/ml to 512 mg/ml depending on isolates and extracting solvent. The oil and palm-wine extract of "epa-ijebu" showed greater activity than the other extracts. The killing rate of the schnapps extract on S. aureus and E. coli was 1 and 3.5 hours respectively.
TI  - Biological activities of Schefflera leucantha.
AB  - This study investigated various biological activities of the ethanolic extract of dried ground leaves of Schefflera leucantha Viguier (Araliaceae). The extract possessed very low cytotoxicity to brine-shrimp with the LC(50) of 4,111.15 microg/ml; the significant antioxidant activity on DPPH with the EC(50) of 71.90 microg/ml; the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase with the IC(50) of 10.53 mg/ml using the dopachrome microplate-assay. The extract of 5-20 mg/ml range in the agar dilution assay were active against various pathogenic microbial (11 species, 11 strains), with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 5 mg/ml against Clostridium spp.; MIC=10 mg/ml against enteropathogens as Bacteroides spp., Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Lactobacillus spp., Peptococcus spp. and Streptococcus mutans; MIC=10 mg/ml against a pneumonia causing bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and a dermatopathogen as Propionibacterium acnes; MIC=20 mg/ml against dermatopathogens as Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus spp. and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. TLC fingerprints of the specific extracts from the leaf powder exhibited zones of steroids-terpenes and flavonoids. HPLC fingerprint of the flavonoid extract was performed.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - A prospective etiologic study of community-acquired pneumonia in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is complicated by the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance and the tendency to rely on empirical therapy. This study investigated the etiologic agents of adult CAP in Taiwan and the susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from these patients. METHODS: A collaborative group was established in the emergency department to conduct a prospective study of the etiology of adult CAP. The etiologic agent was determined by a combination of microscopic, culture, serologic and antigen detection methods. Pneumococcal susceptibility testing was performed to determine the extent of penicillin resistance. RESULTS: A total of 100 consecutive cases of mild to moderate adult CAP prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic were enrolled. The etiologic agent was determined in 72% of cases. The 5 most common causative pathogens were S. pneumoniae (26%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (20%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (13%), Haemophilus influenzae (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). Atypical pathogens accounted for 40% of CAP. Bacteremic pneumonia was diagnosed in 6.2% of cases. Co-infections with 2 or more pathogens were found in 16% of the cases. Among the 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 85% (17/20) were susceptible to penicillin, 3 (15%) were intermediate, and none were resistant to penicillin. CONCLUSION: S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae were the 3 leading causes of mild to moderate CAP in Taiwan. This study indicates that penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae play a very limited role in this condition in adults.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates from conjunctival swabs.
AB  - Conjunctivitis is the most common disease of conjunctiva which occurs by exogenous or endogenous source. Bacterial conjunctivitis is the most common type of this infection for which emperical treatment is started without knowing the etiological agents because prior cultures are generally not taken. We conducted this survey to study the etiological agents of conjunctivitis in a total of 6763 swabs obtained over a period of four years (2001 to 2004). The prevalence of bacterial conjunctivitis was found to be 20.4% with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus (87.2%) followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.7%) and gram negative rods (E.coli + Klebsiella spp. + Pseudomonas spp.) in 8.1% swabs. For S. aureus, amikacin showed maximum sensitivity (73.2%) while for S. pneumoniae, cefotaxime (90.6%) and cefazolin (89%) were found to be highly sensitive drugs. For gram negative rods, ceftazidime (74.1%) and cefotaxime (67%) were found to be preferred options. Thus it is concluded that bacterial conjunctivitis in our hospital is predominated by S. aureus. The bacterial isolates obtained from conjunctiva have not yet attained a high level of antibiotic resistance and hence averts the need to unnecessarily start new/latest generations of antibiotic eyedrops or antibiotic combination which may lead to acquisition of resistance by these bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of native and synthetic surfactant protein B peptides.
AB  - Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is secreted into the airspaces with surfactant phospholipids where it reduces surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at end expiration. SP-B is a member of the saposin-like family of proteins, several of which have antimicrobial properties. SP-B lyses negatively charged liposomes and was previously reported to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli in vitro; however, a separate study indicated that elevated levels of SP-B in the airspaces of transgenic mice did not confer resistance to infection. The goal of this study was to assess the antimicrobial properties of native SP-B and synthetic peptides derived from the native peptide. Native SP-B aggregated and killed clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and group B streptococcus by increasing membrane permeability; however, SP-B also lysed RBC, indicating that the membranolytic activity was not selective for bacteria. Both the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of native SP-B were inhibited by surfactant phospholipids, suggesting that endogenous SP-B may not play a significant role in alveolar host defense. Synthetic peptides derived from native SP-B were effective at killing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at low peptide concentrations (0.15-5.0 microM). The SP-B derivatives selectively lysed bacterial membranes and were more resistant to inhibition by phospholipids; furthermore, helix 1 (residues 7-22) retained significant antimicrobial activity in the presence of native surfactant. These results suggest that the role of endogenous SP-B in host defense may be limited; however, synthetic peptides derived from SP-B may be useful in the treatment of bacterial pneumonias.
TI  - Pharmacologic characteristics of prulifloxacin.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. After absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolized by esterases to ulifloxacin. The drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. In vitro, ulifloxacin is generally more active than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus, Providencia and Morganella spp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin- or oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are susceptible to ulifloxacin. In well-designed clinical trials, prulifloxacin showed good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin) and was generally well tolerated, demonstrating a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin. In conclusion, the in vitro inhibitory and bactericidal activities exhibited by ulifloxacin and the favorable characteristics shown by its prodrug (prulifloxacin) in clinical trials, particularly indicate this drug for the treatment of lung and urinary infections.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - Changing face of septicaemia and increasing drug resistance in blood isolates.
AB  - In a retrospective study conducted between January, 2000 and December 2000, 7157  adults and children were studied. Amongst these, 1071 patients had positive blood cultures. Of these, 575 (53.6%) cases were community acquired septicaemia and 486 (46.4%) cases had developed septicaemia of nosocomial origin. Gram negative aerobes accounted for 708 (66.1%) isolates. Amongst them, Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated (23%), followed by Escherichia coli (14%). Acinetobacter spp. emerged as the next common pathogen (9%), followed by Salmonella typhi (5.4%). Staphylococcus aureus (9%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (9%) were the most common gram positive isolates followed by Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). Antibiotic susceptibility of all these isolates was performed by the modified Stokes' method. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli showed alarmingly high resistance to all groups of antibiotics with 70-80% resistance to amoxicillin and cephalexin. Minimum resistance was observed against cefotaxime (23%) and ciprofloxacin (12%). Majority of Enterococcus faecalis were multidrug resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae exhibited 26% resistance to penicillin. Thus, the study clearly highlights the rising level of drug resistance amongst the bacterial isolates from blood and hence the need to update and formulate newer drug policies.
TI  - A study of the role of multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonatal sepsis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimal number of blood cultures needed to document sepsis in an  ill neonate has undergone little critical evaluation. Multiple site cultures may improve pathogen detection if intermittent bacteremia occurs, or if a low density of bacteria is present in the blood. We hypothesized, however, that bacterial clearance is slower and bacteremia more continuous in septic neonates, so that a single site blood culture should be sufficient to accurately document true septicemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine the need for multiple site blood cultures in the evaluation of neonates for sepsis. DESIGN/METHODS: Clinical data were prospectively collected for 216 neonates who had 269 pairs of blood cultures taken from two different peripheral sites for the evaluation of possible sepsis. A minimum of 1 ml of blood was obtained from the two peripheral sites within 15-30 min of each other. Based on prior retrospective data, we determined that 203 infants would need to have two site blood cultures to demonstrate a significant improvement in pathogen detection at an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20 (80%) power. RESULTS: A total of 186 culture pairs were taken for evaluation of early-onset sepsis in 186 neonates, while 83 pairs were drawn for evaluation of late-onset sepsis in 43 neonates. In all, 21 neonates from the late-onset group were evaluated more than once, and 12 neonates were evaluated for both early- and late-onset sepsis. In all, 20 (9.2%) of 216 neonates had 22 episodes of culture-proven sepsis at a median age of 18 days. All neonates with positive cultures had the same organism with a similar sensitivity pattern obtained from the two different peripheral sites. The other 196 study neonates had negative blood cultures from both sites. The single episode of early-onset sepsis was caused by Listeria monocytogenes, while all remaining episodes were late-onset with the following organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis (7), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (3), combined MRSA and Candida albicans (2), Candida albicans alone (2), late-onset Group B beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GBS) (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Enterococcus fecalis (1), Escherichia coli (1), and Serratia marcescens (1). Since no infant grew organisms from only one of the two sites, the data indicate that the diagnosis of sepsis would have been made correctly in all infants with a single site culture. CONCLUSIONS: Two site blood cultures for the initial evaluation of neonatal sepsis do not have a better yield in pathogen detection. Sepsis in neonates can be detected with no loss of accuracy with a single site blood culture with blood volume of>or=1 ml.
TI  - [Trend of antimicrobial drug-susceptibility of blood isolates at an oncological center (1998-2003)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the patterns of antimicrobial resistance organisms isolated in blood cultures from patients detected in a tertiary level of care, teaching oncological hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All strains obtained from blood cultures from 1998 to 2003 were included and processed using the Bactec and Microscan system to determinate isolates and susceptibility to antimicrobials. The percent difference (increase or decrease) was obtained by comparing the frequency of resistance at baseline and at the end of the study. RESULTS: A total of 2071 positive blood cultures were obtained; 59.7% of isolates were Gram negative bacteria, 35.7% Gram-positive bacteria and 4.6% were yeasts. E. coli was the most frequent isolated (18.6%), followed by. Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.7%) and Klebsiella spp (9%). Throughout the study the susceptibility of Gram negative bacteria was stable and over 88% for most of the antimicrobials tested (except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ciprofloxacin susceptibility for Escherichia coli stayed around 50%. Susceptibility to amikacin was higher than that to gentamicin. Staphylococcus aureus susceptibility for oxacillin was 96% and that for vancomycin 100%. S. epidermidis susceptibility for oxacillin was 14% and for vancomycin was 98.6%. No strains of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. All Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were penicillin susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The drug-resistance found in this hospital is the result of the control in the use of antimicrobials, the hospital nosocomial infection program and the use of drug combination in all patients with bacteremia.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - [Study of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of levofloxacin].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dosing regimens of levofloxacin. METHODS: The drug concentrations in serum and urine were assayed by HPLC method and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after intravenous infusion of a single dose of 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg levofloxacin to healthy volunteers. The in vitro activity MIC of levofloxacin against 823 clinical isolates were determined and compared with other antimicrobial agents. Based on the above results, the PK/PD parameters C(max)/MIC and AUC/MIC were calculated and the dosing regimens of levofloxacin were proposed for infections caused by different pathogens. RESULTS: The results of clinical pharmacokinetic study showed that the C(max) of levofloxacin was 3.4 mg/L +/- 0.8 mg/L, 4.8 mg/L +/- 1.4 mg/L and 7.6 mg/L +/- 1.1 mg/L respectively, AUC(0-infinity) was 14.4 mg.h/L +/- 2.5 mg.h/L, 21.9 mg.h/L +/- 4.5 mg.h/L and 38.3 mg.h/L +/- 4.9 mg.h/L respectively, T(1)/2 beta was 6.2 h +/- 0.4 h, 6.4 h +/- 0.9 h and 6.5 h +/- 0.6 h respectively, and 69% +/- 5%, 69% +/- 6%, and 65% +/- 4% of the doses were excreted in urine within 24 h after intravenous infusion of a single dose of levofloxacin 200 mg, 300 mg and 500 mg. The in vitro pharmacodynamic study showed that levofloxacin was highly active against Hemolytic streptococcus and Moraxella catarrhalis. It was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin nonsusceptible strains), Hemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Levofloxacin also had good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and K.pneumoniae. However, most of isolates of enterococcal spp. were resistant to levofloxacin. Above 50% of Escherichia coli isolates were resistant to levofloxacin. Based on the results of PK/PD parameters, the adequate dosing regimens of levofloxacin should be once daily 200 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of infections caused by M. catarrhalis. The regimen of 300 mg once daily could be effective for the treatment of infections caused by Hemolytic streptococcus. 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was expected to be effective for the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae. For treatment of respiratory tract infections and urinary tract infections caused by levofloxacin-susceptible organisms including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S.maltophilia, 500 mg once daily of levofloxacin was needed to obtain good clinical efficacy. But PK/PD parameters predicted that 500 mg daily of levofloxacin was not effective for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococci. CONCLUSION: The proposed dosing regimens of levofloxacin based on PK/PD concepts are expected to provide good efficacy in clinical practice.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in outpatient urinary isolates: final results from the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA).
AB  - The goal of the North American Urinary Tract Infection Collaborative Alliance (NAUTICA) study was to determine antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used agents for urinary tract infections against outpatient urinary isolates obtained in various geographic regions in the USA and Canada. Forty-one medical centres (30 from the USA and 11 from Canada) participated, with each centre submitting up to 50 consecutive outpatient midstream urine isolates. Isolates were identified to species level by the standard protocol of each laboratory. Susceptibility testing was determined using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) microdilution method. Resistance breakpoints used were those published by the NCCLS, including: ampicillin (resistant > or = 32 microg/mL), sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL), nitrofurantoin (resistant > or = 128 microg/mL), ciprofloxacin (resistant > or = 4 microg/mL) and levofloxacin (resistant > or = 8 microg/mL). Of the 1990 isolates collected, 75.1% (1494) were collected from the USA and 24.9% (496) were collected from Canada. The mean age of the patients was 48.3 years (range 1 month to 99 years), and 79.5% and 20.5% of isolates were obtained from women and men, respectively. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli (57.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.4%), Enterococcus spp. (6.6%), Proteus mirabilis (5.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.9%), Citrobacter spp. (2.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (1.9%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (1.3%), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (1.2%), Klebsiella spp. (1.2%), Enterobacter aerogenes (1.1%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (1.0%). Among all 1990 isolates, 45.9% were resistant to ampicillin, 20.4% to SMX/TMP, 14.3% to nitrofurantoin, 9.7% to ciprofloxacin and 8.1% to levofloxacin. Fluoroquinolone resistance was highest in patients > or = 65 years of age. For the 1142 E. coli isolates, resistance rates were: ampicillin 37.7%, SMX/TMP 21.3%, ciprofloxacin 5.5%, levofloxacin 5.1% and nitrofurantoin 1.1%. For all 1990 isolates and for the 1142 E. coli only, resistance rates were significantly higher in US compared with Canadian medical centres. This study reports higher rates of antibiotic resistance in US versus Canadian outpatient urinary isolates and demonstrates the continuing evolution of resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Pentadactylin: an antimicrobial peptide from the skin secretions of the South American bullfrog Leptodactylus pentadactylus.
AB  - Norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions were obtained from male specimens of the South American bullfrog, Leptodactylus pentadactylus and shown to contain two peptides that inhibited the growth of microorganisms. The primary structure of a previously undescribed peptide, termed pentadactylin, was established as Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Thr-Leu-Lys-Gly-Ala-Ala-Lys-Asn-Val-Val-Gly-Ser-Leu-Ala-Ser-Lys-V al-Met-Glu-Lys-Leu.NH2. The second peptide, which differs from pentadactylin by eight amino acid residues, is identical to fallaxin previously isolated from skin secretions of the Caribbean mountain chicken frog L. fallax. Pentadactylin inhibited the growth of reference strains of both Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus group B) but potencies were relatively low (MIC values in the range 25-200 microM). The peptide showed very low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LD50>400 microM).
TI  - Bloodstream infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood stream infection (BSI) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. This study aims to describe the clinical, microbiological characteristics and outcome of BSI in pediatric patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from all pediatric patients with positive blood cultures. We identified all isolates from these patients from January 2004 to December 2004 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and determined antimicrobial susceptibilities by MicroScan Walk Away 96 (Dade Behring Inc., West Sacramento, CA95691, USA). RESULTS: Two hundred and twenty pediatric patients had BSI, of whom 147 (67%) were males and 71 (32.2%) were from intensive care units (ICUs). Two hundred and ten (95.4%) had single blood culture isolate. One hundred and seventy-three (78.6%) of the isolates were Gram positive bacteria and included the following: Staphylococcus epidermidis (55.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%) of which 14% were methicillin resistant, Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) (4.5%), 40% of which were resistant to penicillin and Enterococcus faecalis (4%). Gram negative bacteria were 44 (20%) and included Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pneumoniae) (3.6% each). Three isolates (1.3%) were Candida glabrata. None of the Gram positive isolates were vancomycin resistant. Three K.pneumoniae and one Pseudomonas spp. isolates were multiresistant. One hundred and ninety-four (88%) of BSI isolates were hospital acquired. Fever was the most common presentation of pediatric patients (26%) with positive blood culture with no apparent focus of infection. Respiratory tract infections 26 (12%) were the next most common. We seen sepsis in (7.7%) children between 8 days and 6 months of age. Bone and joint infections, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal diseases, malignancy and surgical cases were other associated clinical diagnoses of BSI in pediatric patients. Patients with immuno- suppressive disorders with BSI had isolates such as Salmonella spp., S. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Overall mortality was 13 (6%) (p<0.005) and those patients had underlying serious medical conditions with associated risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial use. CONCLUSION: Bloodstream infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Risk factors for hospital acquired infection include: prematurity, prolonged hospitalization, ICU admission, indwelling catheterization, mechanical ventilation and prior antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Spectrum and antibiotic resistance of uropathogens isolated from hospital and community patients with urinary tract infections in two large hospitals in Kuwait.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spectrum of microbial etiology and antibiotic resistance pattern of the uropathogens that cause urinary tract infections in 2 large teaching hospitals in Kuwait over a period of 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Vitek identification card system was used to identify the uropathogens. Susceptibility of the isolates against 18 antibiotics was performed by the microbroth dilution method using the Vitek automated system. In addition, gram-positive bacteria were tested in parallel by the disk diffusion technique. RESULTS: The six overall most common isolates were: Escherichia coli, accounting for 47% of isolates in both hospitals, followed by Candida spp. (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.6%), Streptococcus agalactiae (GBS; 9.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (4.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.1%). Amikacin provided the widest coverage amongst all the antibiotics tested followed by ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam. For the gram-negatives, high resistance (26-63%) to the beta-lactam antibiotics was noted, especially to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin and cefuroxime. Resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was also high. None of the enterococci was resistant to the glycopeptides, but 38-60% of the Staphylococcus haemolyticus were resistant to vancomycin or teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: These data show the high level of antimicrobial resistance amongst the uropathogens causing urinary tract infection in the two hospitals studied.
TI  - Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.
AB  - Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevis FMC3, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 5, Corynebacterium xerosis UC 9165, Bacillus cereus EU, Bacillus megaterium NRS, Yersinia enterocolytica, Listeria monocytogenes scoot A, Bacillus megaterium EU, Bacillus megaterium DSM32, Klebsiella oxytocica, Staphylococcus aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis CCM 2067 and compared with well known antibacterial substances such as penicilline, ampicilline, amoxicillin-clavulanate and ceftriaxon. The LPO--100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 system was purposed as an effective agent against many of the diseases causing organisms in human and animals.
TI  - Leptin corrects host defense defects after acute starvation in murine pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - RATIONALE: Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that declines dramatically during fasting and plays a pivotal role in the neuroendocrine response to starvation. Previously, we employed leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice to identify an important role for leptin in the host defense against Klebsiella pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of fasting on the innate immune response against pneumococcal pneumonia and to determine the effects of maintaining circulating leptin levels on host defense in fasted mice. METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 48 h and given an intraperitoneal injection of saline or recombinant leptin (1 microg/g of body weight) twice daily for 48 h before bacterial challenge. Mice were challenged with 10(5) cfu of Streptococcus pneumoniae via the intranasal route. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Lung homogenate S. pneumoniae burden was nearly 20-fold greater in the fasted as compared with fed mice. The impairment in bacterial clearance observed in fasted animals was associated with reduced bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophil counts and interleukin-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 levels. Alveolar macrophages from fasted animals also exhibited defective phagocytosis and killing of S. pneumoniae and reduced calcium-ionophore-stimulated leukotriene B(4) synthesis in vitro. In contrast, the provision of exogenous leptin to fasted animals restored bacterial clearance, bronchoalveolar lavage levels of neutrophils and cytokines, alveolar macrophage bacterial killing, and leukotriene B(4) synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that reduced leptin levels substantially contribute to the suppression of pulmonary antibacterial host defense during starvation and that administration of this adipokine may be of therapeutic benefit clinically.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in the hospital setting: impact, trends, and infection control measures.
AB  - The growing threat posed by antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a major challenge for infectious disease practitioners and public health officials. In recent years, the prevalence of resistance among key bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus sp, has increased at an alarming rate. The impact of antimicrobial resistance is manifold and can ultimately lead to treatment failure and increased morbidity and mortality. To control the spread of resistance and subsequent impact, a multifaceted approach is warranted. Awareness and surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, and compliance with infection control techniques may help contain the emergence and spread of resistant organisms.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical wound infections in a tertiary care hospital in Turkey.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the spectrum of the pathogens cultured from surgical wound infections and assess their antimicrobial drug resistances. DESIGN: Laboratory-based retrospective study for the five year period. SETTING: A four hundred bed, tertiary-care university hospital in Turkey. RESULTS: Overall 621 pathogens were identified from January 1999 to January 2004. Of these isolates, 431 (69%) were gram-positive, 178 (29%) were gram-negative bacteria and also 12 (2%) were identified as Candida albicans. The most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (50%), followed by Escherichia coli (8%), Streptococcus pyogenes (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (6%), Enterococcus faecalis (4%), Enterobacter spp. (4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3%), Acinetobacter spp. (3%), Proteus spp. (3%), group B. B-haemolytic streptococci (2%), Candida albicans (2%), and Citrobacter spp. (1%). The rate of resistance to methicillin in staphylococci and multidrug resistance in S. aureus were 31% and 12%, respectively. There was no increase in resistance to methicillin by years. Piperacillin/tazobactam, sefoperazone/sulbactam, carbapenems, ofloxacin and amikacin were the most active agents against gram-negative isolates. The rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production in K. pneumoniae and E. coli strains were determined as 14%, and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is emerging as a major pathogen in surgical wound infections. We concluded that antimicrobial treatment of surgical wound infections should include empiric coverage for MRSA. The surveillance of resistance in pathogens causing surgical wound infections is necessary to promote the appropriate therapeutic choices for these infections.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2003)].
AB  - From October 2003 to September 2004, we collected the specimen from 399 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 12 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 474 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 469 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 76, Streptococcus pneumoniae 81, Haemophilus influenzae 84, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 56, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 24, etc. Of 76 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) were both 38 strains (50.0%). Against MSSA, imipenem had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.063 microg/mL. Against MRSA, vancomycin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/mL. Arbekacin also showed the potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125-0.5 microg/mL. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90:2 microg/ mL) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/mL. In contrast, there were high-resistant strains (MIC: 128 microg/mL or more) for cefaclor (11.1%), erythromycin (43.2%), and clindamycin (40.7%). Against H. influenzae, levofloxacin showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 83 of all the strains (98.8%) at 0.063 microg/mL. Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and its MIC90 was 2 microg/mL. The activity of CZOP also was preferable and its MIC90 was 4 microg/mL for the mucoid-type and 8 microg/mL for the non-mucoid type. CZOP was the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.125 microg/mL. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of them were 4 microg/mL or less. The approximately half the number (54.1%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for 46.1% and 30.6% of all the respiratory infection, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.6%) and H. influenzae (18.1%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.9%) and S. pneumoniae (14.9%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.6%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). The bacteria relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with cephems or macrolides were P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus was relatively frequently isolated from the patients treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of ceftriaxone against various clinical strains isolated  in 2004].
AB  - The susceptibility of clinical strains isolated from patients with infection to ceftriaxone (CTRX) and injectable beta-lactam antibiotics was determined in Japanese medical institutions in 2004. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the above antibiotics against clinical strains isolated in 2004 was compared with that against part of the clinical strains isolated about ten years ago (1994 - 1996). The antibacterial activity of CTRX against Streptococcus including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptocuccus pneumoniae was potent and there were no large differences between clinical strains isolated in 1994 - 1996 and those in 2004 in the antibacterial activity of CTRX. CTRX inhibited the growth of all the strains of Haemophilus influenzae including beta-lactamase-negative, ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains at 0.5 microg/mL or less and showed the potent antibacterial activity against these strains. In addition, since there are no large differences between strains isolated in the past and those isolated in 2004 in the antibacterial activity, CTRX is considered to be a useful antibiotic in the treatment of BLNAR infections which are increased by the causative organism of infections especially in the field of pediatrics in recent years. CTRX showed the excellent antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae but one of the 50 strains of E. coli tested was highly resistant. The antibacterial activity of CTRX against Neisseria gonorrhoeae was the most potent in all the antibiotics tested. These results indicate that CTRX shows excellent antimicrobial activity against fresh strains isolated from patients with infections. CTRX is thus useful as a therapeutic antimicrobial for the treating a variety of infections.
TI  - [Surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to panipenem between 2000 and 2003].
AB  - For the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP, Carbenin),  MICs of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including PAPM against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over Japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. In the first surveillance from June 2000 to March 2001, 1,356 isolates of 28 species were tested, 1,221 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the second surveillance from April 2001 to March 2002, and 1,403 isolates of the same 28 species were tested in the third surveillance from April 2002 to March 2003. No remarkable changes in the activity of PAPM were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. The activity of PAPM in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before Carbenin was launched. This result suggests that PAPM still maintains potent activity. In these surveillances spanning three years, the incidence rates of resistance in various species were as follows (2000.6-2001.3 --> 2001.4-2002.3 --> 2002.4-2003.3): methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (39.3% --> 43.9% --> 47.3%), penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (48.9% --> 44.2% --> 25.7%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 13.8% --> 26.3% --> 43.2%), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (0.9% --> 0% --> 1.4%), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 1.3% --> 3.1%), beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae (19.2% --> 8.9% --> 42.9%), beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR, 22.1% --> 30.7% --> 33.0%), and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.0% --> 4.4% --> 1.0%). PAPM showed the most potent activity among tested drugs against PRSP, whose incidence rate increased notably. BLNAR, whose incidence rates also increased, exhibited low susceptibility to all tested drugs and metallo-beta-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa also exhibited high resistance. The findings of this surveillance indicate that it is necessary to pay careful attention to the trends of resistant bacteria such as PRSP, BLNAR, and metallo-beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Study on treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the treatment strategy for ventriculitis associated with ventriculo peritoneal shunt for hydrocephalus. METHODS: For all of the patients suspected to have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) infections, the first step of treatment was removal of the "infected" shunts, then a ventricular drainage was placed in frontal horn of the ventricle, and at the same time CSF was obtained from the ventricle for bacterial culture and tests of bacterial sensitivities to antibiotics. After the shunt removal and before the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, 25-50 mg of vancomycin was administered intraventricularly daily. As soon as the result from bacterial cultures was obtained, antibiotics should be adjusted according to the sensitivity test result. By the time of the infections being controlled, appropriate treatments including reshunting would finally be given for hydrocephalus if necessary. RESULTS: Among 11 patients, 9 were infected with coagulase-negative Staphylococci or Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus, one of them with concomitant infection of aerobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacteriaceae aerogenesis, 1 patient with Streptococci, and another one with Mycobacterium stercoris bovis. The tests of drug sensitivity showed that cocci in infection of 9 patients were all sensitive to vancomycin, but only 1 of them sensitive to gentamycin. There were other sensitive antibiotics for streptococcus in 1 case and for bacillus in 2 patients. Practically vancomycin was effective for 8 of 11 patients, including one case of streptococcal infection. The duration for anti-infection treatment was in a range of 16-36 days. Finally, all of 11 patients survived from the shunt ventriculitis, and 9 of them had significant improvement in their neurological functions. CONCLUSION: (1)Intraventricular administration of proper antibiotics is a reliable and effective way to treat ventriculitis associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. (2)Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for ventriculitis, but other kind(s) of some antibiotics are necessary in a few patients in addition to or instead of vancomycin. (3)The effect of systemic use of antibiotics could not be defined in this series of patients, but this may be used as an adjunct in the practice. (4)There are many problems related to diagnosis and treatment of shunt ventriculitis that should be studied more extensively and deeply.
TI  - Prevalence of etiologic bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis at Phramongkutklao Hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there is an increasing trend of prescribing antibiotics that cover beta-lactamase-producing bacteria as the first line drug for sinusitis patients in Thailand This practice dose not only increases the treatment cost but might also induce resistance to antimicrobial agents. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the pathogenic bacteria in acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis as well as the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The maxillary aspiration fluid specimens of 52 acute and chronic sinusitis patients at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand during May 2002-May 2003, were collected. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed and the beta-lactamase activities of isolated bacteria were determined. RESULTS: Of 58 specimens, 44 (75.9%) and 14 (24.1%) specimens were collected from acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis patients, respectively. Of 44 specimens of acute maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Haemophilus influenzae (13, 29.5%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 9%), Streptococcus viridan (4, 9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4, 9%). 6 (13.6%) of them were beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Of 14 specimens of chronic maxillary sinusitis, the predominant isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3, 16.6%), Staphylococcus spp (3, 17.5%) and Streptococcus spp. (2, 11.6%). 1 (7.1%) Haemophilus influenza isolate from this group was beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The percentage of anaerobe was 8.9%, 23.3% for acute and chronic maxillary sinusitis, respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study was indicated that the common organisms in acute maxillary sinusitis were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridians which were similar to a previous study. But the authors found an increased prevalence of anaerobe bacteria in acute maxillary sinusitis and also found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, 21.4% Hemophilus influenzae less than the previous studies (which found beta-lactamase-producing bacteria around 50% to 70%). The authors found 23.3% anaerobe bacteria in the chronic maxillary sinusitis, less than the previous studies, and the authors also found 8.9% anaerobe in acute maxillary sinusitis.
TI  - [Bacterial flora and mycosis of the vagina in women with symptoms of vaginal inflammation].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the microbiological profile of vaginal flora in 30 women  with gynecologic problems and 20 pregnant women complaining about pathological symptoms {pruritus, burning, vaginal discharge}. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The discharge from posterior vaginal vault was examined microbiologically on the Columbia Agar with sheep blood, MacConkey and Sabourand cultures incubated of 48 hours in the temperature of 37 degrees C. RESULTS: Bacterial infections were detected in 33 cases (66%), 12 of these women (24%) lived in urban, 21 (42%) in rural environment. From bacteria isolated from the vagina, most often because at 14 women stepped out Streptococcus agalactiae, at 11 Enterococcus faecalis at 8 Escherichia coli. In 5 cases bacterial inflammation was caused by two kinds of bacterium. At two women stepped out both Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli. In single cases it was Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae. In all cases of inflammation mycosis was called out by from Candida albicans. One ascertained it at 14 among all given an examination women. Mixed inflammations called out both by mycosis and bacterial stepped out in 3 cases in age of 21-30. At two women it was Candida albicans and Streptococcus agalactiae, at one inflammation mycosis accompanied Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: The common reason of vaginitis are bacterial infections caused by Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, E coli. Both, place of living and women' s age influence the type of etiological factor.
TI  - Microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We undertook to evaluate the microbiology of acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis (AECS). METHODS: Repeated aspirations of maxillary sinus secretions by endoscopy were performed in 7 patients over a period of 125 to 242 days. RESULTS: Bacteria were recovered for all 22 aspirates, and the number of isolates was between 2 and 4. A total of 54 isolates were isolated: 16 aerobic and facultative bacteria and 38 anaerobic bacteria. The aerobic bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (7 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Moraxella catarrhalis (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). The anaerobic bacteria included pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp (19), Peptostreptococcus spp (9), Fusobacterium spp (8), and Propionibacterium acnes (2). A change in the types of isolates was noted in all consecutive cultures obtained from the same patients as different organisms emerged and previously isolated bacteria were no longer recovered. An increase in antimicrobial resistance was noted in 6 instances. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the microbial dynamics of AECS in which anaerobic and aerobic bacteria prevail, and highlights the importance of obtaining cultures from patients with AECS for guidance in selection of proper antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - Bacteria isolated from blood, stool and urine of typhoid patients in a developing country.
AB  - Blood, stool and urine samples were collected from 100 patients diagnosed as having typhoid in 5 hospitals in Akwa Ibom State and analyzed for the presence of Salmonella species and other bacteria. Of the 100 blood samples screened, 55 (55%) were positive with the Widal test and 39 (39%) were positive on blood culture. Thirteen (14.1%) out of 92 urine samples were positive for bacterial growth, while 22 (26.8%) of the stool cultures were positive out of the 82 samples screened. Those within the age range 11-20 years old were infected most frequently (33%), followed by the age range 21-30 (19%) and 41-50 (18%) years old. Those in the age range of 0-2 years old (4%) were least infected. Female subjects were more infected than males. The commonest organisms isolated from the blood samples were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella paratyphi and Salmonella typhi. S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, K. aerogenes, S. faecalis, Proteus mirabilis and P. aeruginosa were isolated from urine, while those isolated from stool were S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, Shigella sp, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae 01. The isolates were sensitive to peflacine, ceftazidine, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and chloramphenicol. These antibiotics are recommended as the drugs of choice in therapy. The results suggest the existence of symptomless carriers of enteric fever bacilli in the state. This is worrisome, since some of the S. typhi isolates exhibited multiple resistance to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Potency and spectrum trends for cefepime tested against 65746 clinical bacterial  isolates collected in North American medical centers: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (1998-2003).
AB  - We evaluated the antimicrobial spectrum and potency of cefepime and selected comparators agents against clinical bacterial strains collected in North America over a 6-year period (1998-2003). Isolates were consecutively collected from bloodstream (44%), respiratory tract (41%), urinary tract (6%), and skin/soft tissue (5%) infections in 48 medical centers. Isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods in a central laboratory. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci were excluded from the analysis. Imipenem (MIC90 = 1 microg/mL, 99.9% susceptible) was the most active compound tested against Enterobacteriaceae (22860 isolates tested) followed by cefepime (MIC90 = 0.25 microg/mL, 99.5% susceptible) > amikacin (99.4% susceptible) > ceftriaxone (95.6% susceptible) > aztreonam (95.1% susceptible). Among comparators, the lowest susceptibility rate for Enterobacteriaceae was observed with ciprofloxacin (92.8% susceptible). Imipenem was also the most active compound against ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli (99.3% and 100% susceptible, respectively), followed by amikacin (81.4% and 97.2% susceptible, respectively) and cefepime (92.5% and 93.8% susceptible, respectively). Cefepime activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85.2% susceptible) was similar to that of imipenem (86.9% susceptible). Against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, cefepime (MIC90 = 4 microg/mL, 100.0% susceptible) was 4-fold more active than ceftazidime (MIC90 = 16 microg/mL, 86.4% susceptible) and showed a higher susceptibility rate than ciprofloxacin (93.2% susceptible). Cefepime was the most active compound tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 1 microg/mL, 97.4% susceptible), ranked after gatifloxacin and levofloxacin (99.2% susceptible). The activity of cefepime remained stable during the study period evaluated with the susceptibility rates varying from 99.3% to 99.8% among the Enterobacteriaceae and 84.4% to 88.4% among P. aeruginosa isolates. In summary, cefepime has retained broad activity and spectrum against Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and Gram-positive cocci (except oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci) isolated from North American medical centers in the 1998-2003 period. Continued resistance surveillance is critical to monitor the effectiveness of widely used parenteral antimicrobial agents such as cefepime.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tigecycline tested against organisms causing community-acquired respiratory tract infection and nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Emerging antimicrobial resistance among respiratory tract pathogens has created a critical need for development of new antimicrobial agents that are not affected by the commonly occurring genetic resistance mechanisms. Tigecycline, a novel broad-spectrum parenteral glycylcycline, has been shown to be active against many of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical, and anaerobic organisms, including strains highly resistant to commonly prescribed antimicrobials and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating infections of skin and skin structures, and for intra-abdominal infections. In this study, tigecycline spectrum and potency were evaluated against a global collection of pathogens (2000-2004) recovered from community-acquired respiratory infections (7580 strains) or from hospitalized patients with pneumonia (3183 strains). Among community-acquired infections, the ranking pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (52.9%; 21% ampicillin-resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae (39.2%; 23.7% penicillin-nonsusceptible), and Moraxella catarrhalis (7.9%). Tigecycline displayed potent activity by inhibiting 100% of the 3 species at clinically achievable concentrations (2, 1, and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively). The 10 most prevalent pathogens producing 94.3% of pneumonias in hospitalized patients were Staphylococcus aureus (48.5% of strains; 49.4% oxacillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Klebsiella spp. (5.6%), S. pneumoniae (4.6%), Acinetobacter spp. (4.5%), Enterobacter spp. (4.0%), Escherichia coli (3.8%), Serratia marcescens (2.5%), Enterococcus spp. (2.3%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.8%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (1.1%). At a concentration of 4 microg/mL, tigecycline inhibited >96% of these pathogens (exception, P. aeruginosa). S. aureus was readily inhibited by tigecycline (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL, respectively) with all strains inhibited at < or =1 microg/mL. Streptococci recovered from hospitalized patients (beta-hemolytic and S. pneumoniae) were also very susceptible to tigecycline with the highest MIC being 0.12 microg/mL. All E. coli (including 13.3% with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase [ESBL] phenotype) were inhibited by < or =1 microg/mL, and all Klebsiella (25.8% ESBL phenotype) and Enterobacter spp. plus 97.0% of Serratia spp. were inhibited by < or =4 microg/mL. Tigecycline was also active against Acinetobacter spp. and S. maltophilia strains (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 microg/mL, respectively). Further clinical studies should consider the role that tigecycline may play in the therapy for severe respiratory tract infections, both of nosocomial and community origin.
TI  - Tigecycline activity tested against 26,474 bloodstream infection isolates: a collection from 6 continents.
AB  - The activity of tigecycline (formerly GAR936), a novel glycylcycline, was tested  against recent bloodstream infection (BSI) pathogen isolates from 6 continents. Frequency of clinical occurrence of these pathogens was determined and their antibiograms assessed using reference broth microdilution methods. A total of 26474 strains were tested for tigecycline susceptibility according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards) by the M7-A6 guidelines with interpretations from M100-S15 and the package insert. The rank order of pathogens was Staphylococcus aureus (33.1%), Escherichia coli (14.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13.5%), Enterococcus spp. (12.3%), Klebsiella spp. (5.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.2%), Enterobacter spp. (3.0%), beta-hemolytic streptococci (2.9%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (2.3%), and viridans group streptococci (1.4%). Tigecycline exhibited a broader spectrum of activity against BSI isolates when compared to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, aminoglycosides, and many beta-lactams (imipenem). Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens tested, including staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL), enterococci (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL), streptococci (MIC(90), < or =0.12 microg/mL), Escherichia coli (MIC90, 0.25 microg/mL), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 1 mmicrog/mL), and Enterobacter spp. (MIC(90), 2 mmicrog/mL), but showed limited inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 16 microg/mL) and indole-positive or indole-negative Proteae (MIC90, 4-8 microg/mL). In summary, tigecycline exhibited a wide spectrum of antimicrobial potency versus BSI isolates collected worldwide. Serious infections in nosocomial environments should benefit from tigecycline use among the investigational phase 3 agents focused toward resistant strains.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - The antibiotic treatment of severe community-acquired pneumonia admitted to the critical care unit.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonias (CAP) are still caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. Legionella and Chlamydia pneumoniae have been defined as important atypical pathogens causing CAP. Klebsiella causes CAP primarily in patients with chronic alcoholism or in chronic care facilities. Normal hosts do not present with "unusual pathogens'' e.g., Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The clinical severity of a bacterial pneumonia has important prognostic implications and predicts admission to intensive care units, duration of therapy, and complications. The factors that determine the severity of a CAP are less related to the pathogen than the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient as well as the patient's humoral immunity. Relatively avirulent pathogens may result in severe CAP in patients with diminished/absent splenic function or significant cardiopulmonary disease. A critical concept is to appreciate that the selection of antimicrobial therapy is not dependent on co-morbidities since the antimicrobial therapy is directed against the pathogen and not the co-morbidities. Therefore the treatment of CAP, whether moderate or severe is with the same antibiotic at the same dose. Many antibiotic regimens are equally efficacious in the treatment of CAP. The most cost effective optimal regimen covers both typical and atypical pathogens, e.g., levofloxacin, and is currently the preferred antibiotic approach to moderate or severe CAP in the CCU.
TI  - Etiology of community acquired pneumonia among adult patients requiring hospitalization in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has not been a comprehensive multi-center study investigating the microbial profile of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Taiwan. METHODS: A prospective study of adult CAP patients requiring hospitalization between December 2001 and April 2002 was carried out in 13 hospitals in Taiwan. Etiology was determined based on laboratory data from blood and sputum cultures plus serology from paired serum and urine antigen detection tests. RESULTS: Etiology was assigned to 99 (58.9%) of the 168 patients having the most complete data for etiology determination, with mixed infection in 21 (12.5%) patients. More than half (51.8%) of the patients were>60 years and 63.7% of the patients were males. The most common etiologic agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae (40, 23.8%), the majority (60%, 24 cases) of which was detected by positive urine antigen test. Other common agents included Mycoplasma pneumoniae (24, 14.3%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (12, 7.1%), Influenza A virus (11, 6.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8, 4.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8, 4.8%). The prevalence of S. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae was highest in patients>60 years (25/87, 28.7%), and<44 years (12/59, 19%), respectively; while K. pneumoniae comprised a larger proportion (4/22, 18%) in the 45-59 years group. CONCLUSIONS: S. pneumoniae was the most common etiology agent in adult patients hospitalized due to CAP in Taiwan and the spectrum of other major pathogens was similar to studies conducted elsewhere in the world. Empiric treatment recommendations developed in other parts of the world may be appropriately adapted for local use after taking into account local resistance profiles. Our data also support the recommendation that urine antigen test be added as an adjunct to adult CAP etiology diagnosis protocol.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against isolates from patients enrolled in phase 3 clinical trials of treatment for complicated skin and skin-structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 4913 baseline pathogens isolated from 1986 patients enrolled in 4 pivotal phase 3 clinical trials. The trials, which were conducted in 38 countries worldwide, involved patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens for each infection type, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria (MICs, < or =2 microg/mL for most pathogens). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. A few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and members of the tribe Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline than were other gram-negative pathogens. The susceptibility of the pathogens to tigecycline was similar for isolates obtained from patients enrolled in the studies of complicated skin and skin-structure infection or of complicated intra-abdominal infection. For most pathogens, the susceptibility to tigecycline was similar across all geographic regions. The excellent expanded broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline demonstrated in vitro against clinical isolates confirmed its potential utility for pathogens associated with complicated skin and skin-structure infections or complicated intra-abdominal infections.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Bulgaria--a synopsis from BulSTAR 2003.
AB  - We introduce Bulgarian Surveillance Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (BulSTAR) and make the first report on surveillance data for 2003. This longitudinal surveillance programme monitors the isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility of all clinically significant microorganisms isolated from blood cultures, cerebrospinal fluid, upper and lower respiratory tract, urine and wound samples in the participating microbiology laboratories. Twenty eight public, 45 hospital and 6 private laboratories from all 28 counties of the Republic of Bulgaria participated in BulSTAR 2003. The total number of isolates from monitored sources during the surveillance period was 98 929. Seven microorganisms represented 72% of all isolated bacteria in BulSTAR 2003: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus-Providencia-Morganella group, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Generally the resistance of clinically significant Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria in Bulgaria was estimated to be at a medium level when compared with many other surveillance sources worldwide. A unique 32-year experiment on the population by treating all severe infections with an ampicillin/gentamicin combination resulted in twofold higher levels of resistance to amynoglycosides compared with other countries worldwide. This is due to the extremely conservative treatment schemes used in the former socialist countries, based on national directives and cheap domestic production of gentamicin and ampicillin. The forthcoming introduction of a computer network and improvements in detecting mistakes are expected to increase the sensitivity and the significance of BulSTAR surveillance system - an indispensable tool in the combat against increasing worldwide antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Role of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump in determining susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor LBM415 (MIC range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however, on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Insertional inactivation of the H. influenzae acrB or tolC gene in strain NB65044 (Rd strain KW20) increased susceptibility to LBM415, confirming a role for the AcrAB-TolC pump in determining resistance. Consistent with this, sequencing of a PCR fragment generated with primers flanking the acrRA region from an LBM415-hypersusceptible H. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acrA. Inactivation of acrB or tolC in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to LBM415 (MIC of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. Examination of acrR, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. Supporting this, NB65044 acrR mutants selected by exposure to LBM415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to LBM415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in Hong Kong: 10-years' experience.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the etiology, clinical features and outcome of patients with bacterial meningitis from an urban Chinese city over a 10-years period. METHODS: We reviewed the files of all persons aged 15-years old or above diagnosed with community-acquired bacterial meningitis from a regional hospital. The clinical findings, relevant laboratory and imaging results as well as outcome were recorded in cases with microbiological evidence of meningitis. Neurosurgical and pediatric patients were excluded. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients between the ages of 15 and 86 years of age (mean 52 years) were identified of whom 18 (28%) died. The four most common causes were Mycobacteria tuberculosis (46%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Streptococcus suis (9%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%). Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae were rare pathogens. The annual incidence of community-acquired bacterial meningitis was 1.27/100,000 adults. Delay in treatment was associated with a poorer prognosis (p<0.001, OR=38.84, CI=7.33-205.80). CONCLUSION: The causative organisms found in this region of China differ from that reported from Europe and the US; tuberculous meningitis is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north India.
AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, India, over a period of 1 year from August 2003 to July 2004. Among the 567 qualifying samples, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), Escherichia coli (15.17%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated Gram-negative bacteria other than Citrobacter, Acinetobacter, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. Staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and Enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated Gram-positive bacteria other than other Streptococcus and Staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. Among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of Gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against Enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. However, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all Gram-negative isolates. For Gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against Staphylococcus spp. Combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for Gram-negative pathogens. Hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic properties of sulfonamide--derived Schiff's bases and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal Schiff's bases derived from sulfonamides, as well as their transition metal complexes incorporating cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) were synthesized, characterized and screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against six Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Shigella dysentriae) and four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureous and Streptococcus pyogenes) bacterial strains and for in-vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed Schiffs' bases. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study the in-vitro cytotoxic properties of these synthesized ligands and their complexes.
TI  - Deep neck infection in diabetic patients: comparison of clinical picture and outcomes with nondiabetic patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the difference in the clinical picture and outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients with deep neck infections. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who were diagnosed with deep neck infections and who received treatment at the Department of Otolaryngology of National Taiwan University Hospital between 1997 and 2002. One hundred eighty-five patients were included in our study. Fifty-six patients with diabetes mellitus were enrolled for further analysis (diabetic group) and compared with the other 129 patients without diabetes mellitus (nondiabetic group) in demography, etiology, bacteriology, treatment, duration of hospital stay, complications, and outcome. RESULTS: The parapharyngeal space was the space most commonly involved in both the diabetic (33.9%) and nondiabetic groups (40.3%). Odontogenic infections and upper airway infections were the 2 leading causes of deep neck infection in diabetic and nondiabetic groups. Streptococcus viridans is the most commonly isolated organism in the nondiabetic group (43.7%). However, the most common organism in the diabetic group was Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.1%). There were 89.3% of diabetic patients, versus 71.3% of nondiabetic patients, with abscess formation ( P = 0.0136). Surgical drainage was performed more frequently in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (86.0% versus 65.2%, P = 0.0142). In comparison with the nondiabetic group, the diabetic group tended to have older mean age (57.2 y versus 46.2 y, P = 0.0007), longer duration of hospital stay (19.7 days versus 10.2 days, P < 0.0001), more frequent complications (33.9% versus 8.5%, P < 0.0001), and more frequent tracheostomy or intubation (19.6% versus 6.2%, P = 0.0123). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes mellitus are susceptible to deep neck infection. We should pay more attention when dealing with deep neck infections in patients with diabetes mellitus because those patients tend to have complications more frequently and a longer duration of hospital stay. Empirical antibiotics should cover K. pneumoniae in patients with deep neck infection who have diabetes mellitus.
TI  - Etiologies and treatment outcomes in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand.
AB  - Local epidemiological data on the etiologies of in-patients who are hospitalized  with CAP is needed to develop guidelines for clinical practice. This study was conducted to determine the pattern of microorganisms causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adult patients admitted to Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand, between January 2001 and December 2002. Altogether, 254 patients (124 males, 130 females) averaging 56.4 (SD 19.8) years were included. Eighty-six of them (33.8%) presented with severe CAP on initial clinical presentation. The etiologies for the CAP cases were discovered by isolating the organisms from the blood, sputum, pleural fluid, and other sterile sites. Serology for Chlamydia pneunmoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed to diagnose current infection. The causative organisms were identified in 145 patients (57.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the commonest pathogen, identified in 11.4% of the cases, followed by Burkholderia pseudomallei (11.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.2%). The atypical pathogens, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, accounted for 8.7% and 3.9% of the isolates, respectively. Sixteen patients (6.3%) had dual infections; C. pneumoniae was the most frequent coinfecting pathogen. The average length of hospital stay was 12.9 (SD 14.0) days, with 27.9% staying more than 2 weeks. Overall, 83.9% of the patients improved with treatment, 10.2% did not improve and 5.9% died. The most common complications were acute respiratory failure (31.1%) and septic shock (20.9%). We conclude that initial antibiotic use should cover the atypical pathogens, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, in hospitalized CAP patients. B. pseudomallei is an endemic pathogen in Northeast Thailand, and should be considered in cases of severe CAP.
TI  - Prevalence and clinical features of Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia at Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand.
AB  - Between October 2000 and December 2002, a prospective study was conducted among hospitalized community acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients admitted to Srinagarind Hospital, Khon Kaen, Thailand. The diagnosis of Chlamydia pneumoniae infection was based on serologic testing. The prevalence of C. pneumoniae among patients hospitalized with CAP was 8.7%; 24 cases of 276 hospitalized CAP patients. The mean age was 42.7 (range, 17-79) years and the male to female ratio was 1:2.4. More than half (54.2%) of them were without underlying disease. The mean duration of symptoms prior to admission was 5.5 (SD 3.7) days. Leukocytosis was found in 62.5% of patients. Localized patchy alveolar infiltration was the most common radiographic finding, followed by bilateral interstitial infiltration. Over half (52.4%) of the patients had a non-productive cough. Gram-positive diplococci or no organisms predominated in cases where adequate sputum was obtained. Dual infection was found in 45.8% of cases, mostly with Streptococcus spp or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Four patients (16.7%) had an initial clinical presentation of severe CAP; 3 of 4 had a dual infection. Ten patients (41.7%) received macrolides or a macrolide plus a third generation beta-lactam at the beginning of management. Two patients (8.3%) did not improve clinically and were transferred home. The average hospital stay was 11 .5 (range, 1-45) days. Parapneumonic effusions complicated 20.8% of the cases. Other complications included acute respiratory failure (16.7%), shock (8.3%), hospital-acquired pneumonia (8.3%), and acute renal failure (4.2%). We concluded that C. pneumoniae caused a wide variation of clinical presentations ranging from mild disease to severe CAP. Co-infection with other bacterial pathogens was a common finding. Use of macrolides or new fluoroquinolones as part of an initial therapeutic regimen should be considered to cover this organism.
TI  - Biological activities of Ginkgo extracts.
AB  - The biological activity of methanolic the extracts of leaves, roots, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, ginkolide A, ginkgolide B, bilobalide and a commercial Ginkgo product (Tanakan) was assessed. Bioassays consisted of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens-induced potato tumor assay and a Kirby-Bauer microbial sensitivity assay with pure strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pyogenes. Methanolic extracts of leaves, leaf-derived callus, root-derived callus, bilobalide and Tanakan inhibited tumor formation significantly, but more weakly than the positive control, camptothecin. No activity against E. coli was detected, but extracts from both callus types inhibited the growth of K. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. pyogenes. All extracts and reference compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes. Leaf and root tissues contained the highest levels of ginkgolide A, as compared to the callus tissues; leaf tissue contained more of all three marker compounds than the callus tissues.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbation of severe-to-very severe COPD with azithromycin in patients vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Sixty-five consecutive eligible adult patients, who were treated as outpatients for stable severe-to-very severe COPD, were enrolled in the study. All of them received 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine intramuscularly. Patients were seen monthly, as well as whenever they had symptoms suggestive of an exacerbation, at our outpatient clinic. Eighteen out of 65 patients suffered from acute exacerbation (AECOPD). Three of these patients presented two episodes of AECOPD. Patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD received azithromycin 500 mg/day once daily for 3 days and a short course of oral prednisolone 25 mg/die. In 16 cases, a single species was isolated, while in the remaining 5 cases at least two species were recovered. Clinical cure or improvement at the end of therapy (3-5 days post-therapy) was reported in 17 episodes of AECOPD with no relapse at the late post-therapy (10-14 days after the completion of treatment). Bacteriologic eradication or presumptive eradication rates at the end of therapy were 86% (24 out of 28 isolates). Azithromycin eradicated all isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella spp. isolated at baseline. Eradication of Sta aureus occurred in 1 of 3 isolates whereas azithromycin was unable to eradicate Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. Our data seem to indicate that pneumococcal vaccination reduces the possibility that an AECOPD is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This finding allows the use of antibiotics such as azithromycin, which, otherwise, should be avoided because of resistances.
TI  - An antibacterial and antiviral peptide produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4V isolated from soya beans.
AB  - Enterococcus mundtii ST4V, isolated from soya beans, produces a 3950Da antibacterial peptide active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. The peptide also inactivated the herpes simplex viruses HSV-1 (strain F) and HSV-2 (strain G), a polio virus (PV3, strain Sabin) and a measles virus (strain MV/BRAZIL/001/91, an attenuated strain of MV). MV, HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 95.5%-99.9% inactivated by peptide ST4V at 400 microg/ml. Monkey kidney Vero cells were not inactivated, even at four times the level peptide ST4V displayed antiviral activity, indicating that the effect was not due to cytotoxicity. Complete inactivation or significant reduction in antimicrobial activity was observed after treatment of peptide ST4V with Proteinase K, pronase, pepsin and trypsin. No change in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, suggesting that peptide ST4V was not glycosylated. This is the first description of an antibacterial and antiviral peptide with such broad-spectrum of activity, produced by a lactic acid bacterium.
TI  - Recurrent Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess in a diabetic patient followed by Streptococcus bovis endocarditis--occult colon tumor plays an important role.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is the leading cause of liver abscess in diabetic patients  in Taiwan. We report the case of a diabetic patient with a history of four episodes of K. pneumoniae liver abscess within 3 years. The patient later developed Streptococcus bovis bacteremia originating from a colon tumor with complications of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and silent splenic abscess. Occult colon tumor may have played an important role in our case, with recurrent infection arising from colonizers of the gastrointestinal tract. As our case shows, the possible association between occult colon tumor and K. pneumoniae liver abscess in diabetic patients should be surveyed.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilites to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 11,475 clinical isolates obtained from 52 centers in 2002].
AB  - The susceptibilities of bacteria to fluoroquinolones (FQs), especially levofloxacin, and other antimicrobial agents were investigated using 11,475 clinical isolates collected in Japan during 2002. Methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, the family of Enterobactericeae, Haemophilus influenzae and Acinetobacter spp. exhibited stable and high susceptibilities to FQs. The rate of FQs-resistant MRSA was 80 approximately 90%, being markedly higher than that of FQs-resistant MSSA. The FQs-resistance rate of MRCNS was also higher than that of MSCNS, however, it was lower than that of MRSA. No FQs-resistant clinical isolates of Salmonella spp. were detected in any of the surveys. Thirteen of Escherichai coli 696 isolates, 8 of Klebsiella pneumoniae 630 isolates and 33 of Proteus mirabilis 373 isolates produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), furthermore 6 of 13 in E. coli, 1 of 8 in K. pneumoniae and 14 of 31 ESBL-producing isolates, and in P. mirabilis were FQs resistant. Attention should be focused in the future on the emergence of ESBL in relation to FQs resistance. The rate of FQs-resistant P. aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infection (UTI) was 40 approximately 60%, while 15 approximately 25% of isolates from respiratory tract infection (RTI) were resistant. IMP-1 type metallo beta-lactamase producing organisms were found in 49 of P. aeruginosa 1,095 isolates, 7 of S. marcescens 586 isolates and 4 of Acinetobacter spp. 474 isolates, respectively. Glycopeptide-resistant enterococci or S. aureus was not found.
TI  - Is a change in the vaginal flora associated with an increased risk of preterm birth?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if a change in the vaginal  flora was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, and to determine if metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks increased the risk of preterm birth. STUDY DESIGN: We compared cultures taken at 23 to 26 weeks of gestation with cultures taken at delivery from women enrolled in the Vaginal Infections and Preterm Birth study to analyze the association of changes in the vaginal flora with preterm birth. RESULTS: Metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.05-2.1) in an unadjusted model. A change to heavy growth of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae at delivery was found to be associated with preterm birth (OR 2.4, 95%CI 1.6-3.8). After controlling for race, parity, prepregnancy weight <100 pounds, smoking or drinking during pregnancy, Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, chlamydia, mycoplasmas, group B streptococcus, metronidazole therapy before 32 weeks, vaginal pH >5.0, and an increase in E coli or K pneumoniae , only prepregnancy weight <100 pounds (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.07, 95%CI 1.01-4.21) and increased E coli or K pneumoniae in the vagina at delivery (AOR 2.99, 95%CI 1.37-6.53) were found to be significantly associated with preterm birth. CONCLUSION: An increase in E coli or K pneumoniae in the vagina is an independent risk factor for preterm birth. Changes in the vaginal flora may explain the increased risk of preterm birth seen with vaginal clindamycin or oral metronidazole therapy.
TI  - Changing bacteriology of adult community-acquired lung abscess in Taiwan: Klebsiella pneumoniae versus anaerobes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most literature regarding lung abscess focuses on anaerobic bacterial lung abscess, and aerobic gram-negative bacillary infection is less frequently discussed. This study was conducted to investigate the bacteriology of community-acquired lung abscess and to improve the empirical therapeutic strategy for adults with community-acquired lung abscess. METHODS: We reviewed and analyzed data on 90 consecutive adult cases of bacteriologically confirmed community-acquired lung abscess treated during 1995-2003 at a tertiary university hospital in Taiwan. RESULTS: We found that a high proportion (21%) of cases of lung abscess were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, which differs from the findings of previous studies. Lung abscess due to K. pneumoniae was associated with underlying diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-18.4; P = .039) and negatively correlated with a time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of >30 days (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P = .008). A higher percentage of patients with K. pneumoniae lung abscess had concomitant bacteremia (OR, 9.4; 95% CI, 1.1-81.9; P = .032), delayed defervesence (OR, 9.2; 95% CI, 1.8-47.8; P = .004), and multiple cavities noted on radiographs (OR, 11.0; 95% CI, 1.3-94.9; P = .015), compared with patients with anaerobic bacterial lung abscess. The rate of nonsusceptibility to clindamycin and penicillin among anaerobes and Streptococcus milleri group isolates increased. CONCLUSION: K. pneumoniae has become a more common cause of lung abscess than before, and a high proportion of anaerobes and S. milleri strains have become resistant to penicillin and clindamycin. A beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor or second- or third-generation cephalosporin with clindamycin or metronidazole is suggested as empirical antibiotic therapy for community-acquired lung abscess.
TI  - Breast milk as a source of late onset neonatal sepsis.
AB  - Neonatal sepsis can be a life-threatening complication in preterm neonates. We present the clinical course of 3 preterm neonates, 1 with recurrent sepsis and 2 with late onset sepsis attributed to ingestion of breast milk containing pathogenic organisms. Breast milk should be considered as a potential source of infection in neonates with recurrent infections or when infections occur simultaneously in siblings.
TI  - [Nosocomial bacteremia: epidemiology and current antimicrobial drugs resistances].
AB  - Nosocomial bacteremia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. A change is being observed in the distribution of its causative agents, as well as an increase in the resistances to some antimicrobial drugs. We have analyzed 600 significant bacteremia episodes during the year 2002, studying the resistances to antimicrobial drugs and some epidemiological aspects. Bacteremias caused by gram-positive were 57%, while the ones caused by gram-negative were 46.1%. The three microorganisms more frequently isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In S. aureus low resistance to oxacillin (10.3%) was observed. Streptococcus pneumoniae with lower sensitivity to penicillin was observed in 49.9%. Resistance of gram-positive microorganisms to vancomycin/teicoplanin was not observed. E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed low prevalence of expanded spectrum ss-lactamase strains. There are differences in epidemiology of bacteremias at regional level, and continuous local programs for monitoring resistances to antimicrobial drugs are needed.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of potential bacterial pathogens in adults with acute respiratory tract infections Prospective Epidemiological Network Investigating Community-acquired Infection SurveiLLance In Nagasaki (PENICILLIN) Study.
AB  - The prevalence and the antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacterial pathogens in acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURTIs) is not clear. We conducted a prospective community-based multicenter study in 45 centers across Nagasaki, Japan, between December 2001 and April 2002. We examined the nasopharyngeal or throat isolates in 930 adult outpatients with AURTIs. Potential bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes (from 6.8% patients), S. pneumoniae (5.3%), S. milleri group (2.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (26.0%), Moraxella catarrhalis (7.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (17.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.2%), were isolated from 51.8% of the patients. Penicillin nonsusceptible phenotype accounted for 44.9% of S. pneumoniae isolates. Among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 9.1% were methicillin-resistant. In H. influenzae isolates, 6.7% produced beta-lactamase and 23.2% were beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant. The results indicated that the potential bacterial pathogens were detected in the remarkable population of the adults with AURTIs and the current antimicrobial susceptibilities of such pathogens.
TI  - Cefdinir: an oral alternative to parenteral cephems.
AB  - Cost savings are possible if oral cephems of equivalent efficacy can be substituted for parenteral cephems. An in vitro study was performed to compare the activity of cefdinir, cefoxitin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against 243 clinical isolates of human pathogens. Activities were determined by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards microbroth dilution methodology using an inoculum of approximately 5 x 10(5) CFU/mL. Cefdinir was the single or equally most potent agent against Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that produced a variety of beta-lactamase types. Cefdinir was less potent than ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime against Haemophilus influenzae, but was 2- to 8-fold more potent than cefoxitin and 8- to 32-fold more potent than cefazolin. Cefdinir was slightly less potent than ceftazidime, against beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella catarrhalis. These data support clinical consideration of cefdinir as an alternative to parenteral cephems in infections where adequate tissue levels can be safely assured.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its  3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the diethyl ether, acetone, chloroform, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its 3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent have been investigated against some microorganisms. At least one of the extracts or 3-hydroxyphysodic acid showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. No antifungal activity of the extracts has been observed against ten filamentous fungi.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of UTIs during two different time periods (from February 1999 to March 2000, and from April 2000 to September 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. The frequency of occurrence of ESBL--producing Gram-negative rods increased during second period study. The isolated ESBL--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol Gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms. Isolated organisms from urine samples included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus penneri, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundi, Serratia spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, Enterococcus spp. Streptococcus spp, and Candida spp. Enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. Only 9.4% of isolated Enterococcus spp. were high-level aminoglicoside resistant (HLAR) strains. No vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. were isolated. Among coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) methicillin resistant strains (MRCNS) were isolated in 43.3%.
TI  - Statistical assessment of a laboratory method for growing biofilms.
AB  - Microbial biofilms have been grown in laboratories using a variety of different approaches. A laboratory biofilm reactor system, called the CDC biofilm reactor (CBR) system, has been devised for growing biofilms under moderate to high fluid shear stress. The reactor incorporates 24 removable biofilm growth surfaces (coupons) for sampling and analysing the biofilm. Following preliminary experiments to verify the utility of the CBR system for growing biofilms of several clinically relevant organisms, a standard operating procedure for growing a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was created. This paper presents the results of a rigorous, intra-laboratory, statistical evaluation of the repeatability and ruggedness of that procedure as well as the results of the experiments with clinically relevant organisms. For the statistical evaluations, the outcome of interest was the density (c.f.u. cm(-2)) of viable P. aeruginosa. Replicate experiments were conducted to assess the repeatability of the log density outcome. The mean P. aeruginosa log10 density was 7.1, independent of the coupon position within the reactor. The repeatability standard deviation of the log density based on one coupon per experiment was 0.59. Analysis of variance showed that the variability of the log density was 53 % attributable to within-experiment sources and 47 % attributable to between-experiments sources. The ruggedness evaluation applied response-surface design and regression analysis techniques, similar to those often used for sensitivity analyses in other fields of science and engineering. This approach provided a quantitative description of ruggedness; specifically, the amount the log density was altered by small adjustments to four key operational factors--time allowed for initial surface colonization, temperature, nutrient concentration, and fluid shear stress on the biofilm. The small size of the regression coefficient associated with each operational factor showed that the method was rugged; that is, relatively insensitive to minor perturbations of the four factors. These results demonstrate that the CBR system is a reliable experimental tool for growing a standard biofilm in the laboratory and that it can be adapted to study several different micro-organisms.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral cephems against various clinically isolated strains and evaluation of efficacy based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics theory].
AB  - We compared the antimicrobial activity of commercially available oral cephem agents, cefaclor (CCL), cefroxadine (CXD), cefdinir (CFDN), cefixime (CFIX), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefteram (CFTM), cefcapene (CFPN), and cefditoren (CDTR), against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and ESBL-producing bacteria isolated from clinical materials in Kansai Medical University Hospital between 2002 and 2003. Based on the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) theory, we determined the concentration of each agent at which the time above MIC (TAM) value was 40% or more, and calculated the rate of efficacy against each type of bacteria. In S. pneumoniae strains, the MIC(50,80,90) values of CDTR were 0.25, 0.5, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, lower than those of the other agents, demonstrating the most potent antimicrobial activity. However, the efficacy rate for CDTR calculated based on the PK/PD theory was 58.5%. CFTM showed the highest efficacy rate (66.1%). In H. influenzae strains, the antimicrobial activity of CDTR was most potent, followed by that of CFTM and that of CFPN/CFIX. The MIC90 value of CDTR was lowest (0.25 microg/ml), followed by that of CFTM (0.5 microg/ml). The efficacy rate for CDTR was 100%. This result supports that CDTR frequently eradicates H. influenzae. In E. coli strains, the MIC90 values of the above agents, excluding CCL and CXD, ranged from 0.5 to 1 microg/ml. The antimicrobial activity of CFIX against K. pneumoniae was most potent, followed by that of CFDN/CPDX and that of CFTM. In ESBL-producing bacteria, most agents showed an MIC90 value of more than 4 microg/ml. In S. agalactiae and S. pyogenes strains, all of the agents showed satisfactory MIC values. In methi- cillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, CFDN and CXD showed a high efficacy rate, whereas the efficacy rates for the other agents were low. The frequent use of oral agents has increased the number of cephem-resistant bacteria. ESBL-producing bacteria become highly resistant, and the presence or absence of response can be readily evaluated. However, when a mutation of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) occurs, drug resistance is less marked. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the treatment response in many cases. In S. pneumoniae strains, the efficacy rates for all of the agents were low in the evaluation using the PK/PD theory, suggesting that a dose higher than the standard dose should be established. Thus, in the future, the efficacy should be evaluated based on the PK/PD theory, appropriate antimicrobial treatment should be administered, and the administration method that does not increase the number of resistant bacteria must be established.
TI  - Clinical effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin on hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The effect of intravenous ciprofloxacin (CPFX) on hospital-acquired pneumonia was examined. The subjects were 32 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia classified as being in group I, group II, and group III, based on The Japanese Respiratory Society Guidelines for management of hospital-acquired pneumonia. None of the patients had received antibiotic treatment for the pneumonia. CPFX 300 mg was intravenously infused twice daily for 3-14 days, and its clinical effect, bacterological effect, and side effects were examined. Intravenous CPEX was clinically effective in 21 of the 32 patients, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. With regard to bacteriological efficacy, 4 of 5 strains of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 2 of 3 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 of 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 1 of 2 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 of 2 strains of Serratia marcescens, and the 1 strain of Klebsiella oxytoca were eradicated, with an eradication rate of 42.3% (11 of 26 strains whose fate was confirmed eradicated). Abnormal laboratory findings (side effects) were observed in 11 of the 32 patients (34.4%), but all side effects were mild. Based on the above data, intravenous CPFX may be the drug which should be recommended as the first choice for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. The sooner the diagnosis is established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. When the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. On the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. It is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. The AIM of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective study was carried out in the Paediatric Department of the Institute from January 1, 1978 to December 31, 2000. Patients originated from all parts of Yugoslavia. After the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. CSF was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. Diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by CSF culture; 2. elevation of CSF leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the Gram stain of CSF sediment. In 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Causes of meningitis were as follows: E. coli in 46 newborns (N) (26.5%), Streptococcus B haemolyticus group B in 35 N (20.2%), K. pneumoniae in 27 N (15.6%), K. oxytoca in 3 N (1.7%), Proteus spp in 14 N (8%), Salmonella spp in 12 N, Pseudomonas spp in 9 N, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 N, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 N, Enterobacter spp in 3 N, L. monocytogenes and Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus in 2 N each, and in one N. meningitidis, Streptococcus group D, Citrobacter, Morganella morganii and Alkaligenes xilosoxidans. Over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: E. coli (28.2%), SBHB (26.8%) and Klebsiella spp (11.3%). Over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: Klebsiella spp (26.8%), E. coli (19.2%), SBHB (14.1%), etc. In addition, new causes appeared, namely: Morganella morganii, Citrobacter, K. oxitoca and Alkaligenes xylosoxidans (Table 2). Of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died: of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (Table 1). Comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (Table 2). The explanation might be that the patients came to the Institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. The precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. Newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions where the intensive care units for newborns exist. CONCLUSION: The most frequent causes of meningitis are the following: E. coli, SBHB and Klebsiella pn. Frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. New uncommon causes have appeared. The mortality-rate remained very high.
TI  - Validation of a rapid diagnostic strategy for determination of significant bacterial counts in bronchoalveolar lavage samples.
AB  - CONTEXT: Bacterial cultures of bronchoscopic samples require 1 to 2 days for results to be available for use in clinical decisions. We developed a rapid diagnostic testing strategy that is highly sensitive for screening bacteria in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, with results available within hours of collection. OBJECTIVE: To validate the ability of a bacterial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assay and routine Gram stain microscopy to detect significant bacterial counts in BAL samples. DESIGN: Four hundred seventy-seven BAL samples from 319 patients suspected of having pneumonia were tested using a rapid diagnostic strategy, consisting of Gram stain and a bacterial ATP assay. Rapid results were compared with quantitative cultures with a positive cutoff of 10(4) CFU/mL or higher. RESULTS: Significant bacterial counts were identified in 107 samples (22%). The most common etiologic agents were Staphylococcus aureus (25%), Haemophilus influenzae (17%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%). The rapid test results were false negative in 5 cases (S aureus in 2, both Klebsiella pneumoniae and S aureus in 1, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and S pneumoniae in 1 case each). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the rapid diagnostic strategy were 95.3%, 54.9%, 37.9%, 97.6%, and 63.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: A negative result with this rapid diagnostic testing strategy rules out significant bacterial counts in BAL samples with a high degree of certainty and may allow use of narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents or withholding of empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients suspected of having ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - [Effect of delay of blood cultures on positive detection by automated blood culture system].
AB  - The effect of entry delayed blood culture bottles until the start of incubation for mechanical detection of organism were compared using 2 major blood culture systems; BACTEC 9240 system and BacT/ALERT 3D system. Total of 13 bacterial strains; 5 gram-positive cocci, 7 gram-negative bacilli and Candida parapsilosis which were isolated mainly from blood cultures were used as the test strains. BACTEC 92F, 93F and BacT/ALERT FA, FN bottles were used as the blood culture bottles. All the bottles inoculated with the test strains were incubated and evaluated immediately after standing at room temperature for 24, 42, 48, 54 or 72 hours, using the respective automated blood culture systems. All the bottles were subcultured. The effect of entry delay the blood culture bottles for the mechanical detection was observed in many gram-negative organisms in BACTEC 9240 system. The blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 4 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles inoculated with Escherichia coli. In Serratia marcescens, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5 of the 10 samples on delaying for 24 hours or in any of the samples on delaying for 42 hours in the BACTEC 92F bottles. In Klebsiella pneumoniae, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 9 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. In Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis, the blood cultures were evaluated not to be positive in 5-6 of the 10 samples on delaying for 42 hours. On the other hand, the blood cultures were evaluated to be positive in most of the samples of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (except 3 of the 10 samples which were evaluated not to be positive) on delaying for 42 hours in BacT/ALERT 3 D system. The samples except part of Streptococcus spp. were detected by subculture in both the bottles. These results indicate that the delayed time of blood culture bottles before inoculation with the test bacterial samples affects the positive detection of blood cultures markedly in the blood culture system. Therefore, the immediate incubation was considered to be necessary.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy in community-acquired pneumonia among emergency patients in a university hospital in Japan.
AB  - As antimicrobial therapy for pneumonia has not been well established in Japan, this study was designed to obtain a more definitive standard for antimicrobial treatment of this condition. Two hundred and thirty-one emergency patients admitted to Kyorin University Hospital between January 1998 and December 2000 were retrospectively analyzed in respect to their age, underlying disease, causative organism, and primary treatment with antimicrobial agent. Furthermore, the severity and prognosis were analyzed for those patients who had not responded to initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. The majority of the patients were elderly (over 65 years old; mean overall age 66.7 +/- 15.2 years) and had severe pneumonia; underlying diseases were recognized at a high rate in patients with severe pneumonia (P < 0.05) and in those classified as elderly (P < 0.0001). The most common underlying conditions in elderly patients were respiratory, cardiovascular (P < 0.01), and cerebrovascular (P < 0.05) diseases. The most common causative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. In patients with severe pneumonia, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified as the most common causative organisms. Complications associated with antimicrobial treatment were observed in those patients with K. pneumoniae isolates who also had severe pneumonia and were frequently treated with penicillin. Furthermore, increased mortality rates were observed in patients not responding well to the initial treatment with antimicrobial agents. Thus, the selection of appropriate initial antimicrobial agents is an important factor affecting the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Achillea clavennae essential oil against respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The essential oil of Achillea clavennae was investigated for its antibacterial activity against some respiratory tract pathogens. Maximum activity was observed against Klebsiella pneumoniae and penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil also exhibited strong activity against Gram (-) Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gram (+) Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant to the oil.
TI  - [Infectious spondylodiscitis in a health area of Galicia (Spain) from 1983-2003].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical-epidemiological characteristics of infectious spondylodiscitis (IS) in adults of our health area in the late 20 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of adult patients with a diagnosis of both, tuberculous (TS) and non tuberculous spondylodiscitis (NTS), between January 1983 and December 2003. The diagnosis was made when compatible clinical-radiological picture were present in association with at least two positive blood cultures and/or micro-organism recovery from vertebral samples. Additionally, TS was diagnosed when biopsy showed typical caseating granulomas from vertebral or extra-vertebral lesions. RESULTS: 17 TS and 22 NTS were identified. The mean age was lower in patients with TS than in NTS (43.5 +/- 24.6 vs 52.0 +/- 15.2 years; mean +/- SD). Patients were predominantly males in both, TS (57%) and NTS (82%; p < 0001). The time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was longer in TS (16.4 +/- 15.2 weeks) than in NTS (3.9 +/- 3.2 weeks), p= 0.005. Seven (41%) of the 17 patients with TS had active extra-vertebral tuberculosis. A source of infection was presumed in 20 NTS (90%), mainly surgical spinal procedures (9/22.41%). In three TS and four NTS one o more predisposing factors were observed. The patients with NTS presented a higher prevalence of fever (41 vs 24%; p= 0.0003) and leucocytosis (41 vs 12%; p < 0.001), but less neurological impairment (9 vs 21% p= 0,01). None patient with NTS presented mixed infection and Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen (14/22.64%) follows by Streptococcus sp (6/22.27%). Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were the remain causative agents. Spinal cord decompression and surgical drainage of abscess were performed in five patients (24%) with TS and four patients with NTS (18%), p= 0.0027). Neurological sequels were more common in the patients with TS (24 vs 14%, p= 0.008). The global incidence of IS was 2.2 cases/105 inhabitants/year, which 1.73 cases are NTS. CONCLUSIONS: The IS are a unusual disease what occurs predominantly in male patients. In the last 10 years, a increasing prevalence of NTS was observed, with high contribution (41%) of post-surgical cases. Diagnostic delay is greater in patients with TS and this condition was associated with more neurological sequels.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in 45 crows in Ueno Zoo and the in vitro susceptibilities of 29 Escherichia coli isolates to 14 antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Microorganisms from 45 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) captured from July to  December 2002 at Ueno Zoo, Tokyo were identified as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Pseudomonas maltophila, Staphylococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. E. coli showed the highest rate of isolation (21.6%). In an in vitro susceptibility test for 29 isolates of E. coli to 14 antimicrobial agents, all the isolates were resistant to penicillin G, vancomycin, erythromycin, lincomycin, bicozamycin, sulfadimethoxine, and olaquindox. Several isolates of them were also resistant to tetracycline, oxytetracycline, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Twenty-nine isolates were divided into 19 serogroups and the most frequently identified serogroups were O8, O114 and O144, which showed the same multidrug-resistant patterns.
TI  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia: assessment of microbial aetiology as mortality factor.
AB  - Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of mortality. The aetiology of CAP has rarely been identified as a mortality risk factor. A prospective study was conducted to assess the prognostic factors of CAP patients admitted to the intensive care unit (Centre Hospitalier Departmental Felix Guyon, St Denis de la Reunion, France), with a special emphasis on microbial aetiology. All variables assessing severity were collected, with a special emphasis on microbial investigations. Among 112 immunocompetent patients (mean+/-SD age 54.7+/-15.1 yrs), 84% were male. Severity of CAP was demonstrated by mortality rate (43%), shock (48%), simplified acute physiology score (SAPS; 46.4+/-21.6) and mechanical ventilation support (82%). Mean risk factor score was 2.2+/-1.2. Microbiological identification was obtained in 78.6% of cases, with positive blood culture in 33%. Most frequently, microbial agents were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae (42% and 22%, respectively). The univariate analysis recorded the usual mortality variables: age, alcohol consumption, SAPS, shock, mechanical ventilation, positive end expiratory pressure level, positive blood culture, multilobar infiltrates on chest radiograph, neutropenia, and acidosis, and found K. pneumoniae (versus S. pneumoniae, and all CAP) as a mortality factor. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that septic shock (relative risk (RR) 141), K. pneumoniae CAP (RR 27), SAPS (RR 10.7) and positive blood culture (RR 2.7) were independent factors related to death. In conclusion, the present study found that the microbial aetiology, Klebsiella pneumoniae, was an independent risk factor for mortality in severe community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in children].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefdinir against clinical isolates of respiratory tract pathogens in Children. METHODS: MIC values of cefdinir against 380 strains were determined with E-test method and compared with those of cefaclor. RESULTS: All penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) strains were also susceptible to cefdinir and cefaclor. Both cefdinir and cefaclor were not active against penicillin-resistant SP (PRSP). Against penicillin-intermediate SP (PISP) the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor were 70.1% and 57.4%, respectively. The activity of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases negative Hemophilus influenzae (HI) was excellent, but the susceptibility rates of cefdinir and cefaclor against beta-lactamases positive HI were 85.0% and 70.0%, respectively with MIC(90) of 1.5 mg/L vs. 256.0 mg/L. Cefdinir presented higher activities and lower MIC values than cefaclor against Moraxella catarrhalis (MC), Group A streptococcus (GAS), methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pn). Both cefdinir and cefaclor were not susceptible to ESBLs positive E. coli and K. pn. CONCLUSIONS: Cefdinir exhibits excellent activity against PSSP, PISP, HI, as well as MC, GAS, MSSA and ESBLs negative E. coli or K. pn.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem against selected respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of ertapenem was evaluated in comparison to 21  selected agents against a large collection of recently isolated respiratory tract pathogens including: 180 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 Streptococcus pyogenes, 70 Haemophilus influenzae, 70 Moraxella catarrhalis, 100 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 30 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additional in vitro tests (time-kill curves with ertapenem alone and in combination with four other agents) for S. pneumoniae were carried out. METHODS: MIC determinations and time-kill curves were carried out following the procedures suggested by the NCCLS. RESULTS: According to NCCLS susceptibility breakpoints, ertapenem was comparable to the most potent compounds tested for all pathogens studied. Ertapenem was 100% active against penicillin-susceptible and -intermediate S. pneumoniae and against 60% of penicillin-resistant strains. Time-kill tests at 4x MIC confirmed a pronounced bactericidal potency of ertapenem against these organisms. Interactions of ertapenem with several other agents against pneumococci resulted in clear synergic interactions (98.4%). Indifference was extremely rare and antagonism was not observed. All S. pyogenes strains tested were inhibited by ertapenem, irrespective of their macrolide resistance phenotypes. Ertapenem was also fully active against H. influenzae (100% susceptible) and M. catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-0.03 mg/L) even when capable of synthesizing beta-lactamases. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, were 100% susceptible to ertapenem. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that ertapenem has a suitable spectrum of activity against organisms encountered in community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Prulifloxacin.
AB  - Prulifloxacin, the prodrug of ulifloxacin, is a broad-spectrum oral fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent. After absorption, prulifloxacin is metabolised by esterases to ulifloxacin. The drug has a long elimination half-life, allowing once-daily administration. Ulifloxacin is generally more active in vitro than other fluoroquinolones against a variety of clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacteria, including community and nosocomial isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus, Providencia and Morganella spp., Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus spp. The activity of ulifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa varies between countries. Gram-positive organisms, including meticillin- or oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Italian community isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae are susceptible to ulifloxacin. Activity against Spanish strains of S. pneumoniae is moderate. In well designed clinical trials, good clinical and bacteriological efficacy (similar to that of ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pefloxacin) was seen with prulifloxacin 600 mg once daily for 10 days in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or complicated lower urinary tract infections (UTIs), and with single-dose prulifloxacin 600 mg in acute, uncomplicated lower UTIs. Prulifloxacin was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with a similar tolerability profile to that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - LPS-binding protein-deficient mice have an impaired defense against Gram-negative but not Gram-positive pneumonia.
AB  - LPS-binding protein (LBP) can facilitate the transfer of cell wall components of  both Gram-negative bacteria (LPS) and Gram-positive bacteria (lipoteichoic acid) to inflammatory cells. Although LBP is predominantly produced in the liver, recent studies have indicated that this protein is also synthesized locally in the lung by epithelial cells. To determine the role of LBP in the immune response to pneumonia, LBP gene-deficient (-/-) and normal wild-type (WT) mice were intra-nasally infected with either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella pneumoniae, common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, respectively. Pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with a 7-fold rise in LBP concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of WT mice; LBP-/- mice infected with S. pneumoniae showed a similar survival and a similar bacterial burden in their lungs 48 h post-infection. In Klebsiella pneumonia, however, LBP-/- mice demonstrated a diminished survival together with an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs. These data suggest that LBP is important for a protective immune response in Klebsiella pneumonia, but does not contribute to an effective host response in pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - Deep neck infection: analysis of 185 cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study reviews our experience with deep neck infections and tries to identify the predisposing factors of life-threatening complications. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients who were diagnosed as having deep neck infections in the Department of Otolaryngology at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1997 to 2002. Their demographics etiology, associated systemic diseases, bacteriology, radiology, treatment, duration of hospitalization, complications, and outcomes were reviewed. The attributing factors to deep neck infections, such as the age and systemic diseases of patients, were also analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five charts were recorded; 109 (58.9%) were men, and 76 (41.1%) were women, with a mean age of 49.5 +/- 20.5 years. Ninety-seven (52.4%) of the patients were older than 50 years old. There were 63 patients (34.1%) who had associated systemic diseases, with 88.9% (56/63) of those having diabetes mellitus (DM). The parapharyngeal space (38.4%) was the most commonly involved space. Odontogenic infections and upper airway infections were the two most common causes of deep neck infections (53.2% and 30.5% of the known causes). Streptococcus viridans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common organisms (33.9%, 33.9%) identified through pus cultures. K. pneumoniae was also the most common infective organism (56.1%) in patients with DM. Of the abscess group (142 patients), 103 patients (72.5%) underwent surgical drainages. Thirty patients (16.2%) had major complications during admission, and among them, 18 patients received tracheostomies. Those patients with underlying systemic diseases or complications or who received tracheostomy tended to have a longer hospital stay and were older. There were three deaths (mortality rate, 1.6%). All had an underlying systemic disease and were older than 72 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: When dealing with deep neck infections in a high-risk group (older patients with DM or other underlying systemic diseases) in the clinic, more attention should be paid to the prevention of complications and even the possibility of death. Early surgical drainage remains the main method of treating deep neck abscesses. Therapeutic needle aspiration and conservative medical treatment are effective in selective cases such as those with minimal abscess formation.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2002)].
AB  - From October 2002 to September 2003, we collected the specimen from 476 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and patients' characteristics. Of 584 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 578 strains were examined. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 77, Streptococcus pneumoniae 103, Haemophilus influenzae 95, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 61, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 23, Klebsiella pneumoniae 36, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 29, etc. Of 77 S. aureus strains, those with 2 microg/ml or less of MIC of oxacillin (MPIPC) [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus: MSSA] was 34 strains (44.2%) and those with 4 microg/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) was 43 strains (55.8%). Against MSSA, imipenem (IPM) and minocycline (MINO) had the most potent antibacterial activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25 microg/ml. Although clindamycin (CLDM) and aminoglycosides also had the potent activity, the resistant strains against those agents were detected. Cefotiam (CTM) inhibited the growth of all the strains at 1 microg/ml without the low sensitive strains. Against MRSA, vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. Arbekacin (ABK) also showed the relatively potent activity and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 4 microg/ml. Carbapenems showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 0.25-0.5 microg/ml. Cefozopran (CZOP) also had a preferable activity (MIC90: 1 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. In contrast, the resistant strains for cefaclor (CCL), erythromycin (EM), CLDM, and tetracycline (TC) were detected in 50.5%, 76.7%, 50.5%, and 80.6% of all the strains, respectively. Against H. influenzae, LVFX showed the most potent activity and inhibited the growth of 92 of all the strains (96.8%) at 0.063 microg/ml. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) and inhibited the growth of all the strains at 2 microg/ml. The antibacterial activity of CZOP was good and its MIC90 against mucoid and non-mucoid strains was 8 and 16 microg/ml, respectively. CZOP and cefpirome (CPR) were the most potent against K. pneumoniae with 0.125 microg/ml of MIC90. Also, all the agents generally showed potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis and the MIC90 of all drugs were 4 microg/ml or less. The approximately half the number (47.5%) of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older. As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 35.7 and 33.8% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. pneumoniae (22.6%). In contrast, S. aureus (16.6%) and P. aeruginosa (13.7%) were relatively frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were H. influenzae (24.5%) and S. pneumoniae (24.2%). In comparison of the isolated bacteria by pretreatment agents, P. aeruginosa was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with cephems or macrolides and H. influenzae was relatively frequently isolated from the patients pretreated with penicillins.
TI  - The role of unusual pathogens in prostatitis syndrome.
AB  - A total of 1442 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis were examined over  a 4-year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases "Dr. Fran Mihaljevic", Zagreb, Croatia. An infectious aetiology was determined in 1070 (74.2%) patients. In 561 of 1070 (52.4%) patients the inflammatory finding (>10 WBC/hpf) was found in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) or voided bladder urine (VB(3)). Normal, <10 WBCs/hpf was found in 362 of 536 (67.5%) patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis in whom Chlamydia trachomatis was detected in EPS or VB(3), in 51 of 151 (33.8%) patients with isolated Trichomonas vaginalis and in 40 of 72 (55.6%) patients with isolated Ureaplasma urealyticum. Escherichia coli was the causative pathogen in 95, Enterococcus in 68, Proteus mirabilis in 37, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 16, Streptococcus agalactiae in 19, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 3 patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection. In patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis (CBP) caused by E. coli, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae, E. or S. agalactiae, an inflammatory finding was regularly found in EPS or VB(3).
TI  - The changing pattern of bloodstream infections associated with the rise in HIV prevalence in northeastern Thailand.
AB  - A survey of bloodstream infections was conducted in the large regional hospital in Ubon Ratchatani, northeastern Thailand between 1989 and 1998, during the onset of the HIV epidemic. The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella/Enterobacter and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteraemias remained constant whereas infections caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, non-typhoid Salmonellae, Cryptococcus neoformans, Penicillum marneffei and to a lesser extent Streptococcus pneumoniae all rose. Burkholderia pseudomallei infections were unrelated to HIV, whereas the other infections were associated directly with HIV. Group D non-typhoid Salmonellae bloodstream infections (mainly Salmonella enteritidis) rose coincident with the increase in HIV seroprevalence, and preceded the increase in the other HIV-associated infections. Other non-typhoid Salmonella bacteraemias increased two years after the rise in group D infections, and invasive yeast infections increased four years later, coincident with the increase in AIDS. Increasing Group D non-typhoid Salmonella bloodstream infections are an early warning signal of an impending rise in AIDS.
TI  - Survival and surface adherence ability of bacterial pathogens in oral liquid pharmaceuticals and their containers.
AB  - The survival and surface adherence ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nutrient broth and in five oral liquid pharmaceuticals (nivaquine syrup, cough mixture, paracetamol elixir, cotrimoxazole and vitamin C) were investigated The bacteria grew more in nutrient broth than in the pharmaceuticals (p < 0. 001) and the recovery of stressed cells was enhanced when 3% Tween 80 was used as the recovery medium as against the use of normal saline (p < 0.01). The Gram-negative bacteria were more adapted to the pharmaceuticals than their Gram-positive counterparts. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Ps. aeruginosa were recovered in large numbers from nivaquine and cotrimoxazole suspensions that did not support the growth of the other bacteria. The effect of bacterial growth on the physico-chemical properties of the pharmaceuticals was also evaluated The properties were not altered significantly except for pH shifts of 0.3 to 1.1 caused by E. coli and S. aureus in paracetamol and vitamin C. Adherence capability was found to correlate with the survival ability of the bacteria. Populations on coupons were significantly higher when nutrient broth was used as the suspending medium compared with any of the pharmaceuticals (p < 0.01). Rubber and plastic coupons were significantly more accessible to the bacteria than glass coupon as revealed by the high population of bacteria recovered from their surfaces.
TI  - Community-acquired brain abscess in Taiwan: etiology and probable source of infection.
AB  - Brain abscess is a life-threatening infection caused by spread from infected parameningeal or remote foci. Historically, streptococci have been the predominant organisms reported while brain abscess metastatic from liver abscess caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae has been a more recent emerging problem. This study retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of community-acquired brain abscess admitted during an 11-year period. There were 17 men and 7 women with age from 20 to 82 years (median, 41 years). The most common source of infection was liver abscess, followed by otitic infection and sinusitis. The classic triad of fever, headache and focal neurologic deficit was noted in only 25% of cases. Spread of the abscess to multiple lobes was common (n = 6). The most commonly identified organisms were Streptococcus spp. (n = 7) and K. pneumoniae (n = 5). All 5 cases of K. pneumoniae brain abscess also had concomitant pyogenic liver abscess and 4 of them had diabetes mellitus. In this study, brain abscess was common in young patients and in patients with diabetes mellitus. In Taiwan, Streptococcus spp. and K. pneumoniae are leading etiologies for community-acquired brain abscess. Liver abscess is the most likely source of K. pneumoniae brain abscess.
TI  - [Bronchobiliary fistula associated with combined abscess of lung and liver].
AB  - HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A 43-year-old, cachectic, alcohol-addicted patient was admitted to the hospital due to hemoptysis and fever of up to 40 degrees C for the last 4 days. Physical examination revealed pleural rubs in the right lower lung and a diffuse pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. The right upper quadrant of the abdomen also showed scars from several surgical interventions on the small intestine, the liver and the biliary tract and deformed caudal ribs due to an accident 23 years earlier. DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPY, AND CLINICAL COURSE: Chest X-ray, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) showed abscess cavities in lung and liver communicating through the diaphragm. Under antibiotic therapy the abscess was drained. Cultures showed Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans. Continuous lavage of the abscess cavities and antibiotic therapy led to an improvement in parameters of inflammation and clinical status. Imaging after 10 days of treatment showed a contrast enrichment in the abscess cavities and a bronchobiliary fistula accounting for temporary biliptysis. The drainage was removed after 29 days, when similar imaging revealed no further sign of an abscess cavity and a previous CT follow-up had proven a distinct decrease of the abscesses. CONCLUSION: Bronchobiliary fistulas are very rare. In most cases they are caused by hepatic or subphrenic abscesses, resulting from different conditions. The development of an bronchobiliary fistula originating from a Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, as indicated by this report, has not been described so far. In the patient presented here, treatment was achieved due to continuous drainage despite the large extent of the abscess.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in hemodialyzed patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To analyze the clinical features, causative pathogens and therapeutic outcomes of bacterial meningitis in hemodialyzed patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-seven patients, > or = 16 yrs, were identified with culture-proven bacterial meningitis. In addition, the causative pathogens and therapeutic outcomes between uremic and non-uremic patients with adult bacterial meningitis were analyzed. RESULTS: Nine uremic patients with bacterial meningitis, accounting for 3% (9/267) of our adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis had fever, disturbed consciousness and seizures. These were the three most common manifestations in our patients. The interval between the onset of symptoms and therapy start was 5-11 days (mean: 9 days). No patients were initially diagnosed with bacterial meningitis, two patients were initially suspected of having infection of unknown origin. In the non-uremic patient group, klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most frequently detected pathogens, while pseudomonas aeruginosa and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were the most prevalent in the uremic patients group. The overall mortality rates for the non-uremic and uremic patient groups were 33 and 78% respectively. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate for bacterial meningitis in the uremic patients group remained high. Due to non-specific manifestations and slow evolution, bacterial meningitis was commonly misdiagnosed as uremic encephalopathy. Therefore, effective treatment was usually delayed. To avoid treatment failure, early diagnosis, careful monitoring of clinical condition and appropriate antibiotic choices are necessary.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - Incidence and etiological agents of bacterial meningitis among children <5 years  of age in two districts of Romania.
AB  - To expand upon the limited comprehensive population-based data for childhood bacterial meningitis in Eastern Europe, the present study was conducted in the Iasi and Constanta districts of Romania. From March 2000 through March 2002, children <5 years of age hospitalized for bacterial meningitis were enrolled in a prospective surveillance study. A total of 56 cases of bacterial meningitis were identified, including 37 due to Neisseria meningitidis (22 per 100,000 per year), 13 due to Haemophilus influenzae type b (7.6 per 100,000 per year), and six due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.5 per 100,000 per year). Of the 31 meningococcal isolates that were serotyped, 12 were serogroup A, eight were serogroup B, and 11 were serogroup C. Among all cases of bacterial meningitis, 25 occurred in children <1 year of age, including those due to meningococci (n=14), H. influenzae type b (n=7), pneumococci (n=3), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1). In Romania the incidence of H. influenzae type b meningitis is similar to that found in other areas of Southern and Eastern Europe during the pre-vaccination era, and the incidence of meningococcal meningitis is one of the highest yet found in Europe. An unexpectedly high proportion of these meningococcal meningitis cases is due to serogroup A. Disease burden could be substantially reduced through the introduction of H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine and, when available, meningococcal conjugate vaccine protective against serogroups A, B and C.
TI  - Corneal infections after implantation of intracorneal ring segments.
AB  - PURPOSE: To report risk factors, clinical course, and outcome in patients with infectious keratitis following implantation of intracorneal ring segments (ICRS). METHODS: The records of 8 patients with culture-proven infectious keratitis after ICRS (Ferrara or Intacs) implantation were retrospectively reviewed. Age, gender, corneal findings, ocular abnormalities, the condition that led to ICRS implantation, immediate prior use of a contact lens, elapsed time between implantation and the onset of symptoms, previous medications, and systemic disorders were noted. RESULTS: Culture-positive infectious keratitis developed in 7 eyes of 7 patients (2 men and 5 women) with a mean age of 35 years who underwent Ferrara implantation for the treatment of keratoconus and in a 29-year-old man who underwent Intacs implantation for correction of low myopia. Contact lens use, diabetes, and trauma were factors possibly associated with the risk of infection in three cases. Microorganisms, identified in all cases, included Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas sp, Nocardia sp, Klebsiella sp, and Paecylomices sp. Onset of symptoms of infection varied from less than 1 week to 22 months postoperatively, depending on the infecting organism. CONCLUSIONS: Infectious keratitis following ICRS implantation is a sight-threatening complication for which early recognition and rapid institution of appropriate treatment may result in a better visual outcome.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the Uro-Quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The Uro-Quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. In order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (NCCLS) and the Uro-Quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. The shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli and for ESBL- and Inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT)-producing E. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). The same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation and efflux-mediated), Streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and M-type) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis and Moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (OXA-R) Staphylococcus aureus and OXA-R Staphylococcus epidermidis. The same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Teicoplanin-resistant Staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (VanA, VanB, VanC) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (HLAR) Enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. The results obtained indicate that Uro-Quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.
TI  - Enteric gram-negative bacilli bloodstream infections: 17 years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the occurrence of enteric gram-negative bacilli (EGNB) bloodstream infections (BSI) in a neonatal intensive care setting during a 17-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment program was in place. To document infections, outbreaks, or epidemics, emergence of antibiotic resistance, clinical correlates, and outcomes of the most prevalent EGNB (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae). METHODS: This study analyzed demographic, clinical, and bacteriologic information from 360 infants born 1986-2002 who developed 633 blood culture-proven BSI. A total of 121 EGNB were isolated (E coli, K pneumoniae, and E cloacae). Early-onset BSI were discovered within 48 hours from birth, and late-onset BSI were those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSI were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, suspected late-onset BSI with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSI were noted in 52 of 21,336 (244/100,000) live births (1986-1991), 40 of 20,402 (196/100,000) live births (1992-1997), and 25 of 17,926 (139/100,000) live births (1998-2002). Of these cases, 39 were caused by E coli and 4 by K pneumoniae. Antibiograms for E coli isolated during the last 5 years of the study showed an increase in antibiotic resistance that coincided with obstetric group B streptococcus antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis. Group B streptococcus declined from 41 to 4 cases from the first to the last period. Late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases from the first to the second 6-year study period and declined modestly (171 cases) during the last. Fifteen percent (78 cases) of late-onset BSI were caused by EGNB, 5% by other gram-negative bacilli, 67% primarily by coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and 13% by fungus. Nonspecific clinical and hematologic signs of late-onset BSI were similar across EGNB species, but necrotizing enterocolitis was often associated with E coli, whereas pneumonia and prolonged thrombocytopenia characterized K pneumoniae infections. No outbreaks or epidemics were observed, and strains of EGNB with evidence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were never isolated. CONCLUSION: Antepartum antibiotic prophylaxis may have increased antibiotic resistance in E coli isolates from early-onset BSI but has dramatically decreased group B streptococcus infections. Late-onset BSI caused by EGNB increased, but without changes in antibiotic susceptibility. In spite of medical advances, E coli, K pneumoniae, and E cloacae remain responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in very low birth weight infants.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Rates of antimicrobial resistance among common bacterial pathogens causing respiratory, blood, urine, and skin and soft tissue infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns among the principal bacterial pathogens from infections of the respiratory tract, blood, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract of pediatric patients from the USA, Canada, Germany, France, and Italy were studied using the The Surveillance Network (TSN) database. Among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from respiratory tract infections, the prevalence of high-level penicillin resistance (MIC>/=2 microg/ml) ranged from 1.1 (Italy) to 36.2% (USA); erythromycin resistance was higher, ranging from 13.4 (Germany) to 63.8% (France). The prevalence of beta-lactamase-positive Haemophilus influenzae among isolates from lower respiratory tract infections ranged from <10 (Italy and Germany) to 38.4% (USA). Among isolates from blood and skin and soft tissue infections, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranged from 7.2% (Canada and Germany) to 27.3% (Italy). The prevalence of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae with putative extended-spectrum beta-lactamases among isolates from blood, urinary tract, and skin and soft tissue infections ranged from 0 (Germany and France) to 29.6% (Italy). With the exception of pseudomonal infections or infections with MRSA, amoxicillin-clavulanate retained moderate activity, whilst ceftriaxone and cefepime were the most effective broad-spectrum injectable agents. Meropenem was the most effective agent against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with <5% resistance. Low levels of resistance, along with acceptable safety profiles and the availability of convenient oral formulations, continue to support the use of ceftriaxone, cefepime, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and meropenem as viable options for the treatment of infections in pediatric patients.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Use of florfenicol in non-human primates.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine if florfenicol, an antimicrobial agent structurally similar to chloramphenicol, could be used as an effective broad spectrum antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in primates. Florfenicol was developed as an injectable antibiotic for use in cattle on an every other day dosing schedule. Its broad spectrum activity, long duration of action following i.m. administration, and its safety as compared with chloramphenicol made it an attractive antibiotic for use in non-human primates. Previous studies had shown that florfenicol is effective against common primate pathogens such as Salmonella, Klebsiella, Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. We performed experiments on a total of 15 macaques. The animals were given florfenicol at 50 mg/kg i.m. and blood samples taken at various time points. Serum was evaluated for florfenicol absorption. Necropsies were also performed to determine if major organs were affected and to determine the effects of i.m. injection of florfenicol. We determined that florfenicol given every 48 hours in rhesus macaques results in blood levels that were acceptable for therapeutic use. The effect on muscle tissue of i.m. injection was similar to ketamine and normal saline. There were no gross lesions observed and no changes with tissues submitted for histology. Our work shows that with further studies, florfenicol may be useful when injectable antibiotic therapy is required in non-human primates.
TI  - Management of postirradiation infection: lessons learned from animal models.
AB  - Ionizing radiation depresses host defenses and enhances susceptibility to local and systemic infection due to endogenous or exogenous microorganisms. Exposure of mice to a lethal dose of ionizing 60Co-gamma radiation induces a dose-related reduction in the number of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10(10-12) to 10(4-6) per gram of stool within 4 days. The number of anaerobic bacteria stays low, but the number of Enterobacteriaceae per gram of stool increases significantly up to 10(9) by the 12th day after irradiation. This increase is associated with bacterial translocation of these organisms and fatal bacteremia. The use of quinolones in the irradiated animals was effective in controlling systemic endogenous Gram-negative infection after irradiation. Supplementation with penicillin prevented treatment failures due to Streptococcus spp. and increased survival. Quinolones given for 21 days also were effective in management of systemic exogenous infections due to orally ingested Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Effectiveness of quinolones may be attributed to inhibition of exogenous organism growth within the gut lumen while preserving the anaerobic gut flora as well as their systemic antibacterial activity. Based on these findings, antimicrobial agents recommended for therapy of infection after exposure to irradiation are: ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, gentamicin +/- amoxicillin, or vancomycin.
TI  - Concentrations of moxifloxacin in serum and synovial fluid, and ex vivo bactericidal activity against arthritis-causing pathogens.
AB  - Three doses of moxifloxacin 400 mg qd were administered orally to 20 candidates for knee arthroscopy (mean age, 71.2 years). The procedure was scheduled at four different points of time after the last dose: 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. Five patients were studied at each point of time. Drug levels were determined by the bioassay method. Bactericidal activity against four bacterial pathogens (two strains of each) was studied on serum and synovial fluid samples obtained during arthroscopy using the NCCLS guidelines. Mean (+/-S.D.) peak serum and synovial fluid concentrations were 3.46 +/- 0.78 mg/L and 3.42 +/- 0.51 mg/L, respectively. Levels above 1.0 mg/L were detected as long as 24 h. The peak bactericidal titers were (in serum and synovial fluid, respectively) 1:18.3 and 1:32 against Staphylococcus aureus, 1:18.3 and 1:22.6 against Streptococcus pyogenes, 1:45.2 and 1:64.0 against Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1:2.3 and 1:1.7 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bactericidal titers >1:2 were documented against the first three pathogens up to 24 h after dosing. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, moxifloxacin seems to be an excellent candidate for the treatment of joint infections, except those caused by P. aeruginosa.
TI  - The effect of dietary fish oil on survival after infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Dietary fish oil is believed to have a beneficial effect in various infections and in autoimmune disorders. This effect may correspond to an altered immune response. In order to discover whether the effect of dietary fish oil is different in various infections, we studied the survival of mice fed fish oil or corn oil supplemented diets and infected in the lungs with either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae. 120 NMRI mice were divided into 4 groups, of which 2 groups were fed a fish oil supplemented diet and 2 a corn oil supplemented diet. After 6 weeks the mice were infected in the lungs with Klebsiella pneumoniae (fish oil groups and corn oil groups) or with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (both groups). The survival rate was monitored. The experiment was performed twice. The survival of the mice fed fish oil enriched diet and infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly better compared with the mice fed corn oil enriched diet (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0013). No difference was found between the mice fed corn oil enriched diet or fish oil enriched diet and infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3 (p = 0.74 and p = 0.15). Our results indicate that dietary fish oil has a beneficial effect on survival of mice after experimental pneumoniae when infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae, but not after infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Transthoracic lung aspiration in etiology of pneumonia.
AB  - Transthoracic lung aspiration was performed in 30 episodes of pneumonia in 27 children with malignancy on chemotherapy to assess etiology of pulmonary infections. Total of 22 organisms were isolated in 16/30 (53.3%) episodes. No acid fast bacilli or Pneumocystis carinii were seen. Organisms grown by blood culture correlated with that of lung puncture in 5 episodes, while throat culture and nasopharyngeal organisms correlated with that of lung puncture on one occasion each. Organisms isolated in 8/18 episodes (44.4%) of antemorten transthoracic aspiration included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Diphtheroids. In 3/18 episodes, lung puncture results altered treatment and thus resulted in survival of the patients. Only one minor complication occurred in this study--pneumothorax that resolved spontaneously. Thus, transthoracic lung puncture is an useful and safe procedure in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia who do not respond to initial broad spectrum antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from central nervous  system specimens as reported by U.S. hospital laboratories from 2000 to 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections of the central nervous system, especially acute  infections such as bacterial meningitis require immediate, invariably empiric antibiotic therapy. The widespread emergence of resistance among bacterial species is a cause for concern. Current antibacterial susceptibility data among central nervous system (CNS) pathogens is important to define current prevalence of resistance. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from CNS specimens was analyzed using The Surveillance Database (TSN) USA Database which gathers routine antibiotic susceptibility data from >300 US hospital laboratories. A total of 6029 organisms derived from CNS specimen sources during 2000-2002, were isolated and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: Staphylococcus aureus (23.7%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.0%) were the most common gram-positive pathogens. Gram-negative species comprised approximately 25% of isolates. The modal patient age was 1 or <1 year for most organisms. Prevalence of MRSA among S. aureus from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain abscesses were 29.9-32.9%. Penicillin resistance rates were 16.6% for S. pneumoniae, 5.3% for viridans group streptococci, and 0% for S. agalactiae. For CSF isolates, ceftriaxone resistance was S. pneumoniae (3.5%), E. coli (0.6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.8%), Serratia marcescens (5.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (25.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (0%). Listeria monocytogenes and N. meningitidis are not routinely susceptibility tested. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance is commonly detected, albeit still at relatively low levels for key drugs classes such as third-generation cephalosporins. This data demonstrates the need to consider predominant resistance phenotypes when choosing empiric therapies to treat CNS infections.
TI  - Challenges in antimicrobial drug discovery and the potential of nucleoside antibiotics.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in hospital and community settings is growing at an alarming rate and has been attributed to such organisms as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococci with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multi-drug resistant pseudomonas spp., klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp, and acinetobacter spp., as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased susceptibility to penicillin and other antibacterials. To address the need for new therapies to combat resistant organisms, drug companies are refocusing their discovery efforts on developing novel agents with new mechanisms of action. The hope is that rapidly emerging technologies including combinatorial chemistry, high throughput screening, proteomics and microbial genomics will have a positive impact on antimicrobial drug discovery. These technologies should aid in the identification of novel drug targets and compounds with unique mechanisms of action other than those currently provided by the traditional antibiotics. Nucleosides are one class of compounds worthy of further investigation as antibacterials since some derivatives have shown moderate to good activity against specific bacterial strains. For example, 5'-peptidyl nucleoside derivatives can inhibit peptide deformylase, an enzyme essential for bacterial survival that is not vital to human cells. This review also includes a list of miscellaneous nucleosides that have been synthesized as potential antibacterials. More detailed investigations on structure, as it relates to the antimicrobial activity of the various classes of nucleosides, need to be conducted in order to maximize the potential of developing a potent nucleoside for the treatment of bacterial infections. This review begins with an introduction to terms followed by discussions regarding the general background and relevance for developing novel antimicrobial agents. Challenges facing the antimicrobial drug discovery process are discussed along with relevant drug targets. An overview of nucleoside chemistry as it relates to antimicrobial activity is presented, followed by a discussion of the evidence which supports the potential of this class of compounds to yield the novel antimicrobial therapies needed in the new millennium.
TI  - [Etiology and clinical course of meningitis in children].
AB  - The aim of the paper was to pinpoint the etiological factors which caused meningitis, and to describe the course of the illness in the patients hospitalized in the years 1991-2000 at the observation ward of the Paediatrics Propaedeutics Clinic of the Paediatrics Institute. Etiological factors were determined in 42 of 80 cases included in the study: in 32 out of 62 purulent meningitis cases and 10 out of 18 aseptic meningitis cases. In purulent meningitis the most commonly isolated pathogens were N. meningitidis (16%), S. pneumoniae (8.1%), K. pneumoniae (4.9%) and H. influenzae type B (4.9%), where as in aseptic meningitis--mumps and herpes viruses. Despite appropriate treatment in 47% of cases there were observed complications such as hydrocephalus, brain oedema, ependymitis as well as hearing or vision impairment and failure to thrive.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in Taiwan. While some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be unique for specific regions. METHODS: To determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern Taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chia-Yi from January 2002 through December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The most common gram-positive isolate was Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance rate of S. aureus was 58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. The penicillin non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. Resistance to various antimicrobial agents for P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant A. baumannii was rarely encountered. Antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid Salmonella, S. choleraesuis and serogroup B isolates in particular. CONCLUSION: The high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. Continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of oral Cephems against various clinically isolated strains].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activities of oral Cephems against isolated from  the patients with the respiratory infections, the urinary tract infections, and infections in the obstetrics field of an adult and a child, during the period from 2002 to 2003; Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli of 40 strains of each, and Peptostreptococcus spp. 22 strains. S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains that resistant is regarded were collected mainly, penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae (BLNAR) strains. The MICs of Cephems except cefaclor (CCL) were < or = 0.03 microgram/mL against all strains of S. pyogenes. The MICs of cefteram (CFTM) and cefditoren (CDTR) were < or = 0.0125 microgram/mL activity against 7 strains penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (PSSP). However the MIC90s of cefditoren (CDTR) was 1 microgram/mL, cefteram (CFTM), and cefcapene (CFPN) were 2 micrograms/mL against PISP and PRSP, were higher than those of other drugs, but showed slightly higher than PSSP. The MIC90s of Cephems. were 0.5-4 micrograms/mL against strains of E. coli. The MIC90s of CFTM was 0.5 microgram/mL, and CDTR, CFPN were 1 microgram/mL against E. coli were higher than those of other drugs. The four strains of E. coli however were highly-resistant which MIC90s of CCL were more than 32 micrograms/mL were obtains. Furthermore it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant such as E. coli of Cephems. Although all strains showed resistant to AMPC, MIC90 of Cephems were 0.25-1 microgram/mL, good activities against K. pneumoniae. Against beta-lactamase negative ampicillin-susceptible H. influenzae (BLNAS) 23 strains the MIC90s of CCL and other Cephems were 64 micrograms/mL and 0.25-8 micrograms/mL. The MIC90s of CDTR and CFTM were < or = 1 microgram/mL of BLNAR (15 strains). However there of CFDN and CPDX were 8 micrograms/mL and CCL were > or = 16 micrograms/mL. Two strains which were produced beta-lactamase were highly--ABPC resistant. Although B. catarrhalis all strains were produced beta-lactamase and Cephems except for CCL showed better susceptibility than AMPC. The MIC90s of Cephems were 0.25-2 micrograms/mL against Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - [Prevalence of atypical pathogens in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia in Beijing].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), especially the prevalence of atypical pathogens. METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 103 consecutive adult patients with CAP between November 2001 and June 2002. Antibodies of the paired serum samples to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophilia, and Chlamydia pneumoniae were detected. The P1 adhesion gene of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and the 16S ribosome gene specific for Chlamydia pneumoniae were detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Legionella antigen in urine was detected using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method. Sputum samples were collected for culture, and bacteria were isolated and identified using conventional methods. RESULTS: The etiology of CAP was identified in 50 (48.5%) patients. The distribution of causal agents was as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 23 (22.3%) cases, Legionella pneumophilia 3 (2.9%), Chlamydia pneumoniae 2 (1.9%), streptococcus pneumoniae 12 (11.7%), Haemophilus influenzae 9 (8.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 7(6.8%). In 6 patients (5.8%) more than one causal agent were found, among them Mycoplasma pneumoniae was found in 5 cases with mixed infections. CONCLUSIONS: Atypical pathogens especially Mycoplasma pneumoniae have an important role in CAP. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae remain the most common bacteria, and mixed infection should not be ignored.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Haiti.
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the etiology of meningitis and sepsis in the newborn at the State University Hospital of Haiti and evaluate the susceptibility 'in vitro' of the pathogens to the antibiotics commonly used. This was a prospective case series study over a 10-month period (May 1997-February 1998) of 42 newborns with sepsis and/or meningitis. Besides the clinical signs, a positive blood culture and/or a positive culture of cerebrospinal fluid was present in each case. Gram-negative bacteria were most commonly found as a cause of early onset sepsis, with Enterobacter aerogenes as the most common agent. There were no such difference between gram-negative and gram-positive in late onset sepsis. Group B Streptococcus was associated with neonatal meningitis (44 per cent of cases) which was more related to gram-positive bacteria (66 per cent). Risk factors were vaginal discharge and dysuria in mothers, and low apgar score in newborns. Thirty-three per cent of the pathogens found, among them Klebsiella pneumoniae, were resistant 'in vitro' to ampicillin and gentamycin. All were susceptible to amikacin. Enterobacter aerogenes is an important pathogen in the etiology of early onset sepsis in the newborn at the State University Hospital of Haiti, while Group B Streptococcus is the leading cause of meningitis in that age group. Resistance to gentamycin should be taken into consideration for the treatment of sepsis and meningitis in the newborn.
TI  - Comparison of the microbicidal and muramidase activities of mouse lysozyme M and  P.
AB  - Lysozyme is one of the most abundant antimicrobial proteins in the airspaces of the lung. Mice express two lysozyme genes, lysozyme M and P, but only the M enzyme is detected in abundance in lung tissues. Disruption of the lysozyme M locus significantly increased bacterial burden and mortality following intratracheal infection with a Gram-negative bacterium. Unexpectedly, significant lysozyme enzyme activity (muramidase activity) was detected in the airspaces of uninfected lysozyme M-/- mice, amounting to 25% of the activity in wild-type mice. Muramidase activity in lysozyme M-/- mice was associated with increased lysozyme P mRNA and protein in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid respectively. The muramidase activity of recombinant lysozyme P was less than that of recombinant M lysozyme. Recombinant P lysozyme was also less effective in killing selected Gram-negative bacteria, requiring higher concentrations than lysozyme M to achieve the same level of killing. The lower antimicrobial activity of P lysozyme, coupled with incomplete compensation by P lysozyme in lysozyme M-/- mice, probably accounts for the increased susceptibility of null mice to infection. Recombinant lysozyme M and P were equally effective in killing selected Gram-positive organisms. This outcome suggests that disruption of both M and P loci would significantly increase susceptibility to airway infections, particularly those associated with colonization by Gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Bacteriology of mastoid subperiosteal abscess in children.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Subperiosteal abscess (SA) is the most frequent complication of acute  mastoiditis (AM). Of pathogens cultured from the external auditory canal or middle ear during myringotomy, 15% may be different from microorganisms isolated from the SA. We suggest, therefore, that only cultures obtained from the abscess cavity can truly reflect the bacteriology of this complication of AM. The purpose of our study was to analyze the infectious agents which cause SA and mastoid cortex erosion in children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The medical records of 35 children who underwent mastoidectomy for SA between May 1984 and April 2002 were evaluated. RESULTS: Mastoid cortex erosion was found at surgery in 72.7% of abscesses Purulent discharge was obtained from the SA cavity in 28 cases. The commonest pathogens isolated in these cases, as well as in 18 cases of mastoid cortex erosion, were Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Sterile culture was found in 25% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid SA is a unilateral disease that can recur. Early administration of anti-Staphylococcus medications should be considered for patients with SA as a complication of AM.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological profile of community acquired pneumonia in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common clinical problem. The  present study was designed to evaluate the clinical and bacteriological profile of CAP in Shimla. METHODS: Seventy patients with community acquired pneumonia were enrolled in this study. In all the patients blood culture, sputum culture, pleural fluid culture (if available) and serological studies for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae specific IgM antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were done. RESULTS: Of the 70 patients, 53 (75.6%) had an identifiable atiology with 12 patients having evidence of mixed infection. No organisms could be isolated in 17 patients inspite of using serological methods for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, invasive procedures like bronchoscopic aspirations in addition to the conventional methods like sputum culture, blood culture and pleural fluid culture. The most frequent pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 19; 35.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 12; 22%), Staphylococcus aureus in (n=9; 17%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 8; 15%), Escherichia Coli (n = 6; 11%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 4; 7.5%) and other Gram-negative bacilli (n = 5, 9%). CONCLUSION: Age smoking and under lying co-morbid conditions specially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were significantly associated with the development of CAP (p < 0.01).
TI  - [Polymicrobial infections in patients with Legionella pneumonia].
AB  - We assessed the frequency and clinical significance of polymicrobial infections in 31 patients with sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia. Twenty-six patients were men, 5 were women and mean age was 61 years. Eighteen patients were smokers, 6 patients were chronic alcoholics and 23 had underlying diseases. Regarding severity, the illnesses were mild (two patients), moderate (seven patients) and severe (twenty-two patients). In 9 (29%) of the patients, one other etiologic agent for community-acquired pneumonia was identified in addition to the Legionella species. The distribution of one other causal agent was as follows: Mycoplasma pneumoniae, 2 patients; Chlamydia pneumoniae, 2; Chlamydia psittaci, 1; Influenza virus, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 patient. Because an antimicrobial agent with activity against Legionella species can also provide coverage for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci, the patients with these coinfections improved without any complications. The patient with influenzavirus coinfection became seriously ill, and the condition was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation, renal failure and aspergillus bronchitis. The case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa coinfection was accompanied with a lung abscess and empyema. Our experience illustrates the importance of considering polymicrobial infections in patients with sporadic community-acquired Legionella pneumonia.
TI  - Role of Toll-like receptor 4 in gram-positive and gram-negative pneumonia in mice.
AB  - To determine the role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the immune response to pneumonia, C3H/HeJ mice (which display a mutant nonfunctional TLR4) and C3H/HeN wild-type mice were intranasally infected with either Streptococcus pneumoniae (a common gram-positive respiratory pathogen) or Klebsiella pneumoniae (a common gram-negative respiratory pathogen). In cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, TLR4 mutant mice showed a reduced survival only after infection with low-level bacterial doses, which was associated with a higher bacterial burden in their lungs 48 h postinfection. In Klebsiella pneumonia, TLR4 mutant mice demonstrated a shortened survival after infection with either a low- or a high-level bacterial dose together with an enhanced bacterial outgrowth in their lungs. These data suggest that TLR4 contributes to a protective immune response in both pneumococcal and Klebsiella pneumonia and that its role is more important in respiratory tract infection caused by the latter (gram-negative) pathogen.
TI  - High levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant HSP60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica in sera of patients with uveitis.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the levels of IgG class antibodies to recombinant heat shock protein 60 kDa of Yersinia enterocolitica (rHSP60Ye), Klebsiella pneumoniae (rHSP60Kp), Escherichia coli (rHSP60Ec), Shigella flexneri (rHSP60Sf), and Streptococcus pyogenes (rHSP60Sp) in the serum of patients with HLA-B27 associated acute anterior uveitis (HLA-B27 associated AAU), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (idiopathic AAU), pars planitis, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH), and healthy subjects. METHODS: The genes that code for HSP60Ye, HSP60Kp, HSP60Ec, HSP60Sf, and HSP60Sp were cloned by PCR from genomic DNA. The rHSPs were purified by affinity using a Ni-NTA resin. The serum levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60s were determined by ELISA in patients with uveitis (n = 42) and in healthy subjects (n = 25). RESULTS: The majority of patients with uveitis had higher levels of IgG class antibodies to rHSP60Ye compared with levels of healthy subjects (p = 0.01), although these differences were only observed in the HLA-B27 associated AAU (p = 0.005) and in pars planitis patients (p = 0.001). The levels of IgG antibodies to the rHSP60Kp, rHSP60Sf, rHSP60Ec, and rHSP60Sp were similar in patients with uveitis and in healthy subjects (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that HSP60Ye could be involved in the aetiology of HLA-B27 associated AAU and pars planitis.
TI  - Antibiotic consumption, bacterial resistance and their correlation in a Swiss university hospital and its adult intensive care units.
AB  - Ecological surveys of high-antibiotic use areas in the hospital should be used to evaluate patterns and trends in order to optimise antibiotic consumption and minimise resistance. We conducted a retrospective cohort study with the aim to examine trends in antimicrobial consumption and bacterial susceptibility at the Geneva University Hospital and its adult ICUs between 1996 and 2000. The average annual consumption of antimicrobials was 400 d-defined doses (DDD)/1000 patient-d in the entire hospital, 462 in the surgical ICU and 683 in the medical ICU. In the medical ICU, we observed a steady decrease of intravenous antimicrobial use, whereas a 25% increase in the total antimicrobial consumption was noted in 1999 and 2000 for the entire hospital. The proportion of different bacterial species, resistance rates and antibiotic consumption rates differed between the entire hospital and the ICUs, with moderate variation between y. Possible relationships between antibiotic consumption and resistance rates, expressed as DDD and as number of resistant isolates per 1000 patient-d respectively, were calculated for of the most frequently isolated bacteria (total 71 correlations). Statistically significant positive correlations between antibiotic consumption and resistance were found in Escherichia coli for piperacillin, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for piperacillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides, in Klebsiella spp. for cephalosporin, in coagulase-negative staphylococci for gentamicin and in Streptococcus pneumoniae for penicillin.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2001)].
AB  - From October 2001 to September 2002, we collected the specimen from 370 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of the isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 458 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 456 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 69, Streptococcus pneumoniae 72, Haemophilus influenzae 85, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 44, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 13, Klebsiella pneumoniae 32, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 32, and others. Of 69 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/mL or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 43.5%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 2000. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 59.7% and both rates of PISP and PRSP were the highest after 1992. Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem and imipenem inhibited the growth of all 72 strains at 0.125 and 0.5 microgram/mL, respectively. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC90s of 16 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. influenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 80 of the 85 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Against P. aeruginosa mucoid strain, meropenem had a strong activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL while, against non-mucoid strain, tobramycin had a strong activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline, and the MIC90s were 4 micrograms/mL or less. Particularly, cefmenoxime, cefpirome, and imipenem had the strongest activity (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL), and cefozopran had a strong activity, inhibiting the growth of all strains at 0.25 microgram/mL. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC90s of all drugs were 4 micrograms/mL or less. The drug that had the strongest activity was minocycline and levofloxacin inhibiting all 32 strains at 0.063 microgram/mL. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (40.5%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 39.2% and 37.3% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (19.3%) and S. pneumoniae (19.9%). In contrast, H. influenzae (22.0%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from the patients were S. pneumoniae (20.8%) and H. influenzae (21.5%). S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae decreased after the initiation of drug administration while S. aureus increased. The isolation frequency of P. aeruginosa was higher after than before the initiation of drug administration. The bacteria were frequently isolated from the patients who had already treated with cephems were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. From the patients who had already treated with macrolides, S. pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated while S. aureus was the most frequently isolated from the patients pre-treated with quinolones.
TI  - [Is the mother's bacterial vaginosis with PROM a significant factor for intrauterine infection of the fetus in preterm labor before 32 weeks of gestation].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial vaginosis of pregnant woman is an important factor of appearance of the PROM in result of intrauterine infections on every stage of pregnancy. Frequency exist of intrauterine infection evaluate from 1 to 10% pregnancies. Clinical chorio-amnionitis complicates 1-5% of term pregnancies, but nearly 25% of preterm deliveries and really increase morbidity and mortality of newborns and they are also a reason of mothers morbidity. A condition of recognition the intrauterine infections is ascertainment of infection factor risk of mother and appearance of clinic symptoms of newborns. The aim of this work was a valuation of dependence between bacterial flora taken from cervics uteri of pregnant woman with PROM who gave birth with preterm below 32 weeks and a presence of clinic and laboratory symptoms of infections and the presence of bacterial flora in blood culture of the newborns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 37 pregnant women at the age from 20 to 43 hospitalized in Department Perinatology ICZMP between 1999-2001 because of PROM and a threat of preterm labor at the fetal age from 24 to 32 weeks were taken by an analysis. The average time of amniotic liquid outflowing before the labor was 11.1 days +/- 8.63, average length persistence of pregnancy was 27.6 hbd +/- 1.85, average born mass was 1029 g +/- 187.5. Laboratory factors and clinics symptoms chorionamnionitis, bacteriology cultures of swabs from cervics uteri and information of the labor of pregnant women were analyzed. Diagnostics of newborns contained: making of blood cultures and skin, nose, throat, urine cultures, estimation WBC and level CRP, estimation of lungs X-ray. RESULTS: In result of bacteriology cultures from cervics uteri of mothers gained bacteria of frequent occurrence: Staphylococcus epiderm.--27%, E. coli--19%, Streptococcus gr. B--10.8%, Enterococcus foecalis--8.1%. In result of bacteriology cultures of newborns blood gained bacteria of frequent occurrence: Staphylococcus epiderm.--13.5%, Staphylococcus haemolitycus--10.8%, Klebsiella pneumoniae--10.8%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa--8.1%. In 97.3% cases at newborns appeared inborn infections in a shape of pneumonia confirmed by X-ray. Confirmation of intrauterine infection in histopathology examination of the placenta in a shape of chorionamnionitis was shown in 25 cases, in other words in 67.5%. Positive results of pathogenic bacteriology flora cultures taken from cervics uteri was in 50% pregnant woman, however in 43% of newborns bacteriology cultures of the blood were positive. In none of the analyzed preterm labor cases with PROM bacterial flora from positive cultures taken from cervics uteri of mothers did not correlate with bacterial flora found in blood cultures of newborns. CONCLUSIONS: On a base of analyzed values PROM of mothers with bacterial vaginosis is the important factor risk of the evolution of intrauterine infections of newborns, besides did not ascertain the dependence between the values of bacteriology cultures taken from cervics uteri of mothers and the values of bacteriology cultures of the newborns blood with clinic symptoms of intrauterine infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of local cough mixtures on upper respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The punched-hole and the paper disc diffusion methods were used in screening for  the antimicrobial activity of six common ingredients used locally in cough mixtures, against the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp, Salmonella paratyphi, Shigella dysenteria, Shigella sonnei and Candida albicans. The results, evaluated as the diameter of zone of inhibition of microbial growth, showed that lime, garlic onion, onion and honey were active against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Shigella dysenteriae. Bitter-kola nut extract and palm kernel oil showed no antimicrobial activities against any of the tested organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of Salmonella paratyphi and Shigella sonnei and the most susceptible organisms were Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.
TI  - Investigation of antimicrobial use pattern in the intensive treatment unit of a teaching hospital in western Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antimicrobials is of special importance in the intensive treatment unit because of the large number of drugs prescribed, the chance for drug errors, and the likelihood of development of drug resistance. METHODS: A total of 297 records of patients admitted to the intensive treatment unit of the Manipal teaching hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Pokhara, western Nepal, were studied to determine the prescribing frequency and rationality of use of antimicrobials. Patient outcome, duration of stay in the intensive treatment unit, and the age and sex distribution of the patients were also studied. RESULTS: Mean+/-SD drugs per patient was 3.4+/-1.8. About half (50.2%) of the patients received an antimicrobial; 84.6% of the antimicrobials were used without obtaining bacteriologic evidence of infection. The commonest organisms isolated on culture were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 28.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed for lower respiratory tract infections on the basis of the putative site of infection; 61.9% of the antimicrobials were prescribed by the parenteral route and mainly the older generation of antimicrobials were used. In 39 of the 149 patients prescribed an antimicrobial, the use was irrational. CONCLUSIONS: Prescriber education to improve prescribing patterns and regular auditing of antimicrobial prescriptions to prevent their inappropriate use and unnecessary cost to the patients are required. The high percentage of inappropriate use of antimicrobials raises concerns about the development and spread of drug resistance, which must be addressed.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of the new des-f(6)-quinolone garenoxacin in a murine thigh infection model.
AB  - Garenoxacin is a new des-F(6)-quinolone with broad-spectrum activity against both gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. We used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of garenoxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) parameter best correlated with efficacy. Serum drug levels following three fourfold-escalating single-dose levels of garenoxacin were measured by microbiologic assay. In vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) were determined after doses of 16 and 64 mg/kg of body weight. Mice had 10(6.5) to 10(6.7) CFU of Streptococcus pneumoniae strain ATCC 10813 or Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC 33591 per thigh when they were treated for 24 h with garenoxacin at a dose of 4 to 128 mg/kg/day fractionated for 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-hour dosing regimens. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which PK-PD parameter best correlated with the measurement of CFU/thigh at 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies yielded peak/dose values of 0.2 to 0.3, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/dose values of 0.1 to 0.5, and half-lives of 0.7 to 1.6 h. Garenoxacin produced in vivo PAEs of 1.4 to 8.2 h with S. pneumoniae ATCC 10813, 7.6 to >12.4 h with S. aureus ATCC 25923, and 0 to 1.5 h with Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816. The 24-h AUC/MIC ratio was the PK-PD parameter that best correlated with efficacy (R2=71 to 90% for the two organisms compared with 43 to 56% for the peak/MIC ratio and 47 to 75% for percent time above the MIC [% T>MIC]). In subsequent studies we used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to determine if the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio needed for efficacy of garenoxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains). Mice had 10(5.9) to 10(7.2) CFU of 6 strains of S. aureus (2 methicillin resistant), 11 strains of S. pneumoniae (5 penicillin susceptible, 1 penicillin intermediate, and 5 penicillin resistant, and of the resistant strains, 3 were also ciprofloxacin resistant), and 4 gram-negative strains per thigh when treated for 24 h with 1 to 64 mg of garenoxacin per kg every 12 h. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the doses (mg/kg/24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. MICs ranged from 0.008 to 4 microg/ml. The free drug 24-h AUC/MIC ratios for each static dose (2.8 to 128 mg/kg/day) varied from 8.2 to 145. The mean 24-h AUC/MIC ratios +/- standard deviations for S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and gram-negative strains were 33 +/- 18, 81 +/- 37, and 33 +/- 30, respectively. Methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio required for efficacy.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Thrombomodulin mutant mice with a strongly reduced capacity to generate activated protein C have an unaltered pulmonary immune response to respiratory pathogens and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The thrombomodulin-protein C-protein S (TM-PC-PS) pathway exerts anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the role of TM in the pulmonary immune response in vivo by the use of mice with a mutation in the TM gene (TM(pro/pro)) that was earlier found to result in a minimal capacity for activated PC (APC) generation in the circulation. We here demonstrate that TM(pro/pro) mice also display a strongly reduced capacity to produce APC in the alveolar compartment upon intrapulmonary delivery of PC and thrombin. We monitored procoagulant and inflammatory changes in the lung during Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae) pneumonia and after local administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Bacterial pneumonia was associated with fibrin(ogen) depositions in the lung that colocalized with inflammatory infiltrates. LPS also induced a rise in thrombin-antithrombin complexes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These pulmonary procoagulant responses were unaltered in TM(pro/pro) mice, except for enhanced fibrin(ogen) deposition during pneumococcal pneumonia. In addition, TM(pro/pro) mice displayed unchanged antibacterial defense, neutrophil recruitment, and cytokine/chemokine levels. These data suggest that the capacity of TM to generate APC does not play a role of importance in the pulmonary response to respiratory pathogens or LPS.
TI  - Bacteremia in hematological and oncological children with febrile neutropenia: experience in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with febrile neutropenia admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from January 1999 to December 1999 was performed. There were 190 episodes of febrile neutropenia during this period and 46 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 38 bacteremic episodes (7 mixed infections). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.9%), and Enterobacter cloacae (10.9%) were the most common isolates. Three of the 5 isolates of S. aureus were resistant to methicillin. Twenty-three episodes of bacteremia (four mixed infections) were associated with recent antibiotic use. Of the 23 bacteremic episodes with recent antibiotic use, P. aeruginosa (20%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (10%), K. pneumoniae (10%), Escherichia coli (10%), and E. cloacae (10%) were isolated most often. Relapsed leukemia (odds ratio 3, 95% confidence interval 1.4-6.5) and recent antibiotic therapy (odds ratio 3.4, 95% confidence interval 1.7-7.7) were the independent risk factors of bacteremia. There were 9 mortality cases in patients with bacteremia, including 4 cases with mixed infections, and 5 cases with P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, S. aureus, and Streptococcus mitis, respectively. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were necessary in febrile neutropenic children because of the high percentage of mixed infection.
TI  - Susceptibility trends in bacteraemias: analyses of 7544 patient-unique bacteraemic episodes spanning 11 years (1990-2000).
AB  - The aim of the present study was to design more accurate tools for the selection  of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for hospitalized patients with suspected sepsis. We created a large database comprising data on all patient-unique blood cultures obtained over an 11 year period (1 January, 1990 through 31 December, 2000). Improved statistical tools were applied to assess the trends in in vitro activity of individual antibiotic agents against various bacteria over time, and to calculate susceptibility rates of subsets of organisms. During the 11 year study period, 173571 blood cultures were obtained, of which 17703 (10.2%) were positive, with 7544 patient-unique blood cultures (4.3%). The mean annual number of positive, patient-unique cultures was 686 (standard deviation=79). The 10 most frequently isolated organisms were: Escherichia coli (1494), Staphylococcus aureus (1240), Klebsiella pneumoniae (779), Enterococcus spp. (631), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (488), Streptococcus pneumoniae (447), Enterobacter spp. (338), Acinetobacter spp. (298), Proteus mirabilis (260) and Candida spp. (254). No significant change was detected in the annual rates (means, standard deviations) per 1000 admissions of these organisms: the highest was E. coli (5.5, 1), the lowest was Candida (1, 0.3). Forty percent of organisms (N=2943) were obtained from patients in the emergency department (ED), 23% (1744) in medical departments, 15% (1134) in paediatric units, 13% (998) on surgical wards and 9% (709) in intensive care units (ICUs). Trend statistical analysis revealed a significant decrease in susceptibility in ED Enterobacteriaceae to eight of 15 (53%) tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 1.6%+/-0.6%, in the ICU isolates, a significant decrease was detected in only five (33%) of the tested antimicrobials, with a mean annual decrease of 2.5%+/-1.3%. The difference in susceptibility between ED and ICU isolates was significant for all antimicrobials (P<0.001). A significant decrease in the susceptibility of E coli to nine of 15 drugs (60%) was detected, ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% annually. In K. pneumoniae a significant decrease in susceptibility of K. pneumoniae was detected with only two agents. Pseudomonas spp. isolates remained highly sensitive to all traditional anti-pseudomonal agents, without significant decay in sensitivity rates over time. Susceptibility of S. aureus to methicillin decreased significantly for several subsets of patients (P<0.001). Marked differences in susceptibility rates between the departments were detected. Trend statistical analyses, when appropriately applied to multi-year databases of microbial susceptibilities, may yield susceptibility tables that are significantly more accurate than traditional semi-annual or annual tables.
TI  - Bacteriological status of canine milk and septicaemia in neonatal puppies--a retrospective study.
AB  - Results of the bacteriological examination of milk samples from 46 bitches were evaluated retrospectively, and correlated with findings of the bacteriological examination of organs from dead, septicaemic puppies in their litters (n = 33). The aim of this study was to investigate, in how many cases of clinical and subclinical mastitis of the bitches, the same bacteria can be detected in their septicaemic neonates. One group of lactating bitches was clinically healthy (group I, n = 38), whereas in eight bitches different puerperal disorders were found (group II). Twenty-five septicaemic puppies were from group I, eight from group II. Out of a broad spectrum of bacteria isolated from the milk of clinically healthy and diseased bitches, only Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and/or ss-haemolytic (haem.) Streptococcus sp. could be isolated from organs of their septicaemic puppies. This was the case in three bitches with mastitis and in one clinically healthy bitch only. Staphylococcus intermedius, although frequently isolated from canine milk, does not seem to be a cause of septicaemia in neonates. It is assumed that in most cases of neonate septicaemia, bacteria from the bitches' milk are not the primary cause.
TI  - Bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  - Studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. Immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (PS) antigen, interactions with T- and B-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. Meningococcal, pneumococcal and Salmonella vi PSs and Haemophilus type b PS-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. Capsular PSs are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. Many PSs are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. Most pneumococcal PSs are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as D-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. Extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular PSs. In infants the antibody responses to most capsular PSs are generally poor. Enhanced immunogenicity of PS antigens can be achieved through PS-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.
TI  - Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release tablets: a new antimicrobial for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Community-acquired bacterial respiratory tract infections are among the most common health disorders requiring medical care and are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and direct and indirect costs. Recent increases in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have resulted in reduced susceptibility of the most common respiratory tract bacterial pathogens to a number of antimicrobials. Amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium extended release (ER) tablets (Augmentin XR, GlaxoSmithKline) is a new formulation of amoxicillin/clavulanate that retains activity against betalactamase-producing organisms whilst increasing the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae through elevated and sustained plasma amoxicillin concentrations. The bilayer tablet provides immediate release of clavulanate and both immediate and sustained release of amoxicillin to maintain therapeutic concentrations of amoxicillin over longer periods of the dosing interval. In clinical trials of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), amoxicillin/clavulanate ER was shown to have excellent bacteriological and clinical success rates, even in patients infected with antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and was found to be generally well tolerated. Amoxicillin/clavulanate ER is approved in the US for the treatment of patients with ABS or CAP caused by beta-lactamase-producing pathogens (ie, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus) and S. pneumoniae with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (penicillin minimum inhibitory concentration = 2.0 microg/ml).
TI  - Bacterial pathogens and outcome determinants of childhood pyogenic meningitis in  Ilorin, Nigeria.
AB  - Empirical antimicrobial therapy remainsjustifiable in childhood pyogenic meningitis (CPM), but the continuing efficacy in a particular setting requires periodic microbiological surveillance. It was this need that informed the present five-year retrospective study of consecutive admissions for CPM at the Emergency Paediatric Unit (EPU) of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, Nigeria. Of the 71 cerebro-spinal fluid [CSF] analyses, 41 (57.6%) were Gram-smear positive (GSP). Gram-positive cocci (GPC) were identified in 23 (56.1%) smears, while 14 (34.2.%) had Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Only three (7.3%) had Gram-negative diplococci (GND). Despite corroborative biochemical findings, the remaining 30 (42.3%), including two with tuberculous meningitis proved smear-negative. GPC cases had a mean age of 4.49 +/- 5.3yrs, GNB, 3.06 +/- 4.8yrs and GND, 4.47 +/- 4.9yrs. CSF isolates were made in 28 (39.4%) cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for a predominant 22 (78.6%) (P = 0.00), Haemophilus influenzae for 2 (7.1%), and Neisseria meningitidis for only 1 (3.5%) case. Whereas Strept. pneumoniae and H. influenzae isolates were uniformly sensitive to each of sultamicillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, 7.7% of Strept. pneumoniae were resistant to crystalline penicillin, 6.7% to ampicillin, and 69.2% to chloramphenicol; one of the two H. influenzae isolates was chloramphenicol-resistant. Amongst the 30 (42.3%) fatal cases, the length of stay was significantly shorter in GNB-positive cases (P = 0.045). Mortality was significantly higher amongst cases with purulent/turbid CSF at admission (P = 0.03), and in those with CSF protein of >150mg/dl (P = 0.02) and glucose <1mg/dl (P = 0.047). The present aetiological preponderance of GPC and Strept. pneumoniae in our study population, the high case-fatality, and the emerging resistance profile suggest the need for exploring additional control options including vaccination. We emphasize the need for periodic auditing of local antimicrobial policies in CPM.
TI  - Postantibiotic, postantibiotic sub-MIC, and subinhibitory effects of PGE-9509924, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.
AB  - Postantibiotic effects (PAEs), postantibiotic sub-MIC effects, and sub-MIC effects of the new nonfluoroquinolone PGE-9509924, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative strains were investigated. In comparison to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, PGE-9509924 exerted very similar PAEs against all strains except for both strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, where longer PAEs were found for PGE-9509924. All three investigated quinolones showed no minimal PAEs against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Severe bacterial infection in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major.
AB  - The incidence and clinical spectrum of severe bacterial infection were studied in 89 patients with thalassemia major that was diagnosed between January 1971 and March 2002. There were 20 patients with 24 episodes of severe bacterial infection, resulting in an incidence of 1.6 infections per 100 patient-years. The clinical spectrum included liver abscess (6 cases), septicemia (6 cases), soft-tissue infection (2 cases), osteomyelitis (2 cases), corneal ulcer (1 case), enteritis (1 case), and abscesses of the lung, kidney, intra-abdominal region, retropharynx, gums, and buttocks (1 case each). The leading causal microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 of 20 isolates). Other responsible pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/20), Vibrio vulnificus (2/20), Acinetobacter baumanii (1/20), Streptococcus intermidius (1/20), Yersinia enterocolitica (1/20), Staphylococcus aureus (1/20), Escherichia coli (1/20), and Salmonella species (1/20). Splenectomy and delays in the start of iron-chelating therapy were 2 independent risk factors.
TI  - Contemporary re-evaluation of the activity and spectrum of grepafloxacin tested against isolates in the United States.
AB  - Grepafloxacin potency and spectrum of activity were re-evaluated against contemporary pathogens collected from clinical infections in 2001-2002. A total of 995 isolates were tested for grepafloxacin by the reference agar dilution method and these results were compared to those of 25 other antimicrobial agents. Grepafloxacin activity remained comparable to that of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (MIC(90), 0.03-2 microg/ml; 0.0-7.7% resistance rates). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, grepafloxacin was active against ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC(90), 2 microg/ml), but not against ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC(90), >8 microg/ml) isolates. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, grepafloxacin susceptibility rate was 91.4%, equal to that of levofloxacin. None of the fluoroquinolones showed reasonable activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Gatifloxacin and grepafloxacin had the same MIC(90) against beta-hemolytic streptococci (0.25 microg/ml) and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.25 microg/ml). Grepafloxacin and other fluoroquinolone activities were not influenced by penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae. Grepafloxacin was very active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.03 microg/ml) and Legionella spp. (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). These results on recently isolated organisms indicate that grepafloxacin has a sustained potency and spectrum against most clinically important and indicated pathogens.
TI  - Levofloxacin pharmacokinetics in ESRD and removal by the cellulose acetate high performance-210 hemodialyzer.
AB  - BACKGROUND: No published data are available describing the pharmacokinetics of intravenous levofloxacin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objectives of this study are to determine the pharmacokinetics and dialytic clearance of levofloxacin and develop dosing strategies in these patients. METHODS: Eight noninfected subjects receiving long-term thrice-weekly hemodialysis, with no measurable residual renal function, were administered intravenous levofloxacin, 250 mg, over 1 hour after a scheduled hemodialysis session. Blood samples were collected serially during the interdialytic period, during the next intradialytic period, and immediately after the next hemodialysis session. Serum concentrations of levofloxacin were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Differential equations describing a 2-compartment open-infusion pharmacokinetic model were fit to each individual subject's serum concentration-time data by iterative nonlinear weighted least-squares regression analysis using Adapt II (Biomedical Simulations Resource, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). Ratios of maximum serum concentration (C(max)) to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were calculated for common respiratory pathogens by using MIC for 90% of isolates (MIC90) data from published studies. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study, and no adverse events were reported. Median systemic clearance, volume of distribution at steady state, elimination half-life, and C(max) were 37.0 mL/min (range, 12.8 to 42.7 mL/min), 103.3 L (range, 39.8 to 139.3 L), 34.4 hours (range, 28.4 to 39.3 hours), and 5.2 microg/mL (range, 4.1 to 11.3 microg/mL), respectively. Median dialytic clearance and levofloxacin reduction ratios were 84.4 mL/min (range, 61.8 to 107.6 mL/min) and 0.244 (range, 0.181 to 0.412), respectively. Median C(max)-MIC90 ratios were 10 or greater for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Enterobacter cloacae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, approximately 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and less than 1 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The administration of levofloxacin to patients with ESRD as 500 mg initially, followed by 250 mg every 48 hours, will provide adequate C(max)-MIC ratios after the first and subsequent doses for most patients with respiratory tract infections caused by organisms with levofloxacin MICs of 1 microg/mL or less.
TI  - Brain abscess: clinical analysis of 53 cases.
AB  - Fifty-three cases of brain abscess were treated at Mackay Memorial Hospital from  January 1991 through December 2001. The ages ranged from 2 weeks to 84 years, with a peak at 40 to 50 years (11/53, 21%). The male to female ratio was 1.8:1 (34 males, 19 females). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (30/53, 57%), headache (29/53, 55%), and changed mental status (24/53, 45%). The duration of symptoms before hospitalization ranged from several hours to 2 months. A shorter duration of symptoms was associated with poor outcome. The common predisposing factors were otic infection (10/53, 19%), penetrating head trauma and neurosurgery (10/53, 19%), and bacterial endocarditis (5/53, 9%). The leading underlying diseases were diabetes mellitus (12/53, 23%) and/or liver cirrhosis (6/53, 11%), and both were independently associated with increased risk of mortality. Computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging facilitated early diagnosis and proper management. Surgical intervention was used together with antibiotics in 33 (62%) of 53 patients in whom the average abscesses diameter was 3.75 cm (range, 2-6 cm). The remaining 20 (38%) patients whose average abscesses diameter was 2.3 cm (range, 1-3.5 cm) were treated with antibiotics only. Culture of material drained from abscesses isolated 27 microorganisms from 19 (58%) of the 33 patients, 81% (22/27) of which were aerobic and 19% (5/27) anaerobic bacteria. The most common pathogen was alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (6/27, 22%). Most of the patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from brain abscess, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood cultures were diabetic. A high mortality rate (9/20, 45%) was found in patients with medical treatment. A high index of suspicion is needed for the early diagnosis of brain abscess, particularly in patients with predisposing factors. In this series, early diagnosis using computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance scanning, optimal timing of surgery, and appropriate use of antibiotics were associated with improved outcome.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates by E test.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against several gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates was tested by E test. We found that the MIC(50) and MIC(90) values against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family except Serratia were <0.5 mg/l for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (MIC range 0.006-32 mg/l) based on the in vitro susceptibility data. The susceptibility rates for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more than 85% for Escherichia coli, citrobacter, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae, although Serratia and Acinetobacter exhibited more or less similar susceptibility rates (about 80%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa demonstrated significant resistance to fluoroquinolones (MIC(90) >32 mg/l) and decreased bactericidal rates (<65%) to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Respiratory pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were highly susceptible (100%) to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. The ineffectiveness of fluoroquinolones for treating coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated by poor in vitro susceptibility rates with levofloxacin (52%) and moxifloxacin (57%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci demonstrated significantly decreased bactericidal rates to levofloxacin (21%), while the in vitro susceptibility to moxifloxacin was higher (66%) than that to levofloxacin. We propose that the beneficial effect of inclusion of any of these three fluoroquinolones in treating Enterococcus infections is marginal, as demonstrated by significantly reduced susceptibility rates (<32%). These data demonstrate the utility of fluoroquinoles to treat several gram-negative bacterial infections (with the exception of Acinetobacter and P. aeruginosa), as well as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - Bacterial translocation after cirrhotic liver resection: a clinical investigation of 181 patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhotic patients are usually associated with a high susceptibility  to infection. Although bacterial translocation from gut mucosa to mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and systemic circulation is a well-known phenomenon after hepatectomy, its role in cirrhotic patients remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MLN was harvested for bacterial culture before and after liver resection in 181 cirrhotic patients. The characteristics and postoperative courses of patients with positive and negative bacterial culture for MLN after hepatectomy were compared. Postoperative systemic antibiotics were administered if infectious complications occurred. RESULTS: No bacteria were cultured in MLN before hepatectomy. Bacterial translocation (BT) to MLN after hepatectomy occurred in 36 patients (BT group). After multivariate analysis, intraoperative blood transfusion was the only independent factor that influenced bacterial translocation rates after cirrhotic liver resection. BT group patients also had higher infectious and overall complication rates, with a longer postoperative hospital stay. Among the cultured bacteriae from infected sites in BT group patients with infectious complications, only 2 patients (12.5%) had totally different bacterial species to those cultured from MLNs. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial translocation more often occurred after liver resection in cirrhotic patients who received intraoperative blood transfusion. Such patients had higher postoperative infectious and overall complication rates. Thus, avoidance of intraoperative blood transfusion is mandatory for cirrhotic liver resection.
TI  - Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis: a 17-year prospective series and review of  267 reported cases.
AB  - Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare but serious condition that occurs  when bacteria cross the blood-ocular barrier and multiply within the eye. We provide an overview of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis by reviewing 267 reported cases and integrating this with our experience of an additional 19 cases. The majority of patients with endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis are initially misdiagnosed and many have an underlying disease known to predispose to infection. This condition is often previously undiagnosed. Blood cultures are the most frequent means of establishing the diagnosis. The most common Gram positive organisms are Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae,and Listeria monocytogenes. The most common Gram negative organisms are Klebsiella spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis. Gram negative organisms are responsible for the majority of cases reported from East Asian hospitals, but Gram positive organisms are more common in North America and Europe. The visual outcome is poor with most cases leading to blindness in the affected eye. Many patients have extraocular foci of infection, with an associated mortality rate of 5%. The outcome of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis has not improved in 55 years and clinicians need to have a high level of awareness of this commonly misdiagnosed condition.
TI  - Evaluation of infectious etiology and prognostic risk factors of febrile episodes in neutropenic cancer patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Febrile neutropenic cancer patients are at risk for development of serious infections, morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the type and frequency of infections and to evaluate some prognostic risk factors. METHODS: 220 episodes of neutropenic fever in 177 cancer patients have been reviewed. RESULTS: Infections could be documented microbiologically in 38 (17.3%) episodes and suspected clinically in 29 (13.2%). The most common focus of infection was the lower respiratory tract (11.4%) followed by the urinary tract (6.4%). The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (31%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). The median durations of neutropenia and fever were 4 and 3 days, respectively. Mortality was seen in 25 patients (11.4%). Its rate was higher in documented infections except for non-bacteremic microbiologic infections in which no death was seen. Hypotension and shock were the most significant determinants of poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The management of these special patients should be given adequate attention and be considered important since the success of therapy depends on revealing of etiologic agents.
TI  - Comparative bactericidal activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates resistant to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The bactericidal activity of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin and norfloxacin against clinical isolates conventionally classified as resistant to fluoroquinolones were compared at their maximum concentrations in serum, urine (except moxifloxacin) and bronchial mucosa (except norfloxacin). Time killing curves against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were performed. Serum concentrations of the tested drugs were not able to produce a bactericidal effect on fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. In the urine series, levofloxacin was always bactericidal (decrease > or = 3 logs CFU/ml), while norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were bactericidal on E. coli (both), P. mirabilis (norfloxacin) and P. aeruginosa (ciprofloxacin). In the bronchial mucosa series, S. pneumoniae was rapidly killed by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and K. pneumoniae by levofloxacin after 12 hours. In conclusion, the maximum levofloxacin concentrations achievable at certain body sites allowed killing even of strains defined as resistant by conventional breakpoints.
TI  - Amoxicillin-sulbactam: A clinical and therapeutic review.
AB  - Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors with penicillins, especially aminopenicillins, have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the common pathogens of the respiratory and urinary tracts. This means that they are an ideal treatment for infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, special cases of pharyngeal tonsillitis (recurring forms, indirect pathogenic action, or after the failure of amoxicillin monotherapy), acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, cystitis, urethritis, etc. The amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is active against both beta-lactamase producer and nonproducer strains, and is effective against Gram-positive cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus of nonhospital origin), Gram-negative cocci (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis and others), Gram-negative bacilli (nonhospital strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and others) and anaerobes. Its antimicrobial activity means that it is indicated in the treatment of respiratory, ear, nose and throat, urinary, dermatological and gynecological infections caused by susceptible germs, as well as in a variety of surgical situations (both as a treatment and as prophylaxis). It is absorbed very well orally, and its pharmacokinetic profile is very favorable, with very good tissue penetration. It is reasonably well tolerated: in a variable percentage of cases it may cause modification of intestinal transit and/or fecal consistency, which usually abates spontaneously. The new formulation for administration at intervals of 12 h is easier to use, is better tolerated and favors completion of therapy. In summary, the amoxicillin-sulbactam combination is effective and well tolerated in most infections of nonhospital origin in adults and children. (c) 2001 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - [Cefepime (maxipime), large spectrum 4th generation cephalosporin, resistant to beta-lactamases].
AB  - As a result of the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to 3rd generation cephlosporin, since 1993 cephalosporins of 4th generation have been developed and introduced in therapy; among them are: cefepime and cefpirome. Cefepime is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin possessing the following advantages over the 3rd generation cephalosporins: high intrinsic potency due to rapid penetration into the periplasmic space; an extended spectrum of activity that includes many Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; Activity against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter and Klebsiella species; Low potential for beta-lactamase induction, especially Bush group 1 beta-lactamases, even ar low periplasmic concentrations; Minimal selection of resistant mutant strains. Its spectrum is very large being very active against Gram-negative bacilii: Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia, Citrobacter, Proteus mirabilis and less active against Bacillus fragillis. Cefepime is also very active against Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains only), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Some of the methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus are susceptible to cefepime; Enterococcus is resistant. Due to its high resistance against beta-lactamases Cefepime (Maxipime) is the best choice in life threatening nosocomial infections occuring in patients in the intensive care units. Cefepime can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones.
TI  - [Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment efficacy in surgical patients ].
AB  - Between September and December 2001 in the "Caritas" Surgical Clinic of Bucharest has been conducted a clinical study for the efficiency of Cefepime (Maxipime) treatment in surgical patients. Introduced in therapy in the last decade of the XXth Century, Cefepime (Maxipime) is the most active 4th generation cephalosporin, due to its extended spectrum of activity and its high resistance against beta-lactamases. Cefepime (Maxipime) has a very large spectrum, including the majority of the microorganisms implicated in surgical infections: Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae/speciae, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus fragillis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia, Citrobacter and other Gram-negative bacilii, Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes). The clinical study included 30 surgical patients, the selection criteria being the severity of the present infection or the potential risk after major (abdominal) surgery. We introduced Cefepime (Maxipime) as first choice of monotheraphy, except: severe, life threatening nosocomial infections, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; failure of another antibiotheraphy schema, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with aminoglycosides; suspicion of anaerobe contamination, when we associated Cefepime (Maxipime) with metronidazole. The results of our study support the utilization of Cefepime (Maxipime) as the best choice antibiotic in severe surgical infections, especially in the intensive care and surgical units. Cefepime (Maxipime) can be synergically associated with aminoglycosides and imidazoles (metronidazole).
TI  - Pathogen of occurrence and susceptibility patterns associated with pneumonia in hospitalized patients in North America: results of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Study (2000).
AB  - Antimicrobial selection for patients diagnosed with pneumonia is a major therapeutic challenge and dilemma to the clinical practitioner. In the community setting, patients usually receive empiric oral therapy based upon multiple patient risk factors and locally prevalent pathogen susceptibilities. For patients admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, or who acquire pneumonia while in the hospital, therapy can be initially empiric and then become directed once culture and susceptibility results are known. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program since 1997, has monitored pathogen frequency and antimicrobial susceptibilities in hospitalized patients with pneumonia in North America. In this Study 2,712 pathogens were studied from 30 medical centers (25 in the United States and 5 in Canada). Over 30 species of organisms were recovered with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 28.0% of all isolates and with four other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.0%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9.1%, Klebsiella spp. 7.5% and Haemophilus influenzae 7.3%) constituted 71.9% of isolates submitted. Methicillin (oxacillin)-resistant S. aureus accounted for 43.7% of all S. aureus isolates. Antimicrobials demonstrating significant (>80%) activity against S. aureus were: chloramphenicol (81.6%), tetracycline (91.4%), rifampin (96.4%) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (99.7%); and no isolate was resistant to glycopeptides or linezolid. North American isolates of P. aeruginosa were most susceptible to amikacin (93.7%) > tobramycin (90.2%) > meropenem (89.1%) > imipenem = piperacillin/tazobactam (85.6%) > piperacillin (82.1%) > cefepime (80.5%). Overall, 32.1% of S. pneumoniae were penicillin non-susceptible while erythromycin susceptibility was only 74.8%. Fluoroquinolones and recent generation cephalosporins retained excellent activity (gatifloxacin [99.2%] > levofloxacin = cefepime [98.8%] > ceftriaxone [97.2%]) against S. pneumoniae. Klebsiella spp. were 100.0% susceptible to the carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem) but extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected at a rate of 5.4%. The beta-lactamase-positive rate in H. influenzae was 28.6% in North America (71.4% ampicillin-susceptible). The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program continues to identify important North American patterns of pathogen frequency and resistance. Additionally, the provision of multi-year longitudinal data and associated reports allow for comparisons, which function as critical tools for effective patient management and antimicrobial interventions.
TI  - In vitro activity of 10 antimicrobial agents against bacteria isolated from cows  with clinical mastitis.
AB  - The susceptibility of 495 strains of bacteria, recently isolated in France from cows with clinical mastitis, to 10 antimicrobial agents--penicillin G, cloxacillin, oxacillin, cephalexin, cefazolin, cephapirin, cefquinome, neomycin, ampicillin and colistin--was determined by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICS). Overall, the levels of resistance were very low except for staphylococci and penicillin G. The 167 streptococcal strains were susceptible to all of the beta-lactams tested, but six (3-6 per cent) were highly resistant to neomycin. Of the 171 staphylococcal isolates, 36.2 per cent were resistant to penicillin G, one strain of Staphylococcus sciuri was classified as methicillin-resistant, but they were all susceptible to neomycin. None of the 122 strains of Escherichia coli was resistant to colistin, but 12 had high MIC values for one or more of the cephalosporins.
TI  - National surveillance programme on susceptibility patterns of respiratory pathogens in South Africa: moxifloxacin compared with eight other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - AIMS: The susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from specimens submitted to 12 private laboratories in South Africa were determined. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determinations were performed on the isolates in the microbiology laboratory at Tygerberg Hospital according to the recommendations of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: According to the NCCLS breakpoints, 24% of 729 S pneumoniae isolates were sensitive, 30% intermediate, and 46% resistant to penicillin. Rates of macrolide resistance were high, with 61% of the pneumococci being resistant to clarithromycin and azithromycin. Co-trimoxazole resistance was also high, with 28% of pneumococcal strains being sensitive, 21% intermediate, and 51% resistant. beta Lactamase was produced by 7% of 736 H influenzae isolates and 91% of 256 M catarrhalis isolates. The quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were universally active against all isolates tested, which included S pneumoniae, H influenzae, M catarrhalis, K pneumoniae, and S pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilus influenzae and S pneumoniae were the most commonly isolated organisms. Resistance to penicillin was one of the highest reported in the world (76%) in S pneumoniae, as was macrolide resistance in pneumonocci, although surprisingly, only 14% of S pyogenes were resistant. The quinolones, moxifloxacin and levofloxacin, were active against all organisms tested, including the penicillin and macrolide resistant strains and moxifloxacin was more active than levofloxacin against pneumococci.
TI  - Causes and outcome of young infant admissions to a Kenyan district hospital.
AB  - AIMS: To provide a comprehensive description of young infant admissions to a first referral level health facility in Kenya. These data, currently lacking, are important given present efforts to standardise their care through the integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) and for prioritising both health care provision and disease prevention strategies. METHODS: Prospective, 18 month observational study in a Kenyan district hospital of all admissions less than 3 months of age to the paediatric ward. RESULTS: A total of 1080 infants were studied. Mortality was 18% overall, though in those aged 0-7 days it was 34%. Within two months of discharge a further 5% of infants aged <60 days on admission had died. Severe infection and prematurity together accounted for 57% of inpatient deaths in those aged <60 days, while jaundice and tetanus accounted for another 27%. S pneumoniae, group B streptococcus, E coli, and Klebsiella spp. were the most common causes of invasive bacterial disease. Hypoxaemia, hypoglycaemia, and an inability to feed were each present in more than 20% of infants aged 0-7 days. Both hypoxaemia and the inability to feed were associated with inpatient death (OR 3.8 (95% CI 2.5 to 5.8) and 7.4 (95% CI 4.8 to 11.2) respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Young infants contribute substantially to paediatric inpatient mortality at the first referral level, highlighting the need both for basic supportive care facilities and improved disease prevention strategies.
TI  - Colonization of burn wounds in Ain Shams University Burn Unit.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 70 burned patients admitted to the Burn Unit, Ain Shams University Hospital, Cairo, with the aim to verify the pattern of microbial colonization of burn wounds. Throughout the study period starting from 1 June 1999 till 31 May 2001, 281 sampling procedures (surface swabs) were performed from the burn wounds. A total of 301 microbial isolates were grown in cultures. Eight different species of bacteria, and only one species of Candida (C. albicans) were detected. There was no incidence of recovery of anaerobic microorganisms. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.6%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.2%), then Escherichia coli (13.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (11.6%), Streptococcus pyogenes (8.3%), Enterobacter species (6.6%), and lastly Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans (5.9 and 3.6%, respectively). Studying the time-related changes in burn wound microbial colonization showed an initial predominance of gram-positive cocci upon admission (70.7%) over gram-negative bacilli (27.6%). During the first 5 days, gram-negative bacilli started to predominate (55.7%) over gram-positive cocci (40.3%). Burn wound sampling performed starting from the sixth day onwards, revealed further prevalence of gram-negative bacilli (72.7%) over gram-positive cocci (22.7%). As for Candida albicans, there was a gradual increase in the frequency of its recovery as time elapsed from admission. It is crucial for every burn institution to determine the specific pattern of burn wound microbial colonization, the time-related changes in the dominant flora, and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This would enable early treatment of imminent septic episodes with proper empirical systemic antibiotics, without waiting for culture results, thus improving the overall infection-related morbidity and mortality.
TI  - Microbiology and management of acute suppurative thyroiditis in children.
AB  - This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of suppurative thyroiditis (ST). Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, are the predominant aerobic isolates. The most common anaerobic bacteria are Gram-negative bacilli and Peptostreptococcus spp. Agents that are rarely recovered include Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, Aspergillus spp., Coccidioides immitis, Candida spp., Treponema pallidum, and Echinococcus spp. Viruses have been associated with subacute thyroiditis, and include measles, mumps, influenza, enterovirus Epstein-barr, adenovirus, echovirus, and St Louis encephalitis. Therapy includes administration of antibiotics effective against the causative pathogen(s). Proper selection of therapy can be guided by culture of the lesion. Surgical drainage may be necessary in case of suppuration.
TI  - Adult community acquired bacterial meningitis in a Singaporean teaching hospital. A seven-year overview (1993-2000).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study is to describe the bacteriological, clinical and laboratory features of community acquired bacterial meningitis in adults admitted to a Singapore tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-nine cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis admitted between 1993 and 2000 were identified by their discharge diagnosis codes. All case records except for 57 which could not be retrieved were retrospectively reviewed. Patients less than 14 years or with skull fractures, post-neurosurgery or with indwelling intracranial devices were excluded. Inclusion criteria was a clinical picture compatible with a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis with either (1) positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cultures or latex coagglutination or CSF neutrophilic pleocytosis accompanied by positive blood cultures or (2) in the absence of positive blood cultures, CSF cultures and latex agglutination, presence of CSF pleocytosis of at least 100 neutrophils per microL. RESULTS: Fifteen "culture-positive" and 11 "culture negative" cases were identified. Six (55%) of the "culture-negative" cases received antibiotics prior to admission. Cultures grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in four cases, three cases each of Group B streptococci and Neisseria meningitides. Listeria monocytogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae were each seen twice and Streptococcus suis once. All cases of Group B streptococci occurred in the year 1998. Mortality was 19% (n = 5), six developed infections in other sites, three epileptic seizures, three developed hydrocephalus, and two hearing loss. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens are similar to those reported in other studies but for an outbreak of Group B Streptococcus in 1998. There were a high number of "culture-negative" cases which may be due to preceding antibiotic intervention.
TI  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae in children with pneumonia at Mbagathi District Hospital, Nairobi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of mycoplasma pneumoniae in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children under five years of age suffering from pneumonia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Two primer sets targeting the genes coding for adhesion protein and 16S rRNA were used in PCR and M. pneumoniae specific antibodies were detected using commercial article agglutination kit. Microbiological investigations to isolate common acute respiratory infectious pathogens were also carried out. RESULTS: M. pneumoniae was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates of 33.7% of the cases by PCR while serology was positive in only 4.1%. M. pneumoniae alone (single detection) was detected in 25% of the cases while 75% occurred with other acute respiratory infectious (ARI) pathogens. However, the results did not correlate with clinical outcome or the severity of pneumonia. No significant aetiology was found in 28% of the cases investigated, however microbiological investigations by culture revealed the presence of other aetiological agents as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (26%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%), Staphylococcus aureus (3%), E. coli (2%), parainfluenza viruses (5%), Salmonella(1%), adenovirus (4%), RSV (22%) and Candida spp(13%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was more prevalent in children aged between six months and three years. Cases of M. pneumoniae PCR positive and S. pneumoniae exhibited similar seasonal distribution with peaks in May and September. However, there was no relationship between M. pneumoniae PCR positive and the severity of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: More investigation is required to establish the significance of atypical pathogens in respiratory infections in Kenya.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/mL, which were similar to those in the studies before its marketing. In this study, CPDX showed the decrease in the activity against several species as did other drugs tested, but against most of species tested, CPDX maintained good activity. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].
AB  - As the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (Carbenin), MICs of panipenem (PAPM) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEPM), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. The activity of PAPM was comparable to that of IPM against almost all species tested. Compared with MEPM, PAPM was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp., and less active against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the parenteral cephems, PAPM was more active against most of species tested and its MIC ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. In this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli, 3.4% for ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against these resistant strains, carbapenems including PAPM showed generally more potent activity than cephems. It was noted that PAPM showed the most potent activity against PISP and PRSP, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. Metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and BLNAR H. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. But no remarkable change in the activity of PAPM against other species was observed in this study compared with that in the studies before the marketing of Carbenin. Furthermore, it is necessary to pay much attention to the trend of resistant strains such as PRSP, metallo-beta-lactamase producing bacteria, and BLNAR H. influenzae.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of gatifloxacin against various fresh clinical isolates in 2002].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of gatifloxacin (GFLX) and other antibacterial drugs against various fresh clinical strains (800 isolates) isolated from specimens of patients in 2002 were compared. GFLX was more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria such as methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. For these isolates, clarithromycin and azithromycin were less active (MIC90; > 16- > 64 micrograms/mL), GFLX was more active than cefdinir. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter species, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, three quinolones including GFLX were potently active (MIC90; < or = 0.06-0.5 microgram/mL). Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from urinary tract infections were resistant to three quinolones including GFLX (MIC90; 32-64 micrograms/mL), however P. aeruginosa isolated from respiratory and otolaryngological infections were more susceptible (MIC90; 0.5-2 micrograms/mL). Quinolones were less active against Neisseria gonorrhoeae as compared with the cephem antibiotics tested, but GFLX was the most active against N. gonorrhoeae among the quinolones tested. In this study, we investigated activity of GFLX against fresh clinical strains isolated early in 2002, GFLX is widely and potently active against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and various Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of prulifloxacin, a new oral fluoroquinolone].
AB  - We compared antibacterial activity of NM394, which is the active metabolite of a  prodrug of new fluoroquinolone prulifloxacin (PUFX), against clinical isolates of bacteria with those of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), levofloxacin (LVFX), gatifloxacin (GFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX) and fleroxacin (FLRX). 1. NM394 showed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. 2. MIC80 of NM394 for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 microgram/ml, 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 of NM394 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was lower than 0.06 microgram/ml. MIC80 of NM394 for Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.25 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 against P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, GFLX, LVFX and TFLX. 4. Short-time bactericidal activity of NM394 at Cmax concentration against 12 strains of P. aeruginosa was stronger than those of CPFX, LVFX, GFLX and TFLX.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1999 and March 2000].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. In this paper, the results obtained in the academic year 1999 (from April 1999 to March 2000) have been summarized. Two hundred seven cases were investigated, and 411 strains were isolated from 169 cases (81.6%). Of those strains, 184 and 227 strains were from primary infections and postoperative infections, respectively. In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes, Streptococcus spp., and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes were higher than in primary infections. Staphylococcus aureus were most frequently isolated among Gram-positive aerobes, Peptostreptococcus prevotii among Gram-positive anaerobes, E. coli among Gram-negative aerobes, and Bacteroides fragilis among Gram-negative anaerobes. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes, which gradually increased by the year 1998, decreased in the year 1999. The percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes increased, while that of Gram-negative bacteria was equivalent to that in the last year. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes, which continuously increased after the year 1990, decreased, while that of Gram-positive aerobes, which decreased in the last year, increased. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus accounted for 70.7% of S. aureus (41 strains). Either the number of strain or the percentage of MRSA decreased. The susceptibilities of E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased against third and forth generation cephems, oxacephems, and monobactams. The susceptibilities of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems tend to decrease after the year 1997. S. aureus showed good susceptibilities to the tested drugs including arbekacin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Cairo, Egypt 1999-2000: a survey of five hospitals.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens is a global problem, but in Egypt data are sparse. We reviewed the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli in five hospitals in Cairo, Egypt, from 1999 to 2000. In addition, susceptibilities of non-bloodstream isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. were analysed. High rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. In the hospitals, a variety of methods were used for identification and susceptibility testing, but in the laboratories quality controlled strains were utilized routinely, to ensure accurate performance of the assays. Only 29% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates and 23% of coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates were oxacillin susceptible. Both groups of staphylococci were also highly resistant to erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, clindamycin and doxycycline; all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. Susceptibility of S. pneumoniae isolates to penicillin, ceftriaxone and fluoroquinolones was 63%, 84% and 82%, respectively. Vancomycin susceptibility of the enterococci was 96%; susceptibility to high-level gentamicin and streptomycin was 54% and 48%, respectively. Resistance to most relevant antimicrobials was commonplace among the Gram-negative bacilli; however, most remained susceptible to imipenem. The percentage of bloodstream isolates of Escherichia coli susceptible to common antimicrobial agents was as follows: ampicillin (6%), ampicillin-sulbactam (38%), co-trimoxazole (38%) and aminoglycosides (52%). The susceptibility of isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. to ceftazidime was 62%, 40% and 46%, respectively. This suggests a potentially high rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and/or Amp-C enzyme production. These results call for a nationwide surveillance programme to monitor microbial trends and antimicrobial resistance patterns in Egypt.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Investigation on the antibacterial properties of garlic (Allium sativum) on pneumonia causing bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the crude aqueous extract of garlic was investigated against some pneumonia causing bacteria by an agar dilution technique. The results revealed that Streptococcus pneumoniae standard test organism was completely inhibited by 7.8 mg/ml of media and the clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae was completely inhibited by 24.38 mg/ml of media, indicating that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most sensitive and Klebsiella pneumoniae the least. Garlic could be used as an effective antibacterial agent for these pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Naturally occurring immune response against bacteria commonly involved in upper respiratory tract infections: analysis of the antigen-specific salivary IgA levels.
AB  - Lyophilized bacterial lysates, which actively stimulate the immune response, are  widely used as vaccines or 'biological response modifiers' in subjects with recurrent bacterial respiratory infections. Since vaccines are indicated in the absence or in the presence of a weak constitutive immune response activity, a better knowledge on the 'naturally' occurring antibacterial immune response at the oropharingeal level should be helpful. A study was, therefore, designed to quantify the presence of salivary IgA directed against surface antigens bacteria frequently involved in the pathogenesis of upper respiratory tract infections: Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Streptococcus pyogenes (SPy), Morraxella catarrhalis (MC), Haemophylus influenzae (HI), and Streptococcus pnumoniae (SPn). In 34 volunteers (21 adults and 13 children), salivary fluid was collected and the presence of microorganism-specific IgA antibodies evaluated by a novel enzyme immuno-assay. In the whole population only 29 and 24% of subjects had IgA directed, respectively, to KP and SA, while the immune-response against other microbes was detectable in a small population ranging from 12 to 15% of all subjects studied. We found higher proportions of individuals with strain specific salivary IgA in the adult than in the pediatric population for all the microorganism evaluated. In addition, in children, the only strain inducing a significant production of specific IgA at oropharingeal level was KP. Interestingly, only ten out of 21 adults and two out 13 children have at least one significantly high antibody titer against one of the bacteria evaluated. Nevertheless, when a group of healthy donors was treated with a polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (Ismigen t.), the large majority developed a specific immune-response in the salivary fluid. These results are thus consistent with the good features of the novel enzyme-immunoassay and with a poor frequency of naturally induced specific anti-microbe antibodies in children and in adults despite the presence on recurrent respiratory infections in their clinical history.
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) and other areas of the hospital such as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. The problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised patient. Multi-drug resistance is common among both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). Two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). When infections occur with ESBL-KP, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. When infection occurs with VRE, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. Two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against VR-E. faecium. Risk factors for the development of ESBL-KP include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. Risk factors for the development of VRE include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. Several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy of infections. For VRE, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.
TI  - [Second multicenter study of the in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam].
AB  - A study was conducted in 1999 on the activity of piperacillin-tazobactam on 1349  strains collected in a Spanish multicenter study involving 10 hospitals. A total of 897 Gram-negative bacteria of the following genuses were collected: Escherichia coli (169), Klebsiella spp. (112), Pseudomonas spp. (122), Enterobacter spp. (92), Serratia spp. (44), Citrobacter spp. (37), Proteus spp. (114), Morganella spp. (49), Acinetobacter spp. (47), Stenotrophomonas spp. (47), Haemophilus spp. (45), Moraxella spp. (19). The Gram-positive bacteria included Staphylococcus aureus (116), Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), and Enterococcus spp. (114). Piperacillin-tazobactam activity against different anaerobic bacteria was also determined: Bacteroides spp. (88), Clostridium spp. (25), Prevotella spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Peptosteptococcus spp. (9). The piperacillin-tazobactam combination was found to maintain its activity against the isolated microorganisms with regard to the previous study.
TI  - [Pathogen variance and drug-sensibility analysis of lower-respiratory-tract bacterial infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease].
AB  - We contrastively analyzed pathogens and their drug sensibilities of lower-respiratory-tract infection in chronic pulmonary heart disease in two different periods. The results were that the Gram-positive cocci (GPC) was 43.8% and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) was 56.2% in Group A (1985-1990); GPC was 24.6% and GNB was 75.4% in Group B (1995-2000). The predominant bacteria were in the following order: Preudomonas (21.9%), pneumococcal (18.8%), streptococcus (10.9%), acinetobacter (9.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.8%), and klebsiella (7.8%) in Group A; and preudomonas (30.7%), acinetobacter (12.3%), staphylococcus epidermidis (12.3%), klebsiella (10.5%), enteric bacilli (7.0%), and staphylococcus aureus (7.0%) in Group B. The results suggest that GNB is the main pathogen in recent years; sensibility of most drugs in the 1990s fell in varying degrees compared with that in the 1980s, but antibacterial in common use is still available.
TI  - Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  - The parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. The most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are Staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp.), Fusobacterium spp., and Peptostreptococcus spp. Streptococcus spp. (including S. pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including Escherichia coli) have also been reported. Gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. Organisms less frequently found are Arachnia, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and Eikenella corrodens. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. Therapy includes maintenance of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. The choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. Maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (2000)].
AB  - From October 2000 to September 2001, we collected the specimen from 410 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 16 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various anti-bacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 499 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 493 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 73, Haemophilus infiuenzae 99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 64, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae 25, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 21, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or more of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 53.8%. Vancomycin and arbekacin had the most potent activities against MRSA as observed in 1999. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) was 38.4% being consistent with that in 1999 (34.7%). PRSP accounted for 11.0% of the total, being more than that in 1999 (3.0%). Carbapenems had strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 73 strains at 0.125 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs had strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or less. The drug that had the strongest activity against H. infiuenzae was levofloxacin, which inhibited the growth of 94 of the 99 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Tobramycin had a strong activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. The mucoid strain was little isolated (14 strains) but the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than the non-mucoid strain. K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except ampicillin and the MIC80S were 2 micrograms/ml or less. Particularly, cefpirome, cefozopran, and levofloxacin had strong bactericidal activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml, and cefotiam, second-generation cephems, also had a favorable activity being MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, all drugs generally had strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or less. The drug having the strongest activity was imipenem and levofloxacin inhibiting all 21 strains at 0.063 microgram/ml. Most of the patients with respiratory infection were aged 70 years or older, accounting for approximately a half of the total (44.4%). As for the incidence by the diseases, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest, being noted in 38.0% and 31.7% of all the patients, respectively. The bacteria frequently isolated from the patients with bacterial pneumonia were S. aureus (18.3%) and S. pneumoniae (16.1%). In contrast, H. infiuenzae (20.4%) and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid: 16.7%) were frequently isolated from the patients with chronic bronchitis. Before the drug administration, the bacteria frequently isolated from all the patients were S. pneumoniae (24.3%) and H. infiuenzae (26.7%). The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae tended to decrease with the increase in the number of administration days while that of isolated H. infiuenzae did not. The frequency of isolated P. aeruginosa tended to increase with the duration of administration. The isolated bacteria were comparable between the patients already treated with penicillins and cephems. In the patients treated with aminoglycosides, macrolides, and quinolones, P. aeruginosa was most frequently isolated (33.3 to 40.0%).
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Bacterial resistance: origins, epidemiology, and impact.
AB  - The basic mechanisms of antibacterial resistance are well known, but critical new aspects continue to be discovered. Recently discovered factors with major implications for the emergence, dissemination, and maintenance of resistance include multidrug efflux, hypermutability, integrons, and plasmid addiction. Some resistances are widespread and others local, with prevalence rates often worst in newly prosperous countries and in those specialist units where antibacterial use is heaviest. Multidrug-resistant epidemic strains are critical to the total accumulation of resistance (e.g., among Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae), but it remains unclear why some bacterial lineages achieve epidemic spread whereas others that are equally resistant do not. The correlation between in vitro resistance and treatment failure is imperfect, but resistance undoubtedly increases mortality, morbidity, and costs in many settings. Recent concern has led to a plethora of governmental and agency reports advocating less antibacterial use, better antibacterial use, better infection control, and the development of new antibacterials. The evidence that better prescribing can reduce resistance rates is mixed, and although changes to hospital regimens may reduce one resistance problem, other opportunistic bacteria may fill the vacant niche. Overall, the best that can reasonably be anticipated is an improved balance between the accumulation of resistance and new antibacterial development.
TI  - [Dynamics of antibiotic resistance of purulent septic pathogens at an emergency facility].
AB  - The predominant pathogens at the emergency medicine hospital were analysed and its resistance to antibiotics was investigated in dynamics. The susceptibility of the pathogens was analysed by the method of dynamic equalibration. Statistically significant reduction of resistant bacteria isolation was demonstrated for 2 species of 7--that is S. aureus and E. faecalis regarding 4 antibiotics. The ratio of staphylococci resistant to cefazolin, ceftazidime, doxycyclin reduced, the ratio of enterococci resistant to chloramphenicol and doxycyclin also diminished. No correlation was demonstrated between the pathogen isolation frequency and ratio of resistant strains.
TI  - Aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia in children admitted to a paediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the aetiological agents and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) in children admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An audit was done after a protocol was implemented to identify the aetiological agents in children with life-threatening SCAP admitted to the PICU from the emergency room. The following investigations were done as per protocol: blood culture, culture of the tracheal aspirate, immunofluorescence and culture of the nasopharyngeal aspirate, microscopy and culture of the gastric juice for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and determination of HIV status. The following data, documented prospectively, were obtained from patient records: date of admission, age, gender, weight, duration of ventilation, duration of stay in the PICU, survival or death, and severity of illness as determined by means of the score for acute neonatal physiology (SNAP) or paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) score depending on the child's age. RESULTS: Twenty-three children were admitted over a 1-year period (1 November 1994-30 October 1995). Their median age was 10 weeks (range 2 weeks-5 years) and the sex distribution was equal. Two children were HIV-infected. Twenty children received mechanical ventilation for a median period of 6.5 days (range 2-16 days). Aetiological agents were identified in 15/23 children (65%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen, identified in 7/23 children, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacterial pathogen, identified in 5 children (2 blood cultures and 3 tracheal aspirates). Tuberculosis was not diagnosed. The mean PRISM score was similar in survivors and children who died. The case fatality rate was 30%. The 7 children who died had a median arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio of 94 (range 32-111) and the 16 survivors had a median ratio of 146 (range 51-252) (P = 0.01) on admission. Both HIV-infected children died and postmortem examination showed a pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii and cytomegalovirus. CONCLUSIONS: SCAP occurs in very young children. One or more pathogens were isolated in 65% of cases. Viral pathogens predominated, with RSV being the most common. The yield of positive blood cultures was low at 17%. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were not found. The case fatality rate was 30% and death was more likely with a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio on admission.
TI  - Four-year evaluation of frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility  patterns of bacteria from bloodstream infections in Latin American medical centers.
AB  - As part of the Latin American arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 7,207 bacterial isolates collected consecutively from bloodstream infections (BSI) during the period of January 1997 through December 2000 were analyzed. Ten Latin American laboratories located in six countries participated in the study during each year. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the reference NCCLS broth microdilution method. The most frequently isolated species were (n/%): Staphylococcus aureus (1,532/21.3%), Escherichia coli (1,239/17.2%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (1,002/13.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (664/9.2%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (470/6.5%). The prevalence of S. aureus as a cause of BSI increased from 20.5% in 1997 to 23.3% in 2000 (p = 0.011), but oxacillin-resistance rates remained relatively stable during this period (around 30%). Enterococci (216 isolates) showed low rates of resistance to both vancomycin (2.4%) and ampicillin (7.9%) and 72.7% of 289 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates evaluated were susceptible to penicillin (MIC </=0.06 microg/mL). Resistance rates among Gram-negative bacilli were much higher than those reported in other regions evaluated in the SENTRY Program. The main antimicrobial resistance problems among these pathogens were the high prevalences of ESBL-producing E. coli (6.7%) and K. pneumoniae (47.3%), and carbapenem-resistance among P. aeruginosa (around 12%) and Acinetobacter spp. (around 10%). P. aeruginosa resistance rates to meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin showed a significant increase during the 4-year period evaluated. Resistance rates varied according to the country for several pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. In summary, resistance to most antimicrobial agents for a number of species implicated in bacteremia, especially among Gram-negative rods, has reached worrisome levels and continues to increase.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against recent clinical isolates of bacteria in Korea.
AB  - Gemifloxacin is an enhanced-affinity fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In Korea, resistant bacteria are relatively more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. In this study, we studied the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and other commonly used antimicrobial agents against 1,689 bacterial strains isolated at four Korean university hospitals during 1999-2000. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the agar dilution method of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Gemifloxacin had the lowest MICs for the respiratory pathogens: 90% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by 0.06, 0.03, and 0.03 mg/L, respectively. Gemifloxacin was more active than the other fluoroquinolones against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis. The MIC90s of gemifloxacin for Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, and non-typhoidal Salmonella spp. were 0.25, 1.0, and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, while those for other Gram-negative bacilli were 4-64 mg/L. In conclusion, gemifloxacin was the most active among the comparative agents against Gram-positive species, including respiratory pathogens isolated in Korea.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 16 acutely infected and 7 chronically infected sphenoid sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 29 isolates were recovered from the 16 cases of acute sphenoid sinusitis (1.8 per specimen): 22 aerobic and facultative (1.4 per specimen), and 7 anaerobic (0.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 10 specimens (62%), anaerobes alone were isolated in 3 (19%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 3 (19%). The predominant aerobic and facultative species were Staphylococcus aureus (9 isolates), Streptococcus spp (9), and Haemophilus influenzae (2). A total of 28 isolates were recovered from the 7 cases of chronic sphenoid sinusitis (4.0 per specimen): 11 aerobic and facultative (1.6 per specimen) and 17 anaerobic (2.4 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in I instance (14%), anaerobes alone in 3 instances (43%), and mixed aerobes and anaerobes in 3 instances (43%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 1 each). The predominant anaerobes included Peptostreptococcus spp (4 isolates), Prevotella spp (5), and Fusobacterium spp (4). These findings illustrate the unique microbiology of acute and chronic sphenoid sinusitis.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - Listeria monocytogenes-induced monomicrobial non-neutrocytic bacterascites.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The organisms most commonly involved in this infection are gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and gram-positive bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. Listeria monocytogenes is an uncommon gram-positive bacillus implicated in infections in neonates, pregnant females, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. Listeria monocytogene-induced SBP is rare, with less than 40 cases reported in the medical literature. Monobacterial non-neutrocytic bacterascites (MNB) is a variant of SBP, where the ascitic fluid culture is positive but the ascitic neutrophil count is less than 250/mm3. Forty percent of these patients will subsequently have SBP. Only 2 cases of MNB from L monocytogenes have previously been reported. We report a case of MNB in a patient with cirrhosis whose ascitic neutrophil count was 164/mm', but Gram stain and microbiologic culture showed the growth of L monocytogenes.
TI  - Infestation of fish-culturing communities with fish-borne bacteria: the Ghanaian  case.
AB  - Twenty different bacterial species were isolated from fishermen and members of communities associated with seven fish ponds with different fertilizer treatments, and an open system. The number and types of the bacterial species were different for the different ponds. Generally, neither the geographical location of the ponds nor the type of fertilizer used could be related to the bacterial flora. Escherichia coli was the predominant species in all the communities, while Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas sp., Shigella sp. or Streptococcus faecalis were common in individuals of communities of sewage-fed pond.
TI  - Moxifloxacin activity against clinical isolates compared with the activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The activity of moxifloxacin, a new 8-methoxyquinolone, was compared in vitro with the activity of ciprofloxacin against clinical strains isolated from various sites of infection. The mode MIC values of moxifloxacin were superior to those of ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter spp., while ciprofloxacin was more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas spp. Both antibiotics had similar activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against recent community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens isolated in France: a national survey.
AB  - Between February and June 2000, 2345 consecutive strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from 2088 adult patients suffering from community-acquired respiratory tract infections, in 97 hospital laboratories. Of the 1037 S. pneumoniae isolates, 48.3% were intermediately or highly penicillin resistant. For invasive isolates, the MIC90s of penicillin G, amoxycillin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, erythromycin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin were 2, 2, 4, 0.5, 1024, 2, 2 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. All but one invasive strain were susceptible to moxifloxacin whereas 97.5% were susceptible to levofloxacin. The MIC90s of clinical isolates with intermediate susceptibility or high resistance to penicillin G, were 2, 2, 4, 1, 1024, 2, 2 and 0.25 mg/l. About 98.1, 97.0, and 83.1% of strains were inhibited by concentrations < or = 1 mg/l of moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively (E-test). Eight of the 1037 S. pneumoniae strains were not susceptible to moxifloxacin and had mutations in gyrA (eight strains), parC (four strains) or parE (three strains). Against H. influenzae (32.7% were beta-lactamase producers) and M. catarrhalis (96.3% were beta-lactamase producers), the MIC90s of moxifloxacin, amoxycillin and co-amoxiclav were 0.094 and 0.125 mg/l, 64 and 8 mg/l, and 1.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Against oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, the MIC90s of moxifloxacin were 0.125 and 0.84 mg/l respectively. Moxifloxacin had the highest in vitro activity of all antibiotics tested.
TI  - Intravitreal penetration of cefepime after systemic administration to humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) into the vitreous after single-dose intravenous administration to human subjects. METHODS: Thirty phakic patients about to undergo vitreous surgery received 1 g (group 1, 15 patients) or 2 g cefepime (group 2, 15 patients) in a single intravenous injection before surgery. The indications for vitreous surgery were retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (24 patients), retinal detachment associated with giant retinal tear (4 patients), macular hole (1 patient) and intraocular foreign body (1 patient). Samples of vitreous and serum were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 12 h after injection. Three patients were used for each sampling time and for 1 g and 2 g of cefepime. Samples were assayed for cefepime concentrations with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: All the patients had detectable cefepime in their vitreous and serum measurable by HPLC. The level of cefepime in the vitreous peaked at 2 h and reached a minimum at 12 h after intravenous injection in both groups. A mean peak vitreous level of cefepime was 1.91 +/- 0.13 microg/ml in group 1 and 2.86 +/- 0.37 microg/ml in group 2. The level of cefepime in the vitreous at 12 h after injection was 0.89 +/- 0.14 microg/ml in group 1 and 0.97 +/- 0.30 microg/ml in group 2. CONCLUSION: The vitreous level of cefepime after intravenous injection was below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC(90)) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but was over the MIC(90) against Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterobacter spp.
TI  - Recognition of bacterial capsular polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides by the  macrophage mannose receptor.
AB  - The in vitro binding of the macrophage mannose receptor to a range of different bacterial polysaccharides was investigated. The receptor was shown to bind to purified capsular polysaccharides from Streptococcus pneumoniae and to the lipopolysaccharides, but not capsular polysaccharides, from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Binding was Ca(2+)-dependent and inhibitable with d-mannose. A fusion protein of the mannose receptor containing carbohydrate recognition domains 4-7 and a full-length soluble form of the mannose receptor containing all domains external to the transmembrane region both displayed very similar binding specificities toward bacterial polysaccharides, suggesting that domains 4-7 are sufficient for recognition of these structures. Surprisingly, no direct correlation could be made between polysaccharide structure and binding to the mannose receptor, suggesting that polysaccharide conformation may play an important role in recognition. The full-length soluble form of the mannose receptor was able to bind simultaneously both polysaccharide via the carbohydrate recognition domains and sulfated oligosaccharide via the cysteine-rich domain. The possible involvement of the mannose receptor, either cell surface or soluble, in the innate and adaptive immune responses to bacterial polysaccharides is discussed.
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia--from medical technologist].
AB  - The main causative microorganisms of Community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Especially the causative microorganisms affecting whole body basic disease, persons of advanced age, and alcoholic patients are Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Aspergillus spp., Pneumocystis carinii and anaerobic bacteria. Other microorganisms involved in epidemic disease, action condition (travel around hot springs etc.) and pet breeding environments are Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pnumophila, Chlamydia spp., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and adeno virus. We suggest methods of advancing the microscopic and microbiological examination and report, and quickly obtaining clinical information and extracting the clinical specimen. We also describe the inspection method for a case "Legionella pneumonia" that was discussed during this symposium.
TI  - Intrapulmonary neutrophil apoptosis in a pig model of pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Apoptosis and necrosis are two distinct cell death modalities. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) play an important role in pneumonia and little information is available on whether these cells are cleared by necrosis or apoptosis. We therefore compared the proportion of apoptotic PMNL in lung tissues with and without pneumonia. In addition, the association of PMNL apoptosis and mechanical ventilation (MV) was investigated. METHODS: Samples obtained from a pig model developed to tracheobronchial stenting were analysed. Pneumonia was induced with that model in 10 animals (white-Landrace piglets, Pittman-Moore or Gottingen minipigs). Animals were sacrificed when clinical parameters of pneumonia became evident and 17 lung samples could be analysed for histologic evidence of pneumonia, growth of micro-organisms, and the apoptotic index (proportion of apoptotic PMNL over all PMNL in a 400-power field). In addition, lung samples (n = 7) from two pigs without stent implantation on mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h were studied. RESULTS: A total of 9/17 samples (53%) showed histologic evidence of pneumonia, 11/17 (65%) had significant bacterial growth (> 10(3) cfu/g), and 7/17 (41%) fulfilled both criteria. The apoptotic index was not significantly different in samples with and without histologic evidence of pneumonia (pneumonia: 25.3 +/- 6.1% vs. No pneumonia: 25.2 +/- 11.9%; 95%CI: -9.7 - 9.5, p = 0.989) or in samples with and without significant bacterial growth (significant bacterial growth: 23.5+/-9.3% vs. No significant bacterial growth: 28.5+/-8.2%; 95%CI: -4.6 - 16.7; p = 0.284). However, the apoptotic index was higher in samples of pigs, mechanically ventilated for more than 48 h, compared to the stent group (MV: 36.9+/-10.7% vs. Stent: 25.2 +/- 9.0%; 95% CI: -20.5 - -2.9; p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: In an animal model, the proportion of apoptotic PMNL was not different in lung samples with and without histologic or bacterial pneumonia. However, MV for more than 48 h was associated with a higher proportion of apoptotic PMNL in lung tissue. This study may be helpful for the understanding of the evolution of lung tissue damage induced by bacterial pneumonia and MV.
TI  - Profile of childhood meningitis in a hospital in South West Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern of meningitis in children admitted to King Faisal Military Hospital, Aseer region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the period 1987 to 2000. Particular emphasis was on Hemophilus influenzae meningitis. METHODS: All the patients between the age of one month and 13 years of age, who were diagnosed with meningitis during that period, using the International Classification of Disease 9 coding system, were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 43 cases of meningitis based on the cerebrospinal fluid results were found. The majority (74%) of these cases were less than 2 years of age. Twenty-four patients had a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. Fifteen of them (62.5%) were due to Hemophilus influenzae. The others were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group B Streptococcus. The remaining 19 patients had cerebrospinal fluid findings consistent with bacterial meningitis CONCLUSION: Meningitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, constitutes a large percentage of childhood meningitis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This increase is highly attributed to the lack of vaccination against this organism. We recommend introducing this vaccine as a part of the routine vaccination schedule for all children.
TI  - Epidemiology of neonatal meningitis in Qatar.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neonatal meningitis is responsible for thousands of neonatal deaths annually all over the world. Our study was conducted to determine the epidemiology, management and best preventive measures for neonatal meningitis in Qatar. METHODS: A retrospective study reviewed the records of bacterial meningitis patients under the age of one month. The study was carried out at Hamad Medical Hospital, the only hospital that provides health care at Qatar and the study period was between January 1998 to December 2000. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were included. Sixty percent of patients had early onset meningitis. Causative organisms were group B Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas species, Neisseria meningitidis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Flavibacterium meningococcus septicum. A bacterial resistance to the usual combination of ampicillin and gentamicin were noticed (as initial treatment before culture sensitivity results), which affected negatively on some patients. Complications of cerebral palsy, mental retardation and epilepsy occurred in 3 patients (23%). None of the patients died during the study period. CONCLUSION: Emphasis is placed on the importance of correct early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic therapy. It is suggested that the identification and appropriate treatment of any maternal bacterial infection is an important measure in preventing neonatal sepsis and meningitis.
TI  - Colonization of denture plaque by respiratory pathogens in dependent elderly.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the interactions between oral conditions and a number of prevalent systemic diseases. The morbidity and mortality of the dependent elderly that result from aspiration pneumonia have been recognized as a major geriatric health problem. The purpose of this study was to gain more information on the microflora of plaque on dentures and to assess the existence of oral infectious pathogens potentially causing the respiratory disease in the dependent elderly. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The denture bacterial flora of 50 dependent elderly were examined to identify microorganisms by the culture method. RESULTS: 18 species of microorganisms were detected in denture plaque in this study. A variety of pathogens with the potential to cause respiratory infection pathogens colonized on the dentures of dependent elderly. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study revealed that bacteria that commonly cause respiratory infection colonized on the dentures of dependent elderly, suggesting that denture plaque may function as a reservoir of potential respiratory pathogens to facilitate colonization on the oropharynx.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  - Between January 1986 and December 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. To compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). In this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. Its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. Of the pathogens, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by Viridans (V.) streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Other rare organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella Group B and D, Proteus mirabilis, Group B, D, and non-A, non-B and non-D streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. There was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. Of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with V. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with K. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. The timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates to a Glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.
TI  - Aetiology of chronic prostatitis.
AB  - A total of 388 patients with symptoms of chronic prostatitis and inflammatory findings in expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) or in a urine sample collected immediately after prostate massage, were examined over a 2 year period at the Outpatient Department for Urogenital Infections, University Hospital for Infectious Diseases 'Dr Fran Mihaljevic', Zagreb, Croatia. The infective aetiology was determined in 276 (71.13%) patients. Chlamydia trachomatis was the causative pathogen in 109 patients, Trichomonas vaginalis in 52, Escherichia coli in 26, enterococci in 25, Proteus mirabilis in 14, Klebsiella pneumoniae in six, Streptococcus agalactiae in eight, Ureaplasma urealyticum in seven patients with chronic prostatitis. Other patients had a mixed infection.
TI  - Identification and incidence of fungal strains in chronic rhinosinusitis patients.
AB  - The fungal revolution taking place in otorhinology inspired us to study the frequency of occurrence of fungi in the nasal mucus of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients (with or without polyposis) in order to evaluate the incidence of eosinophilic fungal sinusitis in CRS patients. Ninety-six samples were examined from patients with CRS. In 74 cases mucus was collected non-invasively, and in 22 cases during operation. The Gram-stained direct smears of all samples were also evaluated. Bacteria and fungi colonizing in the mucus were detected by culturing method. The control group consisted of 50 healthy volunteers. Typical aerobic pathogenic bacteria could be isolated from 34 patients. Fifty-seven aerobic bacteria were isolated, i.e. 1.6 bacteria/positive patient with a maximum of 3 different bacteria/sample. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. Yeasts and moulds could be detected from 79 patients (83%): Candida albicans, Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp, and Penicillium spp. were isolated most frequently. Altogether 237 yeasts and moulds were isolated, i.e. 3.0 different fungi/positive patient, with a maximum of 5 different fungi/sample. In the control group aerobic pathogens were not isolated, only apathogenic species. Fungi were isolated from 22 healthy patients (44%). These data indicate that fungi are frequently involved in the aetiology of CRS. IgE-medicated hypersensitivity to fungal allergens could not be proven in our patients.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind study of prulifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in patients  with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently the role of bacteria in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB) as well as antibiotic treatment with selected drugs, especially fluoroquinolones, have been better defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety in patients with AECB of prulifloxacin in comparison with ciprofloxacin. METHODS: AECB was defined according to the guidelines for the evaluation of new anti-infective drugs for the treatment of respiratory tract infections (1992). 235 patients took part in the trial; 117 (88 males and 29 females, mean age 64.8 years) received 600 mg prulifloxacin once daily and 118 (91 males and 27 females, mean age 64.5 years) 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day, for a duration of 10 days. The study design was randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy. Efficacy evaluations were performed by comparing pretreatment and posttreatment assessments. The clinical response was determined by 4-point rating scores on cough, dyspnea, and expectoration (volume and appearance). The microbiological response was assessed on sputum specimen. RESULTS: Clinical success was observed in 84.7 and 85% of patients in the prulifloxacin and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. The 95% confidence interval proved the equivalence of treatments. Both drugs successfully eradicated the most commonly isolated strains, including Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse drug reactions were always of mild or moderate intensity. CONCLUSION: The study showed that a 10-day course of prulifloxacin is as effective and safe as ciprofloxacin in the treatment of patients with AECB.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

The others were due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Group B streptococcus. The remaining 19 patients had cerebrospinal fluid findings consistent with bacterial meningitis. CONCLUSION: Meningitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, constitutes a large percentage of childhood meningitis in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This increase is highly attributed to the lack of vaccination against this organism. We recommend introducing this vaccine as a part of the routine vaccination schedule for all children.

TI  - In vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial effect of commercially available mastitis medications combined with EDTA-Tris on bacteria that cause mastitis in cattle.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of selected commercial mastitis medications with and without EDTA-Tris by comparing minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum bactericidal concentrations in vitro. Solutions containing 5 mM EDTA/50 mM Tris potentiated the antimicrobial action of seven commercially available mastitis medications when reacted in vitro with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Lesser potentiation was observed for Escherichia coli, whereas no potentiation was observed for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The incorporation of EDTA-Tris solutions into mastitis medications may reduce the amount of antibiotics necessary for therapy and may prevent formation of antibiotic-resistant forms.
TI  - Trends in antibacterial susceptibility of mastitis pathogens during a seven-year  period.
AB  - Milk samples collected from dairy cattle suspected of having mastitis were submitted to the Microbiology Laboratory of the Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Michigan State University, for bacteriologic culture. A total of 2778 isolates, from the years 1994 to 2000, were isolated, identified, and subjected to in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the disk diffusion method, in accordance with National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) standards. Isolates included in this study were Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcesens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The proportion of bacterial isolates determined to be susceptible did not change during the 7-yr period for the majority of bacterial-antibacterial interactions tested. However, analysis for linear trend in proportions determined that there were increases in the proportion of S. aureus isolates that were susceptible to ampicillin, penicillin, and erythromycin. For Strep. uberis, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred for oxacillin, sulfa-trimethoprim, gentamicin, and pirlimycin, and a decrease in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with penicillin. For Strep. dysgalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with erythromycin, gentamicin, sulfa-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. For Strep. agalactiae, increases in the proportion of susceptible isolates occurred with sulfa-trimethoprim. Among E. coli isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ampicillin and cephalothin. Among K pneumoniae isolates, there was an increase in the proportion that were susceptible to ceftiofur. Overall, there was no indication of increased resistance of mastitis isolates to antibacterials that are commonly used in dairy cattle.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral beta-lactam antibiotics as a two-dimensional approach to their efficacy.
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are increasingly recognized as important determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of an antibiotic. For beta-lactam antibiotics, the most important determinant of the antimicrobial efficacy, and hence predictor of therapeutic efficacy, is the length of time that serum concentrations exceed the MIC. Dosing schedules for beta-lactam antibiotics should maintain serum concentrations above the MIC for the bacterial pathogen for at least 50% of the dosing interval to achieve therapeutic efficacy and prevent the development of resistance. This is a basic criterion for the clinical efficacy of beta-lactams. A combination of microbiological activity and pharmacokinetic characteristics was applied to calculate the time that serum antibiotic concentrations exceed the MIC for the major respiratory tract pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In contrast with some other oral beta-lactam antibiotics, cefpodoxime 200 mg bd maintains serum concentrations above the MIC for each organism for at least 50% of the dosing interval and may therefore be an attractive choice for empirical therapy of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against community-acquired respiratory pathogens from three European countries.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is universally recognized as a major problem. A European resistance survey was established to monitor the activity of widely used oral antibiotics against common respiratory tract pathogens. Studies were conducted in Italy, Spain and Austria to monitor resistance patterns among respiratory Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae to amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav, penicillin, cefaclor, cefadroxil, cefalexin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefixime, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, clarithromycin and azithromycin (the antibiotics tested varying slightly from country to country). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using the NCCLS-recommended broth microdilution method. Among the antibiotics tested, cefpodoxime, an oral cephalosporin, was remarkably active against the major respiratory pathogens in all three countries. Cefpodoxime was more potent than cefaclor, cefixime and ceftibuten against pneumococci, especially against strains with decreased sensitivity to penicillin, and more active than cefaclor and cefuroxime against Gram-negative respiratory pathogens. Pneumococci and staphylococci displayed a very high level of in vitro macrolide resistance. These data indicate that cefpodoxime represents an appropriate choice in the treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infection in the three countries surveyed.
TI  - Potency and antimicrobial spectrum update for piperacillin/tazobactam (2000): emphasis on its activity against resistant organism populations and generally untested species causing community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam and several comparison broad-spectrum compounds was assessed against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria from geographically diverse medical centers in Europe, North and Latin America participating in various surveillance programs in 2000. Several organisms were characterized for phenotypic expression of various resistant determinants such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or amp C cephalosporinase hyperproduction, and vancomycin resistance in enterococci (VRE). Piperacillin/tazobactam retained activity (MIC50) against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. (0.12-0.5 microg/ml), Bacillus spp. (0.5 microg/ml), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (>4 microg/ml), and Corynebacterium spp. (2 microg/ml; not including C. jeikeium) with susceptibility rates of 100.0, 91.7, 85.7 and 81.8%, respectively. Piperacillin/tazobactam inhibited all Streptococcus spp. strains at < or = 16 microg/ml, including penicillin-resistant strains many of which were co-resistant to erythromycin (90%) and other beta-lactams. A specific breakpoint for these streptococci when testing piperacillin/tazobactam appears needed to prevent false-resistant reports using penicillin as a class representative. The carbapenems among beta-lactams were the most active agents against the ESBL-producing species of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and those strains which hyper-express amp C enzymes including Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Piperacillin/tazobactam only exhibited modest activity against the "amp C resistance group" strains (68.8% susceptible or intermediate, MIC < or = 64 microg/ml). Piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC50, 8 microg/ml; 79.5% susceptible) was the most active agent tested against multi-drug resistant isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against sampled Haemophilus influenzae (39.2% ampicillin-resistant), piperacillin/tazobactam (MIC(90,) < or = 0.06 microg/ml), ceftriaxone and ceftazidime inhibited 100.0% of the isolates at < or = 0.25 microg/ml. These in vitro surveillance results from the year 2000 on three continents, demonstrated a sustained potent activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against selected problematic nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. The potential importance of these findings is that this beta-lactamase inhibitor combination can be used an empiric treatment of serious infections in hospital environments where resistance has emerged, as well as covering nearly all isolates of fastidious respiratory tract pathogens acquired in the community setting.
TI  - Pharmacodynamics of the new fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin in murine thigh and lung infection models.
AB  - Gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against gram-positive cocci. We used the neutropenic murine thigh infection model to characterize the time course of antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin and determine which pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter best correlated with efficacy. The thighs of mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) CFU of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli, and the mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg of body weight per day, with the dose fractionated for dosing every 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Levels in serum were measured by microbiologic assay. In vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) were calculated from serial values of the log(10) numbers of CFU per thigh 2 to 4 h after the administration of doses of 8 and 32 mg/kg. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which PK-PD parameter best correlated with the numbers of CFU per thigh at 24 h. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed peak/dose values of 0.23 to 0.32, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)/dose values of 0.47 to 0.62, and half-lives of 0.6 to 1.1 h. Gatifloxacin produced in vivo PAEs of 0.2 to 3.1 h for S. pneumoniae and 0.4 to 2.3 h for S. aureus. The 24-h AUC/MIC was the PK-PD parameter that best correlated with efficacy (R(2) = 90 to 94% for the three organisms, whereas R(2) = 70 to 81% for peak level/MIC and R(2) = 48 to 73% for the time that the concentration in serum was greater than the MIC). There was some reduced activity when dosing every 24 h was used due to the short half-life of gatifloxacin in mice. In subsequent studies we used the neutropenic and nonneutropenic murine thigh and lung infection models to determine if the magnitude of the AUC/MIC needed for the efficacy of gatifloxacin varied among pathogens (including resistant strains) and infection sites. The mice were infected with 10(6.5) to 10(7.4) CFU of four isolates of S. aureus (one methicillin resistant) per thigh, nine isolates of S. pneumoniae (two penicillin intermediate, four penicillin resistant, and two ciprofloxacin resistant) per thigh, four isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae per thigh, a single isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per thigh, and 10(8.3) CFU of Klebsiella pneumoniae per lung. The mice were then treated for 24 h with 0.29 to 600 mg of gatifloxacin per kg every 6 or 12 h. A sigmoid dose-response model was used to estimate the dose (in milligrams per kilogram per 24 h) required to achieve a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h. MICs ranged from 0.015 to 8 microg/ml. The 24-h AUC/MICs for each static dose (1.7 to 592) varied from 16 to 72. Mean +/- standard deviation 24-h AUC/MICs for isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, S. pneumoniae, and S. aureus were 41 +/- 21, 52 +/- 20, and 36 +/- 9, respectively. Methicillin, penicillin, or ciprofloxacin resistance did not alter the magnitude of the AUC/MIC required for efficacy. The 24-h AUC/MICs required to achieve bacteriostatic effects against K. pneumoniae were quite similar in the thigh and lung (70 versus 56 in neutropenic mice and 32 versus 43 in nonneutropenic mice, respectively). The magnitude of the 24-h AUC/MIC of gatifloxacin required for efficacy against multiple pathogens varied only fourfold and was not significantly altered by drug resistance or site of infection.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharides conjugated to the outer membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae elicit protective antibodies.
AB  - Polysaccharides (PSs) derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae include more than 90  serotypes and differ greatly in their immunogenicity. In addition, immunization with PSs does not induce high affinity antibody production and no memory B-cells are generated. Coupling PSs to carrier proteins has been reported to induce B-cell maturation and to install a B-cell memory. As an alternative carrier protein, the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae has been coupled to various PSs. We evaluated the immunogenicity of two PS conjugates, using PS derived from S. pneumoniae types 14 and 19. In this report, we show that anti-PS IgG responses are generated after the conjugation of PSs to P40. In addition, the humoral response generated is able to protect mice from a bacterial challenge. Our results indicate that P40 could be included in the development of new PS conjugate vaccines.
TI  - Ceftriaxone activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens isolated in US clinical microbiology laboratories from 1996 to 2000: results from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA.
AB  - Ceftriaxone was introduced into clinical practice in the USA in 1985 and was the  first extended-spectrum (third-generation) cephalosporin approved for once-daily treatment of patients with Gram-positive or Gram-negative infections. Review of ceftriaxone activity is important given its continued use since the mid-1980s and reports of emerging resistance among all antimicrobial agent classes. We reviewed the activity of ceftriaxone and relevant comparative agents against five Gram-positive and 11 Gram-negative species for a 5-year period, 1996-2000, using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA. All MIC results were interpreted using NCCLS breakpoint criteria. Ceftriaxone resistance among isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=17219) remained essentially unchanged over the 5 years studied and in fact was lower from 1998 to 2000 (5.0-5.1%) than in 1996 (6.3%) and 1997 (6.6%). Ceftriaxone resistance (range, 5.1-6.9%) among viridans group streptococci (n=6621) varied by <2% from 1997 to 2000. Beta-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes (n=935) and group B beta-haemolytic streptococci (n=2267) were not identified in any year. Among methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n=39 284) ceftriaxone resistance was 0.1-0.3% per year from 1996 to 2000. Ceftriaxone resistance among Escherichia coli (n=472407; range, 0.2-0.4%), Klebsiella oxytoca (n=16231; range, 3.5-4.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=117754; range, 1.9-2.6%), Proteus mirabilis (n=67692; range, 0.2-0.3%), Morganella morganii (n=11251; range, 0.3-2.1%) and Serratia marcescens (n=26519; range, 1.6-3.8%) was low and consistent from 1996 to 2000. Resistance to ceftriaxone among Enterobacter cloacae (n=48114; range, 21.7-23.9%) was relatively high, compared with other Enterobacteriaceae, but unchanged from 1996 to 2000. Rates of resistance to ceftriaxone among Acinetobacter spp. (n=20813) increased from 24.8% in 1996 to 45.1% in 2000. All Haemophilus influenzae (n=7911) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n=218) were susceptible to ceftriaxone, as were 99.7% of Moraxella catarrhalis (n=312) tested in 1996 and 1997. In summary, ceftriaxone has retained its potent activity against the most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative human pathogens despite widespread and ongoing clinical use for more than 15 years.
TI  - BMS284756 (formerly T-3811, a des-fluoroquinolone) potency and spectrum tested against over 10,000 bacterial bloodstream infection isolates from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme (2000).
AB  - BMS284756 is a novel des-F (6)-quinolone, which has a wide range of activity against many species of Gram-positive and -negative organisms. The potency of BMS284756 was compared with that of other quinolones, including ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and levofloxacin, and was tested against >10,000 bloodstream isolates from the year 2000 SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance programme. Twelve pathogens accounted for nearly all of the referred isolates and included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-haemolytic or viridans group streptococci. Of the four quinolones tested, BMS284756 was the most active overall against Staphylococcus spp. (MIC(50) < or = 0.03 mg/L) and Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50) 0.06 mg/L). In contrast, BMS284756 was less potent than the other quinolones against the enteric Gram-negative bacilli (MIC(50) < or = 0.03-1 mg/L). With a proposed breakpoint of < or =4 mg/L, BMS284756 may be a therapeutic alternative pending the results of clinical trials.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
AB  - Aspirates of 15 acutely and 13 chronically infected frontal sinuses were processed for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 20 isolates (1.3 per specimen) were recovered from the 15 cases of acute frontal sinusitis, 16 aerobic and facultative isolates (1.1 per specimen) and 4 anaerobic isolates (0.3 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms alone were recovered in 13 specimens (87%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 2 (13%). The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), and Moraxella catarrhalis (3). A total of 32 isolates were recovered from the 13 cases (2.5 per patient) of chronic frontal sinusitis, 12 aerobic and facultative isolates (0.9 per specimen) and 20 anaerobic isolates (1.5 per specimen). Aerobic and facultative organisms only were recovered in 3 instances (23%), anaerobes only in 7 instances (54%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 3 instances (23%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were gram-negative bacilli (H influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The predominant anaerobes included Prevotella species (8), Peptostreptococcus species (6), and Fusobacterium species (4). These findings illustrate the microbiologic features of acute and chronic frontal sinusitis.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of IV catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 100 dogs. PROCEDURE: Catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. The distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. The saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. All bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. Most bacteria that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (Serratia odorifera, S. liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Acinobacter anitratus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp). Only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus spp). High percentages of organisms were resistant to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. Percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that IV catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.
TI  - Jaundice as an early diagnostic sign of urinary tract infection in infancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common clinical problem in febrile infants younger than 8 weeks old, with a prevalence between 5% and 11%. Previous studies have noted that jaundice may be one of the first signs of a bacterial infection in infants. Our goal was to determine the incidence of UTIs in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old and to determine which historical and laboratory parameters are associated with UTIs. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated asymptomatic, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old for evidence of a UTI (defined as >10 000 colony-forming units per milliliter of a single pathogen, obtained by bladder catheterization). A serum fractionated bilirubin level was obtained on all study patients. Detailed questionnaires were completed, which included demographic information, prenatal, intrapartum, and postnatal events. RESULTS: Twelve (7.5%) of 160 infants had a UTI (95% confidence interval: 3.9%-12.7%). Isolated organisms included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Streptococcus viridans, and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age had a higher incidence of UTI, 6 (50%) of 12 infants in the positive culture group, versus 15 (10%) of 148 infants in the negative culture group. Abnormal urinalysis and microscopy results were noted in 5 (42%) of 12 infants with a UTI, and 6 (55%) of 11 infants had abnormal renal ultrasound results. CONCLUSION: A UTI was found in 7.5% of asymptomatic, afebrile, jaundiced infants younger than 8 weeks old. In addition, infants with the onset of jaundice after 8 days of age or patients with an elevated conjugated bilirubin fraction were more likely to have a UTI. Therefore, we recommend that testing for a UTI be included as part of the evaluation in asymptomatic, jaundiced infants presenting to the emergency department.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [The study of the frequency and features of bacteria isolated in patients with non-tuberculosis respiratory disorders admitted in "M. Nasta" Institute in the first trimester 2001].
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the spectrum of bacteria isolated in patients with non-TB respiratory disorders, in order to find the frequency of germs isolated globally and in each of the 6 clinical syndromes: suppurations, chronic obstructive diseases exacerbations (COPD, bronchial asthma), pneumopathies, post-TB syndromes, tumors and interstitial lung diseases. We found the greatest global frequency in anaerobes (35%). This is in concordance with the high frequency of broncho-pulmonary suppurations (51% of the cases studied). In second place comes Ps. aeruginosa (18%), followed by Str. Pneumoniae (16%), H. influenzae (11%) and Klebsiella pn. (10%). Considering the germs identified in the various clinical syndromes, we found a high frequency of anaerobes associated to suppurations (51%), interstitial lung diseases (43%) and tumors (37%), while Ps. aeruginosa is first in post-TB syndromes (50%) and COPD exacerbations (21%), equal to H. influenzae. In pneumonias, Str. Pneumoniae was most frequently isolated (38%) followed by H. influenzae (25%). The susceptibility testing of strains of Klebsiella and Ps. aeruginosa revealed the increasing tendency to resistance to broad spectrum antibiotics, especially for Ps. aeruginosa, with consecutive difficulties in finding the appropriate treatment.
TI  - NB2001, a novel antibacterial agent with broad-spectrum activity and enhanced potency against beta-lactamase-producing strains.
AB  - Enzyme-catalyzed therapeutic activation (ECTA) is a novel prodrug strategy to overcome drug resistance resulting from enzyme overexpression. beta-Lactamase overexpression is a common mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. We present here the results for one of the beta-lactamase ECTA compounds, NB2001, which consists of the antibacterial agent triclosan in a prodrug form with a cephalosporin scaffold. Unlike conventional beta-lactam antibiotics, where hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring inactivates the antibiotic, hydrolysis of NB2001 by beta-lactamase releases triclosan. Evidence supporting the proposed mechanism is as follows. (i) NB2001 is a substrate for TEM-1 beta-lactamase, forming triclosan with a second-order rate constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of greater than 77,000 M-1 s-1. (ii) Triclosan is detected in NB2001-treated, beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli but not in E. coli that does not express beta-lactamase. (iii) NB2001 activity against beta-lactamase-producing E. coli is decreased in the presence of the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. NB2001 was similar to or more potent than reference antibiotics against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. NB2001 is also active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. The results indicate that NB2001 is a potent, broad-spectrum antibacterial agent and demonstrate the potential of ECTA in overcoming beta-lactamase-mediated resistance.
TI  - Pathogenic isolates in meningitis patients in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine, from laboratory records, the spectrum of bacterial and  fungal pathogens isolated from cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of in-patients with meningitis at Muhimbili Medical Centre (MMC) in Dar es Salaam and to ascertain the laboratory results (based on microscopy and culture) using the latex agglutination technique. DESIGN: A retrospective study based on laboratory records of CSF samples investigated between November 1999 and June 2000 and a cross-sectional study involving investigation of 60 freshly collected CSF samples by conventional (microscopy and culture) and antigen detection by latex agglutination technique (LAT). SETTING: Muhimbili Medical Centre in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. INVESTIGATIONS: Information from laboratory records, bacteriological examination of CSF by microscopy, culture and agglutination techniques. RESULTS: According to records, a total of 1144 CSF samples were investigated between November 1999 and June 2000, of which two hundred and twenty two specimens (19.4%) had a positive bacterial or fungal culture. Fifty five of the isolates were from children (aged less than 15 years) and were; 20 (36.4%) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 12(21.8%) were Cryptococcus neoformans, and nine (16.4%) were Haemophilus influenzae type b. The remaining 14 (25%) isolates included three group B streptococci, three Klebsiella spp, two E. coli, two Staphylococcus aureus, two Pseudomonas spp, one Moraxella and one Salmonella group B. For adults a total of 167 positive cultures were reported and 163 (97.6%) of the isolates were Cryptococcus neoformans, two (1.2%) were Pseudomonas spp. and two were S. aureus. There was good agreement between conventional microscopy and culture with the latex agglutination technique in the identification of CSF pathogens. CONCLUSION: In children, S. pneumonia, and bacteria in general constituted the majority of isolates. Adult cases of meningitis were almost exclusively due to C. neoformans. Overall, C. neoformans appears to be the most common isolate among meningitis cases. Based on LAT results, our routine diagnostic methods seem to be adequate in the identification of the common CSF pathogens.
TI  - A decade of antimicrobial susceptibilities at the University of Kentucky Hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility rates for key antimicrobial agents and selective bacterial pathogens in the decade of the 1990s. METHODS: Data from 1990 to 2000 from the University of Kentucky Clinical Microbiology Laboratory were analyzed by linear regression analysis to identify agents and pathogens that show a decline in susceptibility. For selected pathogens and antimicrobial agents, predictions were made for further declines in susceptibility for 2005 and 2010. RESULTS: Significant declines in susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents were found for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Further declines were predicted for 2005 and 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Examination of susceptibility rates over time in a university hospital medical center provides useful data for future planning. In our institution, antimicrobial susceptibility rates have significantly declined during the 1990s for certain antimicrobial agents and bacterial pathogens. We are attempting to change our antimicrobial use patterns through formulary manipulation and clinician education, which may retard or prevent such declines in the future.
TI  - Susceptibility of bacterial isolates to cefepime in comparison to other broad spectrum antimicrobial agents at a tertiary care center in Lebanon.
AB  - Newly introduced antimicrobial agents have to be evaluated to establish their current activity and susceptibility data base against microorganisms for future comparison. Cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin that was recently introduced in Lebanon but no background susceptibility data is available for it in this country. We prospectively analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of the bacterial isolates from the American University of Beirut Medical Center to a number of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents and compared it to the susceptibility of cefepime. Consecutive clinical bacterial isolates, representing 665 gram-negative and 387 gram-positive were tested: 82 to 100% of the gram-negative isolates were susceptible to cefepime, including most of the extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae. All the oxacillin susceptible staphylococcus isolates, and the penicillin susceptible Streptococcus spp. as well as 92% of the S. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible. The data shows that currently, cefepime provides a very broad spectrum of activity against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacterial isolates recovered from clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro action of carboxyfullerene.
AB  - Fullerene compounds have avid reactivity with free radicals and are regarded as 'radical sponges'. The trimalonic acid derivative of fullerene is one of the water-soluble compounds that has been synthesized and found to be an effective antioxidant both in vivo and in vitro. Carboxyfullerene has been shown to be effective in the treatment of both Gram-positive and -negative infections, although its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentration of carboxyfullerene for 20 isolates, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. We further investigated the action of carboxyfullerene using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), anticarboxyfullerene antibody binding assay and a membrane perturbation assay. All Gram-positive species were inhibited by < or = 50 mg/L of carboxyfullerene, whereas Gram-negative species were not inhibited, even at 500 mg/L carboxyfullerene. Bactericidal activity was demonstrated only for Gram-positive species, particularly for Streptococcus pyogenes A-20, which was killed rapidly. Intercalation of carboxyfullerene into the cell wall of staphylococci and streptococci was demonstrated by TEM and anti-carboxyfullerene binding assay. Damage to the cell membrane in Gram-positive, but not Gram-negative, bacteria was confirmed by the membrane perturbation assay. These findings indicate that the action of carboxyfullerene on Gram-positive bacteria is achieved by insertion into the cell wall and destruction of membrane integrity.
TI  - Use of computerized image analysis to quantify staphylococcal adhesion to canine  corneocytes: does breed and body site have any relevance to the pathogenesis of pyoderma?
AB  - An optimized system of computerized image analysis was used to investigate variations in the adherence of Staphylococcus intermedius to canine corneocytes from four different breed groups and six different anatomical sites. S. intermedius showed significantly greater adherence to the head and neck compared with the dorsum, but adherence to the limb, axilla and groin did not differ from other sites. Furthermore, there was significantly greater adherence of S. intermedius to corneocytes from the dorsum, forelimb, axilla and groin of Boxers and Bull Terriers than Spaniels and Hounds. S. intermedius, and also Pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibited abundant adherence, which was significantly greater than Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus canis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. In addition, S. intermedius adherence demonstrated a sigmoid dose-response curve with increasing bacterial concentration. These results suggest that S. intermedius adheres to canine corneocytes by a specific receptor-ligand interaction and adheres to the skin of some breeds more avidly than others. However, variations in adherence between body regions would not account for the predilection sites of canine bacterial pyoderma.
TI  - Clinical, laboratory findings and microbiologic characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to characterize the clinical features, underlying disease states, laboratory findings and microbiological characterization of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. METHODOLOGY: For a 2-year period all consecutive patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis at Phramongkutklao Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, were recruited. Data including history, physical examination, underlying disease and laboratory studies were carefully reviewed and recorded. RESULTS: Fifty patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis were enrolled. Their mean age was 58 years. The most common background aetiology was tuberculosis. Six per cent of the patients were diagnosed as having diffuse panbronchiolitis. Normal chest radiographs were found in 10%. The common organisms isolated were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (6%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria which included Mycobacterium kansasii and Mycobacterium chelonae were found in 6%. CONCLUSION: We report the characteristics of bronchiectasis in Thai patients. The most common identifiable aetiology was tuberculosis.
TI  - A year's review of bacterial pneumonia at the central hospital of Lucerne, Switzerland.
AB  - Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains an important cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in inhospital patients. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients hospitalised at our hospital with the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia according to ICD-10 within one year. Of 360 identified charts, 335 met the requirements and were reviewed regarding risk factors, diagnosis, treatment, and overall mortality. The typical patient hospitalised with pneumonia was elderly (mean 68 years), male (60%), and suffered from comorbidities or predisposing factors (96.4%). A total of 72.8% of pneumonias were localized in the inferior lobes, and 21.1% had bilateral infiltrates. Etiologic agents were searched for in 297/335 patients (87.5%) and were found positive in 33.4%: of 169 blood cultures 9.5% were positive, of 150 sputum cultures taken 46.6% were positive, of 17 serologies taken 58.8% were positive, and of 9 pleural effusions analysed 22.2% were positive. Encapsulated bacteria were the most common found bacterial etiologies, namely Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) in 30.9% of patients with known bacterial etiology, Haemophilus in 24.7%, and Klebsiella in 12.4%. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not found. The three most commonly used antibiotics were amoxicillin/clavulanic acid used in 77.3% of patients, clarithromycin (41.2%), and ceftriaxone (16.6%). Mean duration of treatment was 12.1 days. 245/335 (73.1%) patients had a favourable outcome, 16.7% (56/335) of patients had a protracted illness with delayed resolution (i.e. prolonged hospital stay, need for intensive care, intubation or several of these complications). Overall mortality in our unit was 8.6%.
TI  - Production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 in whole blood stimulated by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced by live Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in whole blood in vitro. METHODS: In all, 49 different isolates were studied. Each of the 49 different isolates was incubated for 4 h with whole blood at a ratio of one monocyte per 1--5 bacteria. Plasma was then separated and frozen, and the concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured by enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: There was a positive correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 values, r=0.9. Gram-negative bacteria induced higher levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 than Gram-positive bacteria. Group G streptococci (GGS) induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and group A streptococci (GAS). Klebsiella pneumoniae induced higher levels of TNF-alpha than Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and Neisseria meningitidis. GGS induced higher levels of IL-6 than Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and GAS. When the relative amounts of cytokine induced by the strains were compared to serum concentrations measured on admission in patients with bacteremia caused by the same bacterial isolates there was no significant correlation. CONCLUSION: Species- and strain-related differences in cytokine-inducing properties were found which may have significance in clinical infections.
TI  - [Causative agents of bloodstream infections in children with neoplasm, in 5 hospitals of Santiago (1994-1998)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients in treatment for cancer can have fatal bacterial infections. Thus, in the presence of fever or other signs infection, antimicrobials have to be prescribed empirically. AIM: To know the causative agents of bacteremia in children with cancer, their changes with time and between different hospitals and their patterns of susceptibility. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed the blood cultores of children with cancer in five hospitals of Santiago, from 1994 at 1998. RESULTS: During the study period, 707 agents were isolated. The most frequently isolated species or genus were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (43%), Staphylococcus aureus (16%), Escherichia coli (9%), Klebsiella spp. (8%), Pseudomonas spp. (5%) and Candida spp. (4%). Coagulase negative Staphylococcus was 55% resistant to meticilin and S. aureus was 44% resistant. Enterobacteriaceae had 15% resistance to gentamicin and amikacin, 2% to imipenem, 26% to ceftriaxone, 21% to cefotaxime and 20% to ceftazidime. Among non fermenting agents resistance was 6% for imipenem, 9% for amikacin 10% for ciprofloxacin, 19% for ceftazidime and 22% for cefoperazone. The resistance of Streptococcus spp. (non pneumoniae) to penicillin reached 50% and that of Enterococcus spp. was of 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment for pediatric patients with cancer must be modified and new guidelines including more active medications for patients at risk for bacteremia, should be devised.
TI  - Bacteremia in children: etiologic agents, focal sites, and risk factors.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out on 210 cases of children under 10 years of age with fever. Cases of gastroenteritis, respiratory tract infections, and suspected sepsis in children seen or admitted to the pediatric hospital were studied. Clinical and microbiological data were recorded in a questionnaire or obtained from patient medical records. Most of the children with septicemia (71.3 per cent) were less than 1 year old. Focal source of bacteremia was gastroenteritis (40.4 per cent), pneumonia or bronchopneumonia (20 per cent), meningitis (7.4 per cent), and urinary tract infections (7.4 per cent). The predominant pathogens isolated from blood or stool specimens were gram-positive bacteria (53.3 per cent), mainly Streptococcus pneumoniae and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. The gram-negative bacteria (45.6 per cent) were mainly Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Yersinia spp. One case of Candida albicans (1.1 per cent) was reported. Pasteurella pneumotropica was reported in two cases for the first time. The mortality rate was 4 per cent, mostly from septicemia cases. Long duration of hospitalization (> 10 days) and parenteral feeding were identified as risk factors. Resistance of the isolated pathogens to several commonly used antibiotics was observed. Empirical treatment with antibiotics is recommended only in life-threatening cases.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and penetration rate into sputum of gatifloxacin, a novel 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone, and its therapeutic efficacy in respiratory infections.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against clinical isolates of  pathogenic bacteria was evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of gatifloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and rifampicin against 20 strains each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 15 strains each of Streptococcus Pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis, 12 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 18 strains of Mycobacterium intracellulare, and 22 strains each of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were determined. The minimum inhibitory concentrations90's of gatifloxacin against the above species were 0.12, 8, <==0.06, 0.5, 2, 2, <==0.06, 0.39, 0.05, 0.013, 2, 0.5, and 4 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Gatifloxacin was four times as active as ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and as active as ofloxacin against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gatifloxacin was as active as tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae. The antimycobacterial activity of gatifloxacin was similar to that of sparfloxacin. Five patients with chronic respiratory infections and one patient with acute pneumonia received 100-400 mg/day of gatifloxacin orally for 5-12 days (mean, 8.17 days). The clinical effects were excellent in one patient and good in five. One strain of Haemophilus influenzae was eradicated and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa persisted after therapy. Adverse reactions were mild and improved after completion of therapy. In one patient with chronic bronchitis, the maximum sputum concentrations 2-4 h after oral administration of 150 mg of gatifloxacin on days 1 and 6 were 0.88 and 1.45 &mgr;g/ml, respectively, and in serum the values were 0.84 and 1.24 &mgr;g/ml, respectively. Thus it was found that gatifloxacin possesses potent activity against respiratory pathogens (including Mycobacteriaceae), and shows good penetration rate into sputum, and that it can be used as the drug of first choice in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Research concerning the radioprotective and immunostimulating effects of deuterium-depleted water.
AB  - Mice fed for 15 days with Deuterium-Depleted Water (30 ppm deuterium) had a statistically significant increased survival rate compared with control groups fed with normal distilled water (150 ppm deuterium), after 8.5 Gy irradiation (61% survival in the test group versus 25% in the control group). The hematological picture showed that normal WBC, RBC and platelet counts were maintained in the test groups. Immunological parameters (serum opsonic and bactericidal capacity, bactericidal capacity of the peritoneal macrophages) showed a marked increase in the test groups compared to a severe decrease in the control groups. Auxiliary tests using chemical radiomimetics (hydrochloric embihine) and immunosuppressors (cyclophosphamide) showed a strong protective effect of deuterium-depleted water against the decrease of the leukocyte counts and other immunologic parameters. In conditions of experimental inflammation induced with subcutaneous-implanted pellets, deuterium-depleted water feeding resulted in a statistically significant increase of the inflammatory response, demonstrated by increased percentages of PMN and lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the increased phagocytic capacity of the peripheral blood PMN. Experimental infections induced with K. pneumoniae 506 and S. pneumoniae 558 in mice irradiated or treated with cyclophosphamide showed increased, non-specific immunity parameters. All results show a marked intensification of the immune defenses and increased proliferation of the peripheral blood cells, probably accounting for the radioprotective effects.
TI  - [The study on COPD rat model produced by bacterial infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the role of bacterial infection in pathogenesis of COPD. METHODS: The COPD animal model was developed by intranasal repeated injecting Klebsiella pneumoniae(K) or pneumococcal pneumoniae(P) into rat respiratory tract. Histomorphyological changes were observed, PaO2, PaCO2 and right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) were analysed. RESULTS: 1 week after injecting K and 4 week after injecting P, the epithelia of bronchioles showed obvious injury. From the 4th week there was severe chronic inflammatory process of bronchioles in 2 experimental groups including thickened wall, narrowed lumen and developed emphysema. In addition, the walls of arterioles accompanying bronchioles were also thickened obviously. Right ventricular systolic pressure raised in 2 experimental groups (P < 0.01). From the 16th week, PaO2 dropped and PaCO2 raised in K group. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated injecting intranasally of the proper amount of klebsiella pneumoniae or pneumococcal pneumoniae into rats' lungs can induce rat small airway inflammation and emphysema. Combining with PaO2, PaCO2 and RVSP analysis, we suggest the model established shows main features of COPD.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1998 and March 1999].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from April 1998 to March 1999). The number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. A total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and Escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of Gram-positive aerobes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. On the whole, among Gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from postoperative infections. Among Gram-positive anaerobes, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. Among Gram-negative aerobes, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. Among Gram-negative anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. In primary infections, the percentage of Gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobes have gradually declined. In postoperative infections, the percentage of Gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. The percentage of MRSA among S. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. The susceptibilities of B. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. Among other bacteria in B. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. E. coli and K. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. We found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.
TI  - ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF THE LEAF EXTRACT OF Lagerstroemia parviflora Roxb.
AB  - The benzene extract of the leaves of Lagerstroemia paviflora Roxb was tested for  its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Gram Positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition Produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic Ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the mycotoxin citrinin obtained from the fungus penicillium citrinum.
AB  - The mycotoxin Citrinin was obtained from the fungus Penicillium citrinum. It was  tested for it's Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against some gram positive strains viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtillis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition produced by the fungal extract against the bacterial strains were assayed and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in Croatia.
AB  - We describe the activities of the Croatian Committee for Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance and report surveillance results for 1999. Twenty-two Croatian microbiology laboratories participated in the study. Resistance rates for the organisms isolated in different centers varied widely, but certain trends were apparent. Penicillin resistance in pneumococci (38%), methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (22%), the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21%), and imipenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11%) represent major resistance problems, especially in large hospitals. A comprehensive system of antimicrobial resistance surveillance, combined with training and external quality control programs, has identified high rates of resistance in key pathogens in some regions of Croatia. The program has heightened awareness of the problems of antimicrobial resistance and contributed to ongoing improvements in laboratory practice.
TI  - A study on community acquired pneumonia in adults requiring hospital admission in Penang.
AB  - A study was carried out to determine the pattern of microbiological organisms causing community acquired pneumonia in adult patients admitted to Penang Hospital between November 1999 and August 2000. Altogether, 98 patients (64 males, 34 females) with a mean age (+/- S.D.) of 55.9 (+/- 19.0) (range 15 to 87) years were included in the study. Causative organisms were identified in 42 patients (42.9%). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was the commonest pathogen being identified in 15.3% of cases, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (5.1%). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp accounted for 3 cases each (3.1%) and Haemophilus influenzae, non-haemolytic Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp and Pseudomonas spp for 1 case each (1.0%). Four patients (4.1%) had dual infections and no case of legionella pneumonia was found in this series.
TI  - Carriage of gram-negative bacilli in young Brazilian children with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative bacilli are not infrequently encountered as etiologic organisms of pneumonia in children in warm-climate countries. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nasopharyngeal carriage rate and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli colonizing children with community-acquired pneumonia in Fortaleza, Brazil. METHODS: A single nasopharyngeal specimen was collected from children 2 months to 5 years of age presenting at one of the three children's hospitals in Fortaleza and fulfilling the World Health Organization criteria for pneumonia. Randomly recruited healthy children from public daycare centers and immunization clinics served as controls. RESULTS: The study included 912 children, 482 (53%) with pneumonia and 430 (47%) controls. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli were seen in 79 (16%) of the 482 children with pneumonia and 51 (12%) of the 430 healthy controls. Nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli were seen in 85 (18%) of children with pneumonia and 54 (13%) of healthy controls. Neither gender, nutritional status, season, previous hospital admission nor antibiotic use was associated with carriage with gram-negative bacilli. However, pneumonia was associated with increased carriage, whereas concomitant colonization with Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae was associated with decreased carriage with gram-negative bacilli. Only 36% of all Escherichia species and 76% of all Klebsiella isolates were susceptible to cotrimoxazole; 90% of all Acinetobacter species were susceptible to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: Nasopharyngeal carriage with gram-negative bacilli, in particular with Acinetobacter species, is common and associated with a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia in children in Fortaleza, Brazil.
TI  - Low cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid 42 in patients with acute bacterial meningitis and normalization after treatment.
AB  - CSF-A beta 42 may be a marker of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A decreased level of CSF-A beta 42 is consistently found in AD and has been suggested to be related to the deposition of amyloid plaques in the brain. However, low CSF-A beta 42 levels have also been found in disorders devoid of plaques, for instance Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. To examine if the level of A beta 42 in CSF is related to inflammatory processes, we studied CSF-A beta 42 levels in eight patients with acute purulent bacterial meningitis, 10 patients with acute viral meningitis and 18 age-matched controls. In acute purulent bacterial meningitis, the CSF-A beta 42 level was markedly reduced (28% of that in controls, P<0.0001), whereas no change was found in viral meningitis. After successful treatment of bacterial meningitis, the CSF-A beta 42 level increased (P<0.05 compared to baseline) and did no longer differ from that in controls (ns). The decrease could not be explained by interference with high protein levels, since addition of increasing volumes of serum did not influence the CSF-A beta 42 levels. Our findings suggest that the reduction in CSF-A beta 42 found in bacterial meningitis is not a direct consequence of the inflammatory process. The cause may be disturbance of the clearance of A beta 42 from the brain.
TI  - [The sensitivity of common bacteria to antibiotics in children in southern Israel].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many reports describe an increasing antibiotic resistance among various pathogenic bacteria. Since every empiric antibiotic treatment is also based on the expected antibiogram of the probable isolate, it is essential to frequently monitor the resistance trends at different ages and contexts. AIM: The purpose of this study was to monitor the antibiogram of a large bacterial population isolated from pediatric bacteremia episodes. METHODS: All bacteremia episodes of children under the age of 18 years in the Soroka Medical Center, Beer Sheva, Israel, were prospectively documented from January 1990 to December 1998. RESULTS: Of the 5,373 positive blood cultures that were noted during the study period, 1,689 were considered as true different episodes. During the years 1990-92, 1993-95 and 1996-98 454, 538 and 697 episodes were noted, respectively. The most common pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (447 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (224 isolates), Escherichia coli (187 isolates) and Klebsiella spp (180 isolates). The antibiotic sensitivity of the pathogens declined with time in some of the cases and increased in others. The major problems raised were the development of ESBL (extended spectrum beta lactamase) and MRSA (methacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) producing isolates, high level of resistance of coagulase negative Staphylococci and Acinetobacter to most of the antibiotic agents, and increasing resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to various agents. CONCLUSION: Despite the significant increase in the antibiotic resistance of many of the pathogens tested, there are still various therapeutic options available.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of five quinolone antibiotics, including gemifloxacin, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, levofloxacin and gemifloxacin against 343 clinical isolates were compared. Gemifloxacin showed the greatest activity, with MIC90 values as low as 0.03-0.25 mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Enterobacter spp. strains exhibited low rates of susceptibility to all five fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.

AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - An observational study on the epidemiology of respiratory tract bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to four injectable beta-lactam antibiotics: piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone.
AB  - Bacterial infections of the respiratory tract account for a large proportion of total medical consultations in general practice. In recent years, antibiotic resistance has increased alarmingly in a number of bacterial species that are common causes of these infections. The aim of this observational study was to determine the antibiotic resistance of microbial agents isolated from patients with acute or acutely exacerbated respiratory infections. Subjects recruited as potential sources of bacteria were either outpatients seen in a number of specialized clinics and hospital practices, or hospitalized patients. Overall, 648 consecutive patients (67% male, mean age 48.1+/-27.0 years) with infection of the upper or lower respiratory tract were observed during a 13-month period. A total of 551 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated and tested for their in vitro susceptibility to piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone. Among all isolates, the four most frequent pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (132 isolates, 24%), Streptococcus pyogenes (99 isolates, 18%), Staphylococcus aureus (93 isolates, 17%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (46 isolates, 8%). The susceptibility of gram-positive isolates ranged from 97.5% to 95.1%, and no remarkable difference was found in the antibacterial activity of tested b-lactam antibiotics. The susceptibility of gram-negative isolates to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam was also similar: 96.5% and 97.1%, respectively. In contrast, differences were found between piperacillin (or piperacillin/tazobactam) and either ceftazidime (p=0.003) or ceftriaxone (p<0.0003) in gram-negative isolates. We conclude that, despite the extensive use of beta-lactam antibiotics (piperacillin, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone) in medical practice during the past three decades, the susceptibility of the most common pathogens involved in the etiology of upper and lower respiratory tract infections to these antibiotics is still high. In particular, bacterial resistance developed by gram-positive organisms against piperacillin is negligible and not alarming.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of ertapenem (MK-0826), a long-acting carbapenem, tested against selected resistant strains.
AB  - Ertapenem (MK-0826) is a novel, long-acting parenteral carbapenem. The purpose of this in vitro study was to test ertapenem's activity against a collection of multiply-resistant strains of gram-positive and -negative bacteria isolated from locations worldwide, and to examine its bactericidal activity and ability to act in a synergistic manner in combination with other antimicrobial agents. Ertapenem was active against a variety of gram-negative pathogens, with particular potency noted for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s < or =0.015-0.5 microg/mL) including extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. Less ertapenem activity was seen against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, especially ceftazidime-resistant strains (MIC50 16 microg/mL). Except for enterococci, ertapenem was active against most gram-positive species, including beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC90 0.03 microg/mL; 100% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC90 2 microg/mL; 98.1% susceptible), and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 < or =0.015 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Ertapenem was also very potent against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.25 microg/mL; 100% susceptible). Bactericidal action was observed versus staphylococci, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, and at least an additive effect was detected against the majority of the strains tested when ertapenem was combined with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin. These results from testing 902 organisms indicate that ertapenem appears to be a promising broad-spectrum carbapenem with a possible role against some emerging resistant species.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of GAR-936 tested against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive blood stream infection isolates and strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - GAR-936, a new, semisynthetic glycylcycline, has shown good antibacterial activity against a wide range of clinically important Gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, most Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. The purpose of this study was to determine the activity of GAR-936 against a range of Gram-positive and -negative bloodstream isolates including many strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Six hundred four bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci collected as part of the SENTRY surveillance program were selected for their geographic diversity. GAR-936 was also tested against an additional 176 Gram-negative cocci isolates (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 98 strains; Escherichia coli, 78 strains), 96 of which were ESBL-producers. Broth microdilution testing was used to determine the susceptibility of the selected organisms and a range of comparator antimicrobial agents whose choice was based on their activities against the selected pathogens and included a mix of both newer and older agents. Presence of an ESBL-producing strain was confirmed using the clavulanate test. GAR-936 demonstrated impressive activity against all 604 strains of Gram-positive cocci, with an MIC range of <or=0.015-1 microg/mL, and MIC(90)s ranging from <or=0.05 microg/mL for S. pneumoniae to 0.25 for S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. MICs against the 176 Gram-negative isolates were higher (range 0.06-4 microg/mL), with MIC(90)s of 0.25-1 microg/mL. The activity of GAR-936 was relatively unaffected by the presence of ESBLs. The activity of GAR-936 was particularly impressive against Gram-positive cocci when compared against the test results for vancomycin and the newer antimicrobial agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin. The MIC(90)s for GAR-936 were significantly lower than the comparator agents for all species tested with particularly impressive results against S. pneumoniae and enterococci.
TI  - [Severe community-acquired pneumonia: etiology].
AB  - A complex microbiological (sputum, protected brush biopsy of the bronchial mucosa) and immunological examination of 40 male patients (the average age of 55.4 +/- 8.8 years) with severe community-acquired pneumonia (risk classes III-V according to Fine M.J. et al., 1997) revealed the disease etiology in 52.5 per cent of the cases. The leading pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae. It was detected in 61.6 per cent of the cases of the etiologically verified pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also among the actual pathogens (14.3 and 14.3 per cent respectively). The Legionnaires infection was not confirmed in any of the patients (enzyme-linked immunological analysis of urine for the serotype 1-6 Legionella pneumophila antigen). In the absolute majority of the patients the isolated pneumococci were susceptible (E-test) to benzylpenicillin. Only in 1 patients with severe pneumonia and secondary bacteriemia the pneumococcal isolates were moderately resistant to benzylpenicillin (the MIC of 0.125 mg/ml). Still, they were susceptible to ceftriaxone (the MIC of 0.023 mg/ml). The data are useful in the development of a national (regional) programme for empirical antibacterial therapy of severe community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1999)].
AB  - From October 1999 to September 2000, we collected the specimen from 430 patients  with lower respiratory tract infections in 17 institutions in Japan, and investigated the susceptibilities of isolated bacteria to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and patients' characteristics. Of 515 strains that were isolated from specimen (mainly from sputum) and assumed to be bacteria causing in inflammation, 506 strains were investigated. The breakdown of the isolated bacteria were: Staphylococcus aureus 78, Streptococcus pneumoniae 101, Haemophilus influenzae 104, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid) 58, P. aeruginosa (mucoid) 11, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis 41, Klebsiella pneumoniae 18, etc. Of 78 S. aureus strains, those with 4 micrograms/ml or above of MIC of oxacillin (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) occupied 57.7%. Vancomycin and arbekacin showed the most potent activities against MRSA without detection of ABK-resistant strain (MIC: 64 micrograms/ml) and decrease of VCM-sensitive strains those were found in 1998. The frequency of S. pneumoniae exhibiting low sensitivity to penicillin (penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae: PISP + penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae: PRSP) decreased to 34.7% from 46.0% in 1998. The frequency of PRSP was 3.0%, being the least number after 1991. Carbapenems showed strong activities against S. pneumoniae. Especially, panipenem inhibited the growth of all 101 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. Generally, all drugs showed strong activities against H. influenzae with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. MICs of ofloxacin ranged between 0.063 microgram/ml and 4 micrograms/ml in 1998, however, those were 0.125 microgram/ml or below in all H. influenzae in 1999 showing the strongest activity. Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed strong activities against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. Number of isolated P. aeruginosa (mucoid) was little as 11, however, the susceptibilities to all drugs were better than P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). K. pneumoniae showed good susceptibilities to all drugs except for ampicillin with decreasing of low-sensitive strains compared to those detected in 1998. Also, all drugs generally showed strong activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis. MIC80s of all drugs were 2 micrograms/ml or below. The drug which showed the strongest activity was imipenem inhibiting all 41 strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. On the patients' characteristics, the number of patients aged 80 years or older who had been increased was decreased in 1999 in the distribution by age. The percentage of the elderly patients aged 70 years or older was 47.0%, which occupied almost a half number of the total patients as in the last year. As for the incidence by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the highest. They were noted in 37.9% and 30.5% of the patients, respectively. In 1999, bronchial asthma was frequently observed as compared in recent years. It was noted in about 10% of the patients which is the same % as in bronchiectasis. We examined the number of strains from these patients with infections before and after administration of antibiotics. In patients with bacterial pneumonia, the number of isolated strains was almost the same between those before and after administration. However, in patients with chronic bronchitis, the number of strains remarkably decreased to less than the half of the total after administration of antibiotics in the last year, but it decreased to 2/3 of the total in 1999. On the administration of antibiotics and isolated bacteria by the day of administration, the bacteria which were isolated more before administration were H. influenzae in 28.4%, S. pneumoniae in 25.7%, M. (B.) catarrhalis in 12.0% and S. aureus in 10.6%. The frequency of S. aureus after administration over 15 days was almost the same as that before administration, but the frequency of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was 36.8% which was higher than that before administration. The frequency of isolated S. pneumoniae was decreased after administration and none of them was isolated after completion of administration. However, that of H. influenzae was decreased to 7.1% after administration within 3 days, and many H. influenzae were isolated after completion of administration as 21.4%.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia in patients requiring hospitalization.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the microbial aetiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients requiring hospitalization. METHODOLOGY: A prospective study of consecutive non-immunocompromised patients aged 12 years and above admitted with CAP from August 1997 to May 1999 was undertaken. RESULTS: Of 127 patients hospitalized for CAP, an aetiological diagnosis was achieved in 53 cases (41.7%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently isolated pathogen and caused 10.2% of all the cases, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.5%), Haemophilus influenzae (5.5%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (3.9%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.9%). Gram-negative bacilli were significantly more frequently identified in patients aged 60 years or older and in patients with comorbid illnesses. Twelve of 13 patients who died from CAP had other comorbid illnesses compared to 63 of 114 patients who survived (P = 0.014). Three of eight bacteraemic patients died compared with 10 of 119 non-bacteraemic patients (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiology of CAP in patients requiring hospitalization in Malaysia appears to be different from that in Western countries. Gram-negative bacilli were more frequently isolated in older patients and in those with comorbidity. Mortality from CAP is more likely in patients with comorbidity and in those who are bacteraemic.
TI  - Intracranial complications of frontal sinusitis in children: Pott's puffy tumor revisited.
AB  - The objective of the present study is to describe the diagnosis and treatment of  intracranial complications of frontal sinusitis (Pott's puffy tumor) in a series of pediatric patients at our institution. A rare entity, Pott's puffy tumor has been reported in only 21 pediatric cases in the literature of the antibiotic era. The hospital records and radiographic files at Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio, USA, over the previous 16 years were retrospectively reviewed in a search for patients with the diagnosis of Pott's puffy tumor, defined as scalp swelling and associated intracranial infection. There were 6 male patients and 1 female patient. Ages ranged from 11 to 18 years (median 14.5 years). Intracranial infections consisted of epidural abscess in 5 patients, subdural empyema in 4 and brain abscess in 1. Intraoperative cultures grew anaerobic organisms in 1 patient, microaerophilic streptococcus in 5 patients, Klebsiella species in 1 patient and Streptococcus pneumoniae in another. All patients presented with frontal scalp swelling, and other common symptoms included headache, fever, nasal drainage and frontal sinus tenderness. Five patients were treated with antibiotics prior to their presentation. Four patients presented with neurologic decompensation characterized by varying degrees of hemiparesis, obtundation, pupillary dilatation or aphasia. All patients underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the intracranial infection. Even severely impaired patients demonstrated full neurologic recovery. Despite the widespread use of antibiotics, neurosurgical complications of sinusitis continue to occur. A high degree of suspicion, along with prompt neurosurgical intervention and the use of appropriate antibiotics, can result in favorable outcomes in even the sickest patients.
TI  - [Septicemia of dental origin and post-extraction coma. Apropos of 3 cases].
AB  - The authors report 3 cases of septicaemia and coma post dental extraction. These  3 patients had dental extraction in the same confessional dental clinic. After these acts the situation were so severe and they came to central hospital in Yaounde. Infections from dental origin proven by blood culture necessitate an early antibiotherapy and treatment, which propriate and sustain, but adapted to the antibiogram. The streptococcus of group F and Klebsiella pneumonia were challenged. One of the cases was negative. The presence of common signs (fever, tachycardia, chill) need the search for a secondary localisation which can be determine by X-ray.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial activities of Colombian medicinal plants.
AB  - Strong antiviral and antimicrobial activities were detected in methanolic extracts of 24 plants used medicinally in the treatment of skin infections in four different regions of Colombia. Thirteen extracts displayed activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV) whereas none was active against poliovirus. The antiviral activity was indicated by a total inhibition of viral cytopathic effects (CPE) at a non-cytotoxic concentration of the extract. The most potent extract was obtained from Byrsonima verbascifolia (L.) HBK. which showed anti-HSV activity at a concentration as low as 2.5 microg/ml. Antimicrobial screening was conducted using the disc diffusion assay against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium phlei, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and the human pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans. Anti-Candida activity was observed for Piper lanceaefolium HBK. and Juglans neotropica Diels. Twenty-two extracts displayed activity against Gram-positive bacteria whereas none was active against the Gram-negative species. We concluded that these Colombian medicinal plants represent an untapped source of potentially useful antivirals and are worthy of further study.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - Multi-resistance to antimicrobial agents for the ten most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cross-resistance and multi-resistance to selected antibiotics was determined for  Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae often showed cross-resistance to ss-lactam antibiotics. Only 1% of the Escherichia coli isolates showed resistance to more than four antibiotics from a set of seven. This rate was higher for other Enterobacteriaceae and there were high levels of cross-resistance for P. aeruginosa. The cross-resistance of oxacillin with other antibiotics is well known in staphylococci. Penicillin-resistant pneumococcal isolates were cross-resistant to macrolides. Cross-resistance was only a minor problem in H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Cross- and multi-resistance are important problems for Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria but not for fastidious bacteria with the exception of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalent bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis and their antibiotic susceptibility in a referral intensive care unit in Assir Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia, during the years 1993-1998. METHODS: Records of newborn infants with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture during the period were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: There were 1473 nursery admissions, of which 32 episodes of meningitis occurred amongst 31 neonates. Klebsiella pneumoniae (31%) and Serratia marcescens (21%) were the main pathogens. The incidence of concurrent septicemia among these infants was 58%. Klebsiella pneumoniae appears to dominate in both early and late onset infections. The sex incidence was equal and the mortality rate was 48%. CONCLUSION: The survey identifies Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp. as the leading bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis in our environment. The relatively high frequency of Serratia infection in the present survey appears unique as this organism is comparatively rare in other reports across the globe. No Group B Streptococcus was isolated, which is in contrast to reports obtained in Europe, America and Australia where it is the predominant organism of neonatal sepsis or meningitis. Antibiogram identified imipenem and cefotaxime as the empirical antibiotics in infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in our hospital; no more conventional use of ampicillin. In view of the changing bacterial pattern of infant infection with time even in the same environment, a periodic review of this subject is advocated.
TI  - Pulmonary and systemic host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in normal and immunosuppressed mice.
AB  - Mortality related to bacteremic pneumonia remains high, and the role of sepsis in inflammation, pulmonary injury, and death remains unclear, mostly in leukopenic states. In the present study, the microbiology, histopathology, and host response to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection were determined in an experimental model of bacteremia in immunocompetent and leukopenic mice. Leukocyte depletion by cyclophosphamide did not impair the early clearance of pneumococci from blood but facilitated growth in lungs. By contrast, klebsiellae rapidly grew in blood of leukopenic mice. These observations suggest that tissue-based phagocytes and circulating leukocytes, respectively, play prominent roles in S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae eradication. The kinetics of leukocyte recruitment in lungs during S. pneumoniae bacteremia suggested early strong inflammation in immunocompetent mice that is associated with tumor necrosis factor alpha release and histological disorders, including cell debris and surfactant in alveolar spaces. Leukocyte depletion further stimulated pulmonary capillary leakage both in S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae bacteremia, which seemed attributable to bacterial virulence factors. Nitric oxide production did not differ significantly among groups. Leukopenia and low platelet counts characterized the late stage of bacteremia for both strains, but only K. pneumoniae altered renal function. Understanding the pathogenesis of bacteremia will help establish beneficial therapies for both sepsis and pneumonia.
TI  - Bacteriology and beta-lactamase activity in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the bacteriology of beta-lactamase (BL) enzyme activity in  sputum of 40 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB). METHODS: The microbiology, BL production by the different isolates, and BL contents in the sputum were determined. RESULTS: Eighty-four isolates were recovered (2.1 isolates per specimen), 44 aerobic and facultative (1.1 isolates per specimen), and 40 anaerobic (1.0 isolate per specimen). Aerobic bacteria were recovered in only 9 (22.5%) specimens, anaerobic bacteria in 9 (22.5%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in 22 (55%). The predominant aerobic isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 isolates), Haemophilus influenzae (11), Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 each). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (19), Prevotella sp. (11), and Fusobacterium sp.(6). Mixed flora were present in 25 (62.5%) specimens, and the number of isolates varied from 2 to 5 per specimen. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (BLPB) were isolated in 33 (82.5%) of the 40 cases. The predominant aerobic BLPB were H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobic BLPB were Prevotella sp. and Fusobacterium sp. Beta-lactamase activity was detected in 26 (79%) of 33 of specimens in which BLPB were isolated, and in none of the seven specimens that did not harbor BLPB. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid detection of BL activity in sputum specimens may have implications for the antimicrobial management with AECB.
TI  - [Neonatal bacterial infections at the CUH of Dakar].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: It's a retrospective study in order to determine the epidemiology of  neonatal bacterial infection and to evaluate the efficiency of the antibiotic protocol in University Teaching Hospital in Dakar. MATERIAL AND METHODES: From January 1st 1997 to December 31st 1998 we have registered 7461 live births, samples of blood are taken from 2312 new-born baby and they received antibiotherapy (beta-lactamine + gentamycin) at the first day based on infections risk evaluated by anamnestic criterias. The treatment is seven to one days long, the antibiotic was adapted according to the antibiogram result. RESULTS: The neonatal infection diagnosis is confirmed in 246 cases, about 33 per 1000 live births or 10.6% of newborn babies having on antibiotherapy. Most current risk factors are premature rupture of membranes (85%) and neonatal suffering (87.8%). Isolated gerras are: Klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%), Enterobacteria (11.5 Staphylococcus (8.7%), colibacille (6%), Streptococcus (5.5%), Enterococcus (4.1%) and Pseudomonas (2.7%). Most of these germs are resistant to antibiotics currently used in first intention (ampicillin, cefotaxim, gentamycin), in particularly 95% of Klebsiella. Most efficient antibiotics are amikacin, colistin, ceftriaxon and ciprofloxacine. Deaths occurs in 48 cases with 36 in early neonatal period, 79% of mortality rate related to infection by Klebsiella. CONCLUSION: First intention antibiotherapy must be always adapted to the bacterial ecology evolution and must be more selective by using major infections risk factors. We promote early infection diagnosis by using biologic markers which reference is represented by C Reactive Protein.
TI  - New antioxidant and antimicrobial ellagic acid derivatives from Pteleopsis hylodendron.
AB  - Bioassay-guided isolation of two new compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl-4'-O-glucoside ellagic acid (1) and the pteleoellagic acid derivative (2), from the stem bark of Pteleopsis hylodendron is reported along with 3,4-methylenedioxy-3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (3), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (4) and 3,3',4'-tri-O-methyl ellagic acid (5), which were obtained for the first time from this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated with the help of spectroscopic studies. Compounds 1 and 4 were found to have significant antioxidant activity, while compounds 1-4 showed antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  - Effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. This study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with HAP. The mean age of patients was over 70 years. More than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. There was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (APACHE) III score between the HAP-cefepime and HAP-ceftazidime group. The most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with CAP were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). In patients with HAP, P. aeruginosa (n = 13), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), Serratia marcescens (n = 6), K. pneumoniae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), Citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and Escherichia coli (n = 2) were isolated. The cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the CAP-cefepime group, the HAP-cefepime group, and the HAP-ceftazidime group, respectively. The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing CAP and HAP indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.
TI  - The efficacy and safety of two oral moxifloxacin regimens compared to oral clarithromycin in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - An international multi-centre, randomized, prospective, double-blind study compared oral moxifloxacin (200 mg or 400 mg once daily for 10 days) with oral clarithromycin (500 mg, twice daily for 10 days) in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The clinical success rate in the evaluable population at the primary efficacy assessment, 3-5 days after the end of study treatment, was 93.9% in patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin; 94.4%, with 400 mg moxifloxacin; and 94.3%, with clarithromycin. Clinical success rates were maintained at follow-up, 21-28 days after the end of treatment: 90.7% (200 mg moxifloxacin), 92.8% (400 mg moxifloxacin) and 92.2% (clarithromycin). The 95% confidence intervals indicated that all three treatment regimens were equally effective in treating CAP. At follow-up, the 400 mg moxifloxacin dose had a slightly higher observed cure rate than the 200 mg moxifloxacin dose, but this was not statistically significant. The most frequently isolated pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (42%), Haemophilus influenzae (19%), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10%), Moraxella catarrhalis (6%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%). The bacteriological success rate (eradication and presumed eradication) was 72.5% (29/40) for 200 mg moxifloxacin, 78.7% (37/47) for 400 mg moxifloxacin and 70.7% (29/41) for clarithromycin. The adverse event profile was comparable between the three treatment groups. Most adverse events, possibly or probably related to the study drug, were generally mild or moderate in severity and mostly related to the digestive system: diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain in 200 mg moxifloxacin patients; diarrhoea, liver function abnormalities and nausea in 400 mg moxifloxacin patients and liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea and taste perversion in clarithromycin patients. Study drugs were discontinued because of adverse events in 7/229 (3%) patients treated with 200 mg moxifloxacin, 11/224 (5%) with moxifloxacin 400 mg and 11/222 (5%) with clarithromycin. In all assessments, moxifloxacin was at least as effective clinically, and as well tolerated as clarithromycin in the treatment of CAP. Bacteriological success rates in moxifloxacin-treated patients were greater than those of clarithromycin. Moxifloxacin, given once daily, is free of many drug-drug interactions and requires no dosage adjustments in most renal hepatic deficient patients.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of certain quinolone derivatives.
AB  - A number of 7-substituted quinolone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities. Preliminary results indicated that most compounds tested in this study demonstrated better activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than norfloxacin. Among them, 1-(4-amino-2-fluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-hydro xyiminoethyl]-1-piperazinyl]-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid (11d) and its ketone precursor 10d exhibited significant activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, erythromycin- and ampicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis. Due to strong cytotoxicities of 11d (a mean log GI(50) of -5.40), compound 10d, with good antibacterial activities and low cytotoxicities (a mean log GI(50) of -4.67), is a more potential drug candidate.
TI  - [Post-traumatic bacterial meningitis].
AB  - 10 patients with posttraumatic bacterial meningitis were treated in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the Jagielloniam University--Collegium Medicum during the period of 63 months. Traffic accidents were responsible for 80% of all cases of trauma. The most common place of injury was the base of anterior cranial fossa. Infecting agent was established in 8 cases. Gram-positive aerobic cocci (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus spp.) were found in 4 patients, Gram-negative aerobic cocci (Neisseria meningitidis) in 2 patients, and Gram-negative aerobic rods (Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli) in 3 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was still highly sensitive to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Neisseria meningitidis was sensitive to penicillin, cefotaxime, amoxicillin/clavulonate. Gram negative aerobic rods were sensitive to third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Among 10 patients treated for posttraumatic bacterial meningitis 1 patient died and in 1 preserved vegetative state was diagnosed. In 4 patients severe or moderate disabilities developed, however 4 recovered completely. 6 patients after regression of the CNS infection were qualified to neurosurgical intervention. In 3 patients reconstructive operation of the basis of anterior cranial fossa with tissue glue Beriplast P. was done, the recovery was complete. 3 patients didn't agree to surgical operation, and we don't know what has happened with them. They have not come to the control visit.
TI  - Crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity of grepafloxacin, ofloxacin and clarithromycin against respiratory pathogens after oral administration to healthy volunteers.
AB  - Serum bactericidal activity was studied in a crossover manner in 10 volunteers, after 2-day administration of grepafloxacin 600 mg qd, ofloxacin 400 mg bid and clarithromycin 500 mg bid. Bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was estimated using a standardized microdilution method. Grepafloxacin was highly active against Gram-negative organisms and adequate against pneumococci (mean, 1:13.3). Clarithromycin was very active against both penicillin-susceptible and penicillin-partially-resistant S. pneumoniae (1:102.5) but had poor activity against H. influenzae (1:3.1). Minor adverse effects were commonly associated with grepafloxacin.
TI  - [Pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility in uropathogen isolates from children].
AB  - The bacteriological profile in children with culture-positive bacteriuria was analyzed during a 5-year period. Escherichia coli was the most common cause of urinary tract infections (57%), followed by Streptococcus faecalis (11%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), and Proteus mirabilis (6%). Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that cephalosporins (first, second and third generation) and nitrofurantoin are the best empirical oral treatment for urinary infections in children. Fosfomycin is a valid option in some cases. In hospitalized children treatment must be initiated with a third-generation cephalosporin, and gentamicin can be added in severely ill inpatients. These treatments can be modified when microbiological results become available.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate and thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate and other antimicrobials against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Thiamphenicol-glycinate-acetylcysteinate (TGA; CAS 20192-91-0) is widely used for the treatment of infections of varied aetiology. The aim of this study was to compare the antibacterial activity of thiamphenicol-glycinate (TG; CAS 15318-45-3), TGA, amoxicillin (CAS 61336-70-7) plus clavulanic acid (CAS 58001-44-8), azithromycin (CAS 83905-01-5) and ceftriaxone (CAS 104376-79-6). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) methods. The effects of changes in assay conditions were also examined. The activity of TG and TGA was similar to that of amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, with the exception of methicillin resistant S. aureus. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were characterised by a limited activity against gram-positive cocci and methicillin resistant and cefinase-positive S. aureus, respectively. TG and TGA are characterized by a wide spectrum of activity, comparable to that of recent commercialized antibiotics for treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Clinical and experimental studies in treating infantile acute respiratory tract  infection with feiyan chuansou oral liquid].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutical mechanism of Feiyan Chuansou Oral Liquid (FCOL) in treating infantile acute respiratory trct infection. METHODS: Clinical and experimental studies with FCOL in treating infantile acute respiratory tract infection. RESULTS: The clinical result showed that the antitussive, expectorant, anti-asthmatic effect and resolution of dry and moist rale and wheezing of FCOL were significantly better in treatment group than those in the control group (P < 0.05). Animal experimental results also showed that antitussive, expectorant, anti-asthmatic effect of FCOL were significantly better than those of the control group (P < 0.05-0.001). Bacteriostatic test in vitro showed that FCOL could inhibit streptococcus pneumoniae, klebsiella pneumoniae, influenza bacilli and staphylococcus aureus. Antivirologic test showed that FCOL could inhibit completely the influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSION: FCOL is an effective preparation in treating infantile acute respiratory infection.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - Effect of different antibacterial agents and surfactant protein-A (SP-A) on adherence of some respiratory pathogens to bronchial epithelial cells.
AB  - Some antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations are able to alter bacterial surface structures and modulate adhesiveness by affecting the expression of microbial adhesins. An important mechanism of pulmonary defence against pathogens is SP-A, one of the proteins of the alveolar surfactant having opsonizing activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect that sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics and physiological concentrations of SP-A (1 and 5 microg/ml) could exert on the adherence of respiratory pathogens to the bronchial epithelial cell line, WI26VA4. Cefdinir and clarithromycin showed high efficacy, mainly at 1/2 MIC, in reducing the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains to values lower or equal to 50% of the control; sparfloxacin showed the same effect on S. aureus and S. pneumoniae but teicoplanin only on S. pneumoniae. Other similar results were observed with netilmicin on Klebsiella pneumoniae (40%) and with cefepime and ciprofloxacin on Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60%). Clarithromycin reduced the adherence of K. pneumoniae to 80% although it is not active against this strain. Adherence of the test strains was not modified by SP-A alone or in combination with any of the antibiotics used.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization classified by age group].
AB  - We classified 1017 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization experienced in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital during the past 15 years into five age groups (< or = 54 years old, 55-64 years old, 65-74 years old, 75-84 years old, > or = 85 years old). With particular emphasis on the elderly patients, we then compared the clinical and microbiological findings in the five groups. The results were as follows; (1) Half of patients in the over 85 years old group were bed-ridden. (2) The proportion receiving antibiotics before hospitalization decreased with age. (3) There were striking atypical pneumonic symptoms, such as dyspnea and consciousness disturbance in the two age groups over 75 years old. (4) Hypotension (shock) increased with age. (5) Markers of nutritional conditions, such as serum protein, albumin, cholinesterase, and hypoxia remarkably increased in the two age groups over 75 years old. (6) There were no significant differences in the isolation rate of etiological microorganisms. (7) The number of polymicrobial agents in the < or = 54 years old group was lower than that in the other age groups. (8) Mycoplasma pneumoniae was most significantly higher in < or = 54 years old group, Haemophilus influenzae in patients 55-64 years old, and Streptococcus pneumoniae in both 65-74 and 75-84 years old groups. (9) The isolation rate of MSSA, gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respiratory viruses increased with age. (10) The amount of sepsis increased with age. (11) The prognosis was poor in the two groups over 75 years old because the mortality rate (over 10%) was higher that for the other age groups.
TI  - Integration of molecular characterization of microorganisms in a global antimicrobial resistance surveillance program.
AB  - The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program has incorporated molecular strain typing and resistance genotyping as a means of providing additional information that may be useful for understanding pathogenic microorganisms worldwide. Resistance phenotypes of interest include multidrug-resistant pathogens, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) strains of gram-negative bacilli and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Clusters of > or =2 isolates within a given resistance profile that are linked temporally and by hospital location are flagged for DNA fingerprinting. Further characterization of organisms with respect to resistance genotype is accomplished with use of polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. This process has been highly successful in identifying clonal spread within clusters of multiresistant pathogens. Between 50% and 90% of MRSA clusters identified by phenotypic screening contained evidence of clonal spread. Among the Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL-producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the most common pathogens causing clusters of infection, and approximately 50% of recognized clusters demonstrate clonal spread. Clusters of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia have been noted with clonal spread among patients with urinary tract, respiratory, and bloodstream infections. Characterization of mutations in the FQR-determining region of phenotypically susceptible isolates of E. coli and S. pneumoniae has identified first-stage mutants among as many as 40% of isolates. The ability to characterize organisms phenotypically and genotypically is extremely powerful and provides unique information that is important in a global antimicrobial surveillance program.
TI  - Effect of some fractions of alveolar surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of physiologic concentrations, at alveolar level, of some fractions of pulmonary surfactant (phospholipids and SP-A) on the bactericidal activity of different antimicrobials against some respiratory pathogens. METHODS: The antimicrobial agents cefdinir, sparfloxacin, clarithromycin, teicoplanin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, netilmicin and tobramycin, depending on their specific activity, were investigated against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Killing curves were carried out with antimicrobials at 0.5 and 2 MIC, SP-A at 1 and 5 mg/L and phospholipids at 50 mg/L. RESULTS: Time-kill experiments showed that while SP-A never modified the activity of antimicrobials, phospholipids exerted, in some cases, a weak antagonistic effect. Among antibacterials and pathogens investigated, phospholipids were able to decrease the rate of killing of cefepime and ciprofloxacin only on P. aeruginosa, both at 0.5 and at 2 MIC, with an increase of about 1 log in CFU. The combination of SP-A and phospholipids never modified the effect observed in the presence of lipids alone. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity of data only allow us to observe that the examined antibiotics do not have substantially reduced activity against respiratory pathogens studied in the presence of physiologic concentrations of some fractions of surfactant. Cefepime alone already exerted a small effect, and ciprofloxacin at 2 MIC, even in the presence of phospholipids, retained its bactericidal activity.
TI  - [Identification of microbial subtypes from antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical laboratory for nosocomial infection surveillance].
AB  - We developed an algorism to identify microbial subtypes automatically from daily  antibiotic susceptibility data in clinical microbiology laboratory. The susceptibility pattern was expressed as a string of digits, each consisting of 0(resistant), 1(intermediate) or 2(susceptible) to respective antibiotics. Any two patterns were regarded identical and combined if the difference at each digit never exceeds 1. The combined pattern was expressed as an array of digit-by-digit weighted averages of the two. The second combination was based on a degree of similarity among the numerical patterns using a formula, which was designed to emphasize differences in highly variable elements. This subgrouping procedure was done every three months. Identity of the detected subtypes between the intervals was determined using the same algorism as for the second combination. The algorism was applied to data of clinical isolates of MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Enterococcus faecalis (EF), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), Escherichia coli (EC) that were obtained over a period of 4 years. Three major subtypes of MRSA, KP and EF were consistently detected with shifting mutual frequencies. Most of EC isolates belonged to two consistent subtypes. Although PA and SP had one or two consistent subtypes, there were multiple minor subtypes of varying frequencies. This analysis is regarded as an "infotyping", in contrast to serotype or genotype, of clinical microbial isolates, which is useful for nosocomial infection surveillance.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetics of SC-002 and its derivative, SC-004: new oral cephalosporins.
AB  - SC-002 is a novel oral cephalosporin possessing a unique thiadiazolylethenyl moiety at the 3 position. In the present study, it was the most active against gram-positive bacteria among oral cephalosporins such as cefdinir (CFDN), cefpodoxime, cefditoren and cefaclor (CCL). It was equal to or 16 times more active than CFDN against standard and clinical strains. In particular, against clinical isolates of Morganella morganii and Haemophilus influenzae, SC-002 was 8-64 times more active than CFDN. The antibacterial activity of SC-002 against some beta-lactam-resistant strains was superior to that of CFDN. The in vivo antibacterial activity of SC-004, a pivaloyloxymethyl ester of SC-002, was 1.2-8 times more protective against systemic infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae than that of CFDN. The therapeutic effects of SC-004 on experimental respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae were superior to those of CFDN and CCL. SC-004 showed higher and longer-lasting blood levels and higher urinary excretion in pharmacokinetics in mice.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Streblus asper leaf extract.
AB  - Bactericidal activity was found in the 50% ethanol (v/v) extract of Streblus asper leaves. The extract possessed a selective bactericidal activity towards Streptococcus, especially to Streptococcus mutans which has been shown to be strongly associated with dental caries. The extract had no effect on cultures of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus coagulase positive, Staphylococcus coagulase negative, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia pseudomeallei and Candida albicans. The minimum growth inhibitory concentration and the minimum bactericidal concentration of S. asper extract against 10(8) CFU/mL of S. mutans was 2 mg/mL. The active compound is partially polar, partially heat labile, precipitated by 80% ammonium sulphate, and possesses a molecular weight larger than 10 000 Da. The potential for using S. asper extract as a natural product for controlling dental caries is discussed.
TI  - Interaction of bladder glycoprotein GP51 with uropathogenic bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: A major component of bladder surface mucin is a glycoprotein GP51 (molecular weight 51 kD.). GP51, which has previously been isolated from rabbit mucosa, appears to function as part of the defense mechanism in an in vivo infection model. GP51 coats the epithelium and is secreted into the urine, as detected by immunohistochemical testing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Increased urinary GP51 occurs during urinary tract infection. To elucidate the role of GP51 as a component of the primary defense mechanism we studied interactions with uropathogenic bacterial isolates and urine from symptomatic patients with urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELISA was performed to demonstrate the binding of GP51 and various uropathogens. Immunochemical studies were done using monoclonal antibodies to GP51 to determine the interaction of GP51 with certain uropathogenic isolates, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis. Infected urinary sediments and uropathogenic bacterial cultures were examined by immunocytochemical testing to localize GP51. Antigen inhibition ELISA was done to quantitate urinary GP51 in the urine of 17 normal controls and 19 patients with urinary tract infection. RESULTS: ELISA revealed that GP51 binds to a wide spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative uropathogens in semiquantitative fashion. Immunochemical methods confirmed that purified GP51 binds to bacteria, encapsulating and aggregating the bacteria. Clinical specimens showed GP51 localized to bacteria and uroepithelial cells. We observed a significant increase in urinary GP51 in urinary tract infection compared to uninfected urine (p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that GP51, a component of bladder mucin, may be a strategic factor in the primary defense mechanism of the bladder.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 41 antimicrobials tested against over 2773 bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with pneumonia: I--results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (North America, 1998).
AB  - Pneumonia is the second most frequent cause of nosocomial infection, and hospitalization frequently is needed for community-acquired pneumonia. Knowledge of causative pathogens through periodic surveillance, and their prevailing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns becomes paramount in choosing appropriate empiric therapy. The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, tracks pathogen distribution worldwide since 1997 and documents emerging resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents. During the respiratory disease season in 1998, each of 30 medical centers (25 in the United States [US], and five in Canada [CAN]) contributed 100 consecutive isolates obtained from hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia. The 2773 organisms, processed by the monitor consisted of a total of 35 species, with Staphylococcus aureus comprising 25.6% of all isolates and five other species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18.7%, Haemophilus influenzae 9.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7.8%, Klebsiella spp. 7.0%, and Enterobacter spp. 6.7%) making up almost 50% of the total. In the US, pneumococci (8.5%) were more prevalent than in CAN (4.1%; p = 0.001). The US isolates of S. pneumoniae were variably susceptible to penicillin (76.8%), with non-susceptible strains demonstrating greater levels of cross resistance to macrolides (31.8%), cefepime (9.0%) and cefotaxime (6.8%), but remaining susceptible to gatifloxacin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were generally ampicillin-resistant, 40.4-44.4% and 93.7-95.7%, respectively. P. aeruginosa remained very susceptible to amikacin (91.3-93.8%) > tobramycin > meropenem > piperacillin/tazobactam > gentamicin > piperacillin > cefepime (80.0-81.8%). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase phenotypes among the Klebsiella spp. were isolated from five medical centers in the US and were 4.8-6.0% overall; a rate similar to the previous year. Among the US isolates of Enterobacter spp., only 77.6% and 79.6% were susceptible to ceftazidime and cefotaxime, respectively, but >90% were inhibited by cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones. Isolates from CAN were generally more susceptible, except for Pseudomonas isolates, where resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and imipenem was greater. The SENTRY Program results outline important national differences in the frequencies of pathogen occurrence, but more importantly, identify unstable patterns of resistance to available antimicrobial drugs, and serves as a reference for results of other local, national or international investigations.
TI  - Modulation of colonic barrier function by the composition of the commensal flora  in the rat.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Altered intestinal permeability is a key pathogenetic factor of idiopathic bowel inflammation. We investigated in the rat if changes in the composition of the bowel flora can alter colonic permeability. METHODS: A colonic segment was surgically excluded from faecal transit and brought out as a loop to the abdominal wall through two colostomies. The loop was used for colonisation with specific bacterial strains after eradication of the native flora with antibiotics. Lumen to blood clearance of dextran (molecular weight 70 000) and mannitol (molecular weight 182) was measured in rats recolonised with a single bacterial strain from rat colonic origin, and in control rats whose colonic loop was kept free of bacteria by antibiotics. Actual colonisation was confirmed by culture of segment effluents. RESULTS: Colonisation with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus viridans significantly increased lumen to blood clearance of mannitol. Colonisation with Lactobacillus brevis had the opposite effect and reduced permeability to mannitol. Bacteroides fragilis did not induce significant changes. Permeability to dextran was not altered by any of the strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Certain commensal bacteria can modify colonic wall permeability to luminal substances.
TI  - Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The trauma intensive care unit (ICU) of a 1500-bed tertiary-care hospital. PATIENTS: All critically ill trauma patients (n = 103) admitted consecutively between November 1995 and October 1996. INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of data recorded at the time of ICU admission and during the clinical evolution in patients with (n = 23) and without (n = 80) nosocomial pneumonia was made. Data referred mainly to possible risk factors were recorded; they also included factors related to pneumonia etiology and evolutive factors. Predictors of nosocomial pneumonia were assessed by logistic regression analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The presence of significant growth on quantitative cultures of the protected specimen brush (> or = 103 colony forming units/mL) was required to accept pneumonia as microbiologically proven, as well as the concurrence of a cohort of clinical and radiologic signs. Twenty-three (22.3%) patients developed nosocomial pneumonia. The mean age of these patients was 41.7 yrs; 18 of them (78.3%) were men. The microorganisms isolated in significant concentrations were Acinetobacter baumanii (ten cases), Staphylococcus aureus (11 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (five cases), Haemophilus influenzae (two cases), and Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacter spp., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus intermedius (one case each one). Risk factors for pneumonia by univariate analysis included nasogastric tube; continuous enteral feeding; prolonged mechanical ventilation (>1 day); use of H2-receptor antagonist, sucralfate, muscle relaxants, corticosteroids, barbiturates, and inotropic agents; positive end-expiratory pressure; intense sedation; re-intubation; tracheotomy; urgent brain computed tomography (CT) scan; craniotomy; iatrogenic event; and hyperventilation. The mortality rate was 43.5% (10 of 23) in the nosocomial pneumonia group and 18.8% in patients without nosocomial pneumonia (p =.02). Also, the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge (measured with total and mean punctuation of the Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System) and the complications, infectious and noninfectious, of the clinical evolution were significantly more frequent in patients with nosocomial pneumonia than in those without pneumonia (p <.05). In the multivariate analysis, continuous enteral feeding, craniotomy, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>24 hrs), use of positive end-expiratory pressure, and corticotherapy were independent predictors of nosocomial pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that factors related to the patient's clinical course, rather than variables registered on the first days of ICU admission, are those that would exert an influence on the development of nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill trauma patients. In this way, from our point of view, in our study the main risk factors are the use of prolonged mechanical ventilation (>4 hrs) and positive end-expiratory pressure. At the same time, we can conclude that the reduction of this infection incidence could decrease the mean stay in the ICU, the therapeutic charge, and the prognosis in terms of mortality and morbidity.
TI  - Systemic antibiotics fail to clear multidrug-resistant Klebsiella from a pediatric ICU.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the magnitude of infection rate and antimicrobial  resistance in a pediatric ICU (PICU), and to evaluate the efficacy of using broad-spectrum antibiotics. DESIGN: A 3-month, prospective, observational cohort audit. SETTING: A 12-bed tertiary, referral PICU. PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: All children admitted to the PICU for > 72 h. INTERVENTIONS: Surveillance cultures of throat and rectum on admission and once weekly thereafter. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 150 admissions during the 3-month period, a total of 52 patients (24 girls and 28 boys) requiring mechanical ventilation for a minimum of 3 days were enrolled in the audit. The median age and interquartile range (IQR) was 17 months (IQR, 5.8 to 63); length of stay, 6.5 days (IQR, 4 to 13); ventilation days, 5 (IQR, 3 to 11); pediatric risk of mortality score, 14 (IQR, 9 to 19); and risk of mortality, 0.03 (IQR, 0.014 to 0.087). Fifteen patients (29%) developed 21 infections, mainly lower-airway infections and septicemias. Of the 52 children, 7 children carried multidrug-resistant bacteria and 3 patients progressed to develop four infections with those resistant bacteria. Of the seven carriers, six patients carried gentamicin-resistant Klebsiella. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and gentamicin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa each were carried by one child. Six of those nine resistant isolates were present in the admission flora. Despite the potent combination of piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin, three children acquired the multidrug-resistant Klebsiella while in the PICU and became nosocomial carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Only surveillance cultures allow the distinction between import of multidrug-resistance and resistant bacteria acquired while in PICU. In this study, two thirds of the resistant isolates were imported. The introduction of newer potent systemic antibiotic combinations failed to control the endemic reservoir of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella and suggests that such policies have little impact.
TI  - Bacteraemia and mortality among adult medical admissions in Malawi--predominance  of non-typhi salmonellae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The high seroprevalence of HIV in Malawi might be expected to alter the pattern of pathogens isolated from bacteraemic patients. We aimed to describe the frequency and seasonal pattern of bacterial isolates from blood, their antibiotic susceptibility, and patient outcome, in order to provide data on which to base empirical antibiotic therapy and further studies of pathogenesis. METHODS: Over a 12-month period, blood cultures were taken from all febrile adult medical admissions to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre. RESULTS: A total of 2789 out of 9298 adult general medical admissions had blood culture performed, of whom 449 (16.1%) grew significant pathogens. Non-typhi salmonellae (NTS) (37%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (30%) were the two commonest isolates. Mortality was 18% among general medical admissions and 38% among bacteraemic patients. Mortality for individual pathogens was: NTS 33%; S. pneumoniae 36%; Escherichia coli 54%; Klebsiella spp. 58%; Neisseria meningitidis 44%; Salmonella typhi 17%. Despite an overwhelming association between the major pathogens and HIV infection (95% of S. pneumoniae cases and 92% of NTS cases were seropositive for HIV), a seasonal pattern was preserved. Streptococcus pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in the cold dry months, while STM isolates increased following a rise in temperature. A case of bacteraemia with Vibrio cholerae (serotype 01) was detected during a cholera outbreak in the rainy season. Although S. pneumoniae isolates were relatively susceptible to penicillin (88%) and chloramphenicol (74%), S. typhimurium isolates were fully susceptible only to chloramphenicol. CONCLUSIONS: This large study confirms the dominance of NTS and S. pneumoniae in bacteraemia in an area affected by HIV-1 and allows comparison of mortality by individual pathogens. It demonstrates a preserved seasonal pattern of bacteraemia for these major pathogens, despite an overwhelming association with HIV infection.
TI  - Common bacteria whose susceptibility to antimicrobials is no longer predictable.
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has been responsible for the development of numerous problems including the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria, increased number of nosocomial- and community-acquired infections, less than optimal patient outcome, and increased health care costs. Of equal concern is the emergence of resistance in clinical isolates to antibiotics that were once considered "standard" with predictable in vitro susceptibility patterns. Such resistance has been especially notable in organisms that are commonly encountered in a variety of infections including, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. It is important for the clinical microbiology laboratory to provide the practicing clinician with accurate and timely antimicrobial susceptibility information which requires the application of standardized and approved in vitro testing methods. The laboratory also serves as a sentinel by maintaining an active monitoring and surveillance program in which current in vitro susceptibility patterns can be compared with local, regional, and national data bases.
TI  - Seven-year study of bacteraemic pneumonia in a single institution.
AB  - In order to enhance current knowledge of nosocomial and community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia in a single tertiary hospital in Israel, a 7-year study was conducted. Using a computerised database, all patients who had bacteraemic pneumonia from March 1988 to August 1995 were studied. During the study period, pneumonia was the source of bacteraemia in 319 of 4,548 (7%) episodes, occurring in 295 patients; 211 (66%) episodes were community-acquired and 108 (34%) were nosocomial. The microoroganisms isolated most frequently from patients with community-acquired bacteraemic pneumonia were Streptococcus pneumoniae (46%), Staphylococcus aureus (10%) and Haemophilus influenzae (8%); while Pseudomonas spp. (17%), Klebsiella spp. (11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%) were isolated most often from the patients with nosocomial bacteraemic pneumonia. The median age of patients was 68 years (range, 0.003-100). The overall mortality was 34%. No significant difference was found between the mortality rates of patients with community-acquired (31%) and nosocomial (40%) bacteraemic pneumonia (P=0.1). Multivariate analysis showed that hypothermia, respiratory failure, impaired consciousness, tracheal intubation, Staphylococcus aureus aetiology, septic shock, inappropriate empiric antibiotic treatment and age significantly increased mortality.
TI  - Synthesis and microbiological activity of some N-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamides and  phenylacetamides as the possible metabolites of antimicrobial active benzoxazoles: part II.
AB  - The synthesis of some N-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamides and benzacetamides (2a-2p) in order to determine their in vitro antimicrobial activity against two Gram-positive bacteria, three Gram-negative bacteria and the fungus Candida albicans is described. The new compounds were compared with several control drugs. The derivative 2g, 4-amino-N-(o-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide, was found active at an MIC value of 25 microg/ml against the Gram-negative microorganism Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most of the compounds exhibited antibacterial activity at an MIC value of 25 microg/ml against Pseudomonas aureginosa. For the antifungal activity against C. albicans, compounds 2e, 2h and 2m were found more active than the other derivatives (MIC 12.5 microg/ml). The antimicrobial activity of some of these benzamide and phenylacetamide derivatives (2a, 2b, 2f, 2g, 2h and 2k), possible metabolites of benzoxazoles, was also compared with that of the cyclic analogues 3-8. Compound 2f possesses two dilutions better antifungal activity than its cyclic analogue the benzoxazole derivative 5 against C. albicans, while having one dilution better antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecalis and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Intravenous followed by oral ofloxacin in the treatment of community acquired lower respiratory tract infections in adults requiring hospitalisation.
AB  - Forty patients were treated with ofloxacin for community acquired lower respiratory tract infections. Eighteen pathogens were isolated in sputum; Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) and Haemophilus influenzae (4) were the most common, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Klebsiella spp. (2), Staphylococcus anreus (2), Pseudomonas spp. (2), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Ofloxacin 200 mg every 12 hours was administered for an average of 3.7 days intravenously followed by 5.4 days orally. Response to therapy was judged to be cure in 38 (95%; 95% C.I., 85%-95%) patients, failure in one (2.5%) and "indeterminate" in one (2.5%).
TI  - [Microbiology of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis and treatment with Taileqi troches].
AB  - A qualitative analysis of microflora from pharynx of 100 cases of acute pharyngitis and acute tonsillitis was performed. These patients were randomly divided into two groups so as to assess treatment effect of Taileqi troches vs Amoxycillin. Results showed that beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus were the most common organisms causing diseases. The predominant anaerobic organisms were bacteroides melaninogenicus, eptostrep. These findings suggest that anaerobic bacteria may play a pathogenic role in infection of the pharynx. The effective rate of treatment with troche alone were 86 percent, roughly consistent with Amoxycillin group. No adverse effect was observed.
TI  - Isolation and identification of bacteria associated with adult laboratory Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae).
AB  - From the guts of new and old colonies (female and male) of Mexican fruit flies, Anastrepha ludens (Diptera: Tephritidae), we identified a total of 18 different bacterial species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Micrococcaceae, Deinococcacea, Bacillaceae, and the genus Listeria. Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated genera, with Citrobacter, Streptococcus, Aerococcus, and Listeria found less frequently. We found Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter sakazakii, Providencia stuartii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa only in the new colony, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae spp. pneumoniae only in the old colony. We also studied resistance/sensitivity to 12 antibiotics for six bacterial isolates such as Enterobacter cloacae, E. sakazakii, K. pneumoniae spp., Providencia rettgeri, P. aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus. Isolates on the whole were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin (five of six isolates) and sensitive to rifampin and streptomycin (six of six isolates). Antibiotic resistance profiles might be useful characteristics for distinguishing among species and strains of these bacteria, probably having ecological significance with respect to intra- and inter-specific competition within host cadavers, and could have implications for the utility of these organisms for biological control, including the alternative control strategy, paratransgenesis.
TI  - Resistance patterns among nosocomial pathogens: trends over the past few years.
AB  - Multiple surveillance studies have demonstrated that resistance among prevalent pathogens is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to greater patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial infections. Among Gram-positive organisms, the most important resistant pathogens are methicillin- (oxacillin-)resistant Staphylococcus aureus, beta-lactam-resistant and multidrug-resistant pneumococci, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Important causes of Gram-negative resistance include extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis, high-level third-generation cephalosporin (Amp C) beta-lactamase resistance among Enterobacter species and Citrobacter freundii, and multidrug-resistance genes observed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. In selecting an empiric treatment for a nosocomial infection, one should consider the prevalent resistance patterns. Antimicrobials used for the treatment of nosocomial infections should be effective against any likely resistant pathogens and should not further promote the development of resistance. Recent data suggest that because of ESBLs and high-level amp C beta-lactamase resistances, use of third-generation cephalosporins may be ineffective in many patients with nosocomial infections. In addition, use of these agents may allow overgrowth of inherently resistant enterococci. The role of fluoroquinolones in the empiric treatment of nosocomial infections is also being limited by new resistance patterns and increasing resistance levels. Available antimicrobials with good activity against many resistant pathogens include the carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and cefepime. In addition, several new agents with good activity against Gram-positive organisms are in development or have been recently released. Appropriate antimicrobial selection, surveillance systems, and effective infection-control procedures are key partners in limiting antimicrobial-resistant pathogen occurrence and spread.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--the antibiotic era: a multicenter study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical course and identify the causative organisms  of acute mastoiditis in a community where most of the patients who develop acute otitis media are treated with antibiotics. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective review of a series of 223 consecutive cases of acute mastoiditis. SETTING: Nine secondary or tertiary academic or non-academic referral centers. RESULTS: Prior to the diagnosis of acute mastoiditis, 121 of the patients (54.3%) had been receiving oral antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media for periods ranging from 1 to 21 days (mean 5.3 days). Samples for bacterial culture were obtained from 152 patients. Cultures were negative in 60 patients. The organisms isolated in the 92 positive cultures were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 patients), Streptococcus pyogenes (14 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (13 patients), Staphylococcus coagulase negative (three patients), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (eight patients), Haemophilus influenzae (four patients), Proteus mirabilis (two patients), Escherichia coli (two patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Enterobacter (one patient), Acinetobacter (one patient), anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (one patient), and fungi (two patients). Ten patients had mixed flora. Sixteen patients presented with complications (cerebellar abscess, perisinus empyema, subdural abscess or empyema, extradural abscess, cavernous sinus thrombosis, lateral sinus thrombosis, bacterial meningitis, labyrinthitis, petrositis, or facial nerve palsy). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic treatment cannot be considered an absolute safeguard against the development of acute mastoiditis. Early myringotomy for acute otitis media seems to decrease the incidence of complications. The distribution of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis differs from that in acute otitis media. Intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis are not rare. Because of the diversity of causative organisms in acute mastoiditis and the growing resistance of bacteria to the various antibiotics, all means to obtain a sample for culture prior to antibiotic treatment, including general anesthesia.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone against respiratory pathogens  in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model simulating concentration-time curves.
AB  - The duration of time that serum levels are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; T >MIC) seems to be an important pharmacodynamic parameter for beta-lactams. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bactericidal activity of cefodizime and ceftriaxone in a pharmacokinetic model mimicking the concentrations in bronchial mucus and in serum (total and free) obtained at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 h, after 1 g i.m. administration once daily. The species investigated were respiratory pathogens (1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain b-lactamase negative and 1 strain beta-lactamase positive of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 strain of Escherichia coli and 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae); MIC50s of the chosen strains were reported. In this in vitro model the concentrations (serum and bronchial mucus) for both antibiotics are generally at or above the MIC values of the tested strains until 24 hours. The killing curve showed rapid killing for both antibiotics: 99.9% killing (a 3-log reduction in growth) within 6 to 8 h, depending upon the microorganism tested. There was no significant difference in the log kill between cefodizime and ceftriaxone. These data confirm that T >MIC for beta-lactams is the pharmacodynamic parameter which best correlates with bactericidal efficacy. On the basis of the killing curve determined for cefodizime versus ceftriaxone at concentrations that these antibiotics can reach during therapy with 1 g i.m. once daily we expect reasonable clinical efficacy with monoadministration of cefodizime as well as for ceftriaxone in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated in cases of pertussis-like syndrome].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the etiologic study of the pertussis-like syndrome, not only as far as Bordetella genus is concerned but also regarding the causative role of other microorganisms for a 11-year period (1988-1998). METHODS: In all specimens from patients suffering from pertussis-like cough the presence of Bordetella spp., other bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma was investigated. The analysed data included microbiological findings and epidemiologic issues (age, sex, hospital admission area, yearly distribution and seasonal period). RESULTS: A total of 1,063 specimens were investigated, most of them nasopharyngeal aspirates (910), corresponding to 905 patients; a positive culture was obtained form 56.9 of these patients. B. pertussis was isolated from 10.5% of patients. As for other bacteria, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were also isolated, in 16.9% and 15.8% of occasions, respectively. The respiratory syncitial virus was isolated from 10.7% of patients and other viruses in 9.4%. Among mycoplasma, Ureaplasma urealyticum predominated, with a recovery rate of 2.9%. The male/female ratio was 495/410; the ages of 67.2% of patients ranged from 0 to 6 months; a total of 689 (76.1%) required hospital admission. The recovery of B. pertussis and adenoviruses predominated during spring and summer months. In contrast, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and respiratory syncitial virus were recovered more frequently during winter months. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with pertussis-like syndrome are children aged less than 6 months. The recovery percentages of B. pertussis and respiratory syncitial virus are identical and therefore we think that the investigation of their presence in this syndrome is fully warranted as well as the search for other microorganisms, since clinical symptoms are commonly non-specific among infants.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Infections in E-beta thalassemia.
AB  - Infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially E-beta thalassemia. The spectrum of infections in E-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as Yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (DFO) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. Prospective studies in Thailand indicate that patients with E-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. The former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. Severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. Responsible organisms were Escherichia coli (26%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), Salmonella (15%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). Other organisms included Pseudomonas, Staphylococci, Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and Aeromonas. Patients undergoing DFO therapy are at risk for Y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as septicemia. Recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. Patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. The causative organism, Pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom Stramenopila, and in the class Oomycetes. The mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. The predisposing factors of infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. General management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis dry extract.
AB  - In this study the antibacterial and antifungal properties of propolis, a natural  product of bees, have been investigated against different pathogens. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined according to NCCLS standards on 320 strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Time-kill curves were assessed for susceptible microorganisms, testing 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 x MIC for propolis, by counting viable bacteria after 0, 3, 6, 24 hours and viable yeasts after 0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 hours. Propolis showed good antimicrobial activity against most of the isolates, particularly S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, but not against Enterobacteriaceae. Time-kill curves demonstrated bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal activity of propolis, the latter being evident only at high concentrations.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of L-084, a novel oral carbapenem,  against causative organisms of respiratory tract infections.
AB  - L-084 (a prodrug of LJC 11,036 [L-036]) is a new oral carbapenem. Here we compared the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of L-036 with those of imipenem, faropenem, ceditoren-pivoxil, cefdinir, amoxicillin, and levofloxacin. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited of L-036 against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae including penicillin-resistant organisms, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin-resistant organisms, Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis were equal to or less than 1 microg/ml. In pharmacokinetics studies of L-084 in lungs of mice, the maximum concentration in serum, half-life, and area under the concentration-time curve of this drug were 9.09 microg/g of tissue, 6.18 h, and 31.0 microg. h/ml, respectively. In murine respiratory infection models of penicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, the efficacies of L-084 were better than those of reference drugs. Our results indicate that the in vitro high potency and good distribution in the lungs might be the underlying mechanisms of its efficacy in the murine model of pneumonia.

TI  - Adult bacterial meningitis in Southern Taiwan: epidemiologic trend and prognostic factors.
AB  - In two investigative phases over a 13.5-year study period (January 1986-June 1999), 202 adult patients with culture-proven bacterial meningitis were enrolled in this study. In order to determine the epidemiologic trend, prognostic factors and therapeutic results for this disease. Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the three most commonly revealed pathogens, accounting for about 48% of the episodes. Although there was a change in relative frequency for the pathogens, K. pneumoniae remained the most prevalent during the two periods studied (January 1986-December 1992 and January 1993-June 1999). Multiantibiotic resistant strains have been in evidence since their appearance in 1994, with most of our patients acquiring their infection nosocomially. The overall mortality rates during the two periods were 40% and 34%, respectively. In stepwise logistic regression analysis, only initial conscious level, appropriate antibiotic therapy and septic shock were independently associated with mortality, after adjustment for other potentially confounding factors. Initial empirical antibiotics with both third-generation cephalosporin and penicillin G, should be considered for the majority of meningitis cases resulting from infection with Gram-negative bacilli and streptococcal species. Besides the evolution of newer pathogens, there has been increasing incidence for nosocomially acquired bacterial meningitis for patients postneurosurgery, with the emergence of resistant strains presenting a therapeutic challenge in recent years. Vancomycin and imipenem/cilastatin should be considered as the initial empirical antibiotics of choice for the treatment of this special group of patients.
TI  - Results of the 1997 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program in Three Brazilian  Medical Centers.
AB  - The SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program began in January, 1997, and is designed to monitor nosocomial and selected community acquired infections via a worldwide surveillance network of sentinel hospitals distributed equally by geographic location and size. Three sites in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro, Florianopolis, and Sao Paulo - participated in the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program stet. Rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections, pneumonia, wound or skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections (UTI) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis obtained from outpatients with respiratory tract infections were also evaluated. The isolates for the evaluated infections were: 1) bloodstream - 20 consecutive isolates in each calendar month during a 12-month period; 2) pneumonia - 100 consecutive isolates over a 6 month period; 3) wound or skin and soft tissue - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period; and 4) UTI - 50 consecutive isolates over a 3 month period. Each hospital also contributed, over a 6 month period, consecutive clinically significant outpatient isolates (one isolate per patient) of S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis that were considered pathogens in respiratory tract infections. Data collected for each isolate included species identification, antimicrobial susceptibility profile, date of isolation, and specimen type. Molecular studies were performed on selected isolates. A total of 1,241 bacterial strains were obtained; the majority were cultured from hospitalized patients, while 139 were fastidious organisms from community acquired respiratory tract infections. Gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus were the predominant pathogens, and Enterobacter spp. was a significant pathogen. The predominance of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and the significant levels of resistance to most agents are of major concern, as is the epidemic rate of ESBL-producing strains of Klebsiella spp. and E. coli in Brazil, which is much higher than rates seen in other areas of the world. Resistance among P. aeruginosa and the Enterobacteriaceae to fluoroquinolones, oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin- and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant pneumococci were other significant resistance issues identified in this surveillance study. Vancomycin resistance among the enterococci, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae was not identified. This benchmark study will serve as comparison for future surveillance studies, including the ongoing SENTRY program, to monitor emerging resistance trends in Brazil. The high rates of resistance observed in this study underscore the need for global surveillance and local action.
TI  - Immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator 'Dentavax' in a rabbit experimental model.
AB  - The immunostimulating and protective effects of an oral polybacterial immunomodulator, Dentavax (D), composed of killed cells from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus and their lysates, have been investigated on an experimental rabbit model. In this model, mixed suspensions of the above bacterial wild strains have been injected in six sides of oral mucosa. A long-lasting inflammation with the development of infiltrates and confluating abscesses has been observed. The influence of orally given Dentavax on the course of the model infection as well as on the dynamics of the immune response has been studied. A two-fold decrease in the duration and severity of inflammatory reaction, confirmed by the histological findings, has been registered. In immunised animals, an activation of polymorphonuclear phagocytosis, together with stimulation of humoral systemic and mucosal immunity with synthesis of specific serum (predominantly, IgG) and coproantibodies (predominantly, S-IgA) determined by ELISA, has been found. The results obtained proved the strong immunostimulating and protective effects of the preparation D, which is meant for the prophylaxis and treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the urinary tract and its drug sensitivity in children with vesico-ureteral reflux].
AB  - The authors of the following publication present the results of a research which  has been made on the presence of bacterial flora in children with vesico-ureteral reflux. As a first step, an analysis of the bacterial flora was made. Then, two pathogens occurring most often were selected their drug-sensitivity was tested. The assessment of the bacterial flora and its drug-sensitivity ware based on urine inoculations. Clinical material was provided by 184 children suffering from urinary tract infections, out of whom only those with the vesico-ureteral reflux diagnosed on the basis of miction ureterography, were taken into consideration. In the wake of the analysis made, E. coli, which causes 30% of the infections, and Enterococcus fecalis, causing 14% of the infections, were found out to be the pathogens occurring most often in urine cultures. Other bacteria, listed according to the occurrence rate, are as follows: mixed flora, Streptococcus spp, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae. As regards drug-sensitivity, E. coli & Enterococcus fecalis have been considered to reveal the same high sensitivity to nitrofurantoin and 3-generation cefalosporyn.
TI  - Post-traumatic meningitis: histomorphological findings, postmortem microbiology and forensic implications.
AB  - Infections of the leptomeninges with the infectious agent gaining access to the intracranial compartment by traumatic means are termed post-traumatic. In cases with fatal outcome, the manner of death has to be classified as non-natural. Six cases of post-traumatic meningitis as the cause of death from the archives of the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, Germany with histological and microbiological investigations are presented. There were all males, age varying between 24 and 90 years (mean 58 years); range of the interval between original trauma and beginning of symptoms was 2 days up to 8 years; in 50% of the cases meningeal swabs yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae. Findings concerning origin and mechanism of post-traumatic meningitis as well as microbiological studies are compared with selected cases from the literature.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of piperacillin in several fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - We investigated activity of piperacillin (PIPC) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. The following results were obtained: 1. PIPC had its MIC90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in Gram-positive bacteria (Methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis) and showed its MIC of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible PRSP strains out of 38 isolates of S. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. PIPC showed favorable antibacterial activities as its MIC90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae), except for P. mirabilis in which its MIC90 was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of P. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as PIPC, ABPC, CTM and CZOP. 3. PIPC had its MIC90 of > 128 micrograms/ml in Bacteroides fragilis. From these results, PIPC was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when 20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between April 1997 and March 1998].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 19 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during the period from April 1997 to March 1998. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 215 for one year. A total of 420 strains (170 strains from primary infections and 250 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 174 cases (80.9% of total cases). In primary infections, the isolation rate of anaerobic bacteria was higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, which was frequently isolated from postoperative infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. We found neither vancomycin nor arbekacin resistant strains of S. aureus, and found no vancomycin resistant strains of Enterococcus spp. The susceptibility of P. aeruginosa against carbapenems did not decline in the year 1997, while resistance of B. fragilis group against cephems advanced increasingly.

AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - Antibiotic bacterial resistance in ambulatory patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluates trends in antibiotic resistance in patients who  were treated in an ambulatory setting. METHODS: The authors compiled the data from all lower respiratory track(sputum) cultures collected from ambulatory patients who visited the Olmsted Medical Center and Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1998. Cultured organisms were identified, and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were presented and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines for MIC and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS: 4,297 potentially pathogenic organisms were obtained from sputum cultures for 1,921 patients. The most discernible changes in antibiotic resistance appeared to be in cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A trend toward increasing resistance of isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam drugs was observed in a portion of the population. An emerging intermediate susceptibility among isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudoumonas species was noted. CONCLUSIONS: Trends in antimicrobial resistance of respiratory pathogens from ambulatory patients are less clear than those from hospitalized patients, but must be monitored because of the high percentage of ambulatory patients who receive empirical therapies. Trends in intermediate susceptibility patterns may help reveal emerging antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Predictors of infectious complications after burn injuries in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are the major life-threatening complication of burn injury and occur with the greatest frequency in children. Knowledge of their occurrence and management, however, is extrapolated from studies in adults. We performed a prospective study of infectious complications in burned children. OBJECTIVE: To delineate epidemiology, risk factors and microbiology of infections in burned children where burn care and surgical interventions are optimal. METHODS: Children hospitalized for burns were entered into prospective study. Characteristics of the burn injury were assessed, and active surveillance for infections was performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients were entered [mean age, 42 months; mean total body surface area (TBSA), burn 15%]. Twenty-seven percent of patients developed 39 infections: 13 involved the burn wound (burn wound sepsis, 6; graft loss, 5; and cellulitis, 2); 13 were catheter-associated septicemia; 13 involved other sites (i.e. pneumonia, 4; urinary tract infection, 3; bacteremia, 2; endocarditis, 1; myocardial abscess, 1; toxin-mediated syndrome, 1; and otitis media, 1). Twenty-three infections were caused by a single organism, 9 infections by more than 1 organism and in 7 infections defined by CDC criteria no organism was recovered. Organisms causing infection were: Staphylococcus aureus, 19; Candida albicans, 4; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4; coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 4; Enterococcus sp., 3; Escherichia coli, 1; Klebsiella oxytoca, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1; Aspergillus fumigatus, 1; and Candida parapsilosis, 1. Burn mechanism (flame and inhalation), extent (TBSA >30%) and depth (full thickness) were risk factors for infection; young age and site of burn were not. CONCLUSION: The most common infections occurring in burn children are burn wound infections and catheter-associated septicemia. Characteristics of burn injury predict risk of infection. Children with flame and inhalation injury, TBSA burned >30% and full thickness burns are at high risk of infectious complications.
TI  - [Monitoring bacterial resistance to antibiotics in the CroatianRepublic].
AB  - In 1996 a Committee for antibiotic resistance surveillance in Croatia was founded by the Croatian Academy of Medical Sciences. In this study antibiotic surveillance results for the period June 1-December 31, 1997 from 12 microbiology laboratories throughout Croatia are presented. Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined by disk diffusion method for the following bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In general, high proportion of resistant isolates was recorded throughout Croatia, although some regional variations were noticed. Mean resistance of pneumococci to penicillin was 38%, in S. aureus resistance to methicillin was 47%, and 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistance in E. coli was 6% and in Klebsiella spp. 21%. In P. aeruginosa resistance to gentamicin averaged 50%, to imipenem 13% and to ceftazidim 8%. Future aims of the Committee are to continue routine antibiotic resistance surveillance during certain periods every year, and to estimate clinical significance of resistant bacteria, detect mechanisms of resistance and improve the quality of laboratory work through education and quality control projects.
TI  - Bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The gastrointestinal microflora exerts a barrier effect against enteropathogens. The aim of this study was to examine if bifidobacteria, a major species of the human colonic microflora, participates in the barrier effect by developing antimicrobial activity against enterovirulent bacteria. METHODS: Antibacterial activity was examined in vitro against a wide range of Gram negative and Gram positive pathogens. Inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium SL1334 cell association and cell invasion was investigated in vitro using Caco-2 cells. Colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract in vivo by bifidobacteria was examined in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice. Antimicrobial activity was examined in vivo in axenic C3/He/Oujco mice infected by the lethal S typhimurium C5 strain. RESULTS: Fourteen human bifidobacterium strains isolated from infant stools were examined for antimicrobial activity. Two strains (CA1 and F9) expressed antagonistic activity against pathogens in vitro, inhibited cell entry, and killed intracellular S typhimurium SL1344 in Caco-2 cells. An antibacterial component(s) produced by CA1 and F9 was found to be a lipophilic molecule(s) with a molecular weight of less than 3500. In the axenic C3/He/Oujco mice, CA1 and F9 strains colonised the intestinal tract and protected mice against S typhimurium C5 lethal infection. CONCLUSION: Several bifidobacterium strains from resident infant human gastrointestinal microflora exert antimicrobial activity, suggesting that they could participate in the "barrier effect" produced by the indigenous microflora.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project ICARE laboratories.
AB  - A proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in Project ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology). All laboratories correctly identified the Staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an Enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. Thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the Streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. All laboratories testing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. Of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant MICs or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant Serratia marcescens. For the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime MICs in the resistant range. These results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. This highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.
TI  - The clinical features of severe community-acquired pneumonia presenting as septic shock. Norasept II Study Investigators.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this article was to determine the outcome, clinical and prognostic features, and microbiology of a large group of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) presenting in septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The placebo limb of the Norasept II database was examined. Data were collected on patients in septic shock with a diagnosis of CAP who presented to a participating site from home. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight patients met the study criteria. The 28-day survival was 53%. One hundred and four pathogens were isolated from 77 (52%) patients with 24 (16%) patients having polymicrobial infections. The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Infection with P aeruginosa or Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality (82%). The only clinical variables recorded in the database that could identify patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection was a history of alcohol abuse. Comorbidities were present in 74% of patients, involving predominantly the cardiorespiratory system. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated APACHE II score and serum interleukin 6 (IL-6) concentration to be significant independent predictors of mortality. Patients with pseudomonas or acinetobacter infection had significantly higher IL-6 levels and significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels when compared with the rest of the cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: A diverse spectrum of both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were implicated in patients with CAP presenting in septic shock, necessitating broad spectrum empiric antimicrobial coverage. This coverage should include antipseudomonal activity, particularly in alcoholic patients. Severity of illness (APACHE II score) and IL-6 levels were important prognostic factors. Infection with P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species carried a very high mortality.
TI  - Neonatal meningitis: mortality, cerebrospinal fluid, and microbiological findings.
AB  - This study describes the bacteriology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, and mortality of neonatal meningitis over an 11-year period. The minimum incidence of neonatal meningitis at Tygerberg Hospital is 0.72/1000 live births/year. Eighty-eight patients were included in the study. Median birthweight and age at diagnosis were 2320 g and 12 days, respectively. CSF culture was positive in 77 (88 per cent), blood culture was positive in 51 (57 per cent), and Gram stain was positive in 58 (66 per cent). The most frequently cultured organisms were Group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli. Thirty (34 per cent) patients died, the majority within 72 h after admission. The death rate was significantly increased in babies with a birthweight of less than 1500 g (59 per cent). Increased total CSF protein was associated with an increased risk of death. Normal CSF cell count, total CSF protein and CSF glucose were found in six infants.
TI  - Bacteriology of surgical site infections and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of the isolates at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study post surgical infections and sensitivity of the Isolates so that recommendations can be made for their prevention and empirical antibiotic treatment. SETTING: Swabs/pus specimens from the patients developing surgical site infections at PNS Shifa, Karachi were processed in the Department of Pathology during January, 1998 to September, 1999. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-nine swabs/pus specimens from various types of surgical sites suspected to be infected on clinical grounds were processed, by standard methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing of all the isolates was done by using Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: Of the one hundred and fifty-three organisms isolated, the most common was Staphylococcus aureus (50.32%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.3%), Escherichia coli (14.37%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.76%), miscellaneous gram negative rods (5.88%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (1.30%). About 50% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. In case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli more than 60% of the isolates were found resistant to Gentamicin. The resistance to third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone ciprofloxacin was also quite high. Other isolates also showed a very high level of antibiotic resistance. CONCLUSION: In addition to the economic burden for antibiotic treatment, such infections for multi-resistant organisms are a serious threat to our surgical patients. To prevent these happenings, there is an urgent need to adopt basic principles of asepsis and sterilisation and to make judicious use of prophylactic and therapeutic antibiotics.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence, expression and transcriptional analysis of the Bifidobacterium longum MB 219 lacZ gene.
AB  - The gene encoding beta-galactosidase was isolated by functional complementation of Escherichia coli from Bifidobacterium longum MB219, which exhibited the highest activity among ten Bifidobacterium strains tested of the species B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, B. indicum, B. animalis and B. cuniculi. The nucleotide sequence of the 5.0-kb fragment conferring the positive beta-galactosidase phenotype to E. coli revealed the presence of a lacZ-type gene encoding a 1023-amino-acid protein that was preceded by a ribosome binding site. A sequence showing 72% identity with the proline tRNA of Bacillus subtilis and a gene probably encoding the DNA-3-methyladenine glycosydase I were located downstream from the lacZ gene, after a gap of 30-50 unsequenced base pairs. By primer-extension analysis, the transcription start site of the lacZ gene was mapped 65 nt upstream from the start codon, and it enabled identification of the -10 region of the putative promoter. The nucleotide sequence of lacZ and its deduced amino acid sequence were compared with those of beta-galactosidase genes and enzymes from other microorganisms. High similarity was demonstrated between the B. longum beta-galactosidase and its counterparts in Lactobacillus delbruckii subsp. bulgaricus, Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, E. coli, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Leuconostoc lactis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, all belonging to the LacZ family. The B. longum MB219 lacZ gene was cloned in Bifidobacterium and its expression was observed in strains with otherwise low levels of endogenous activity. The expression increased by factors of 1.5-50 and enabled those strains that do not grow on lactose to use this sugar as sole carbon source.
TI  - Group B streptococcal meningitis in adults: recent increase in Southeast Asia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meningitis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Streptococcus) is rare in adults and usually affects patients with predisposing conditions. AIMS: To describe an increase in adult group B streptococcal meningitis occurring in parallel in Hong Kong and Singapore. METHODS: All cases of bacterial meningitis admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong and Singapore General Hospital in 1998, aged 15 years or above, were reviewed. Medical records for the previous ten years were searched for previous cases of adult group B streptococcal meningitis. RESULTS: In 1998, 29 adult patients with bacterial meningitis were admitted to the two hospitals. S. agalactiae was isolated in 11 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in three cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two cases, and Pseudomonas pseudomallei in one case. In 11 cases no bacteriological diagnosis could be made. Two patients with adult group B streptococcal meningitis had predisposing conditions for infection. One patient died before a definite diagnosis could be established. A ten year review of records revealed one previous case of adult group B streptococcal meningitis in a patient with multiple risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of group B streptococcal meningitis has occurred among adults admitted to two major hospitals in two Southeast Asian cities. In the majority of cases there were no identifiable predisposing conditions. The cause of this increase of group B streptococcal remains unclear.
TI  - Hepatic abscess as a complication of the sump syndrome.
AB  - We report a case of hepatic abscess associated with the sump syndrome. The patient was a 66-year-old woman who had undergone cholecystectomy and side-to-side choledochoduodenostomy for a common bile duct (CBD) stone in 1983, and who presented with fever and right lower chest pain. A hepatic abscess was diagnosed; after it was drained, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage was performed. Bacteriological studies revealed the presence of Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus intermedius in the pus in the hepatic abscess cavity, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bile. The hepatic abscess and cholangitis rapidly resolved in response to two drainage procedures. At surgery, simple closure of the anastomosis was performed, because free drainage was observed from the distal CBD into the duodenum, despite the existence of a periampullary diverticulum.
TI  - Differential host susceptibility to pulmonary infections with bacteria and fungi  in mice deficient in myeloperoxidase.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is located within neutrophils capable of producing hypochlorous acid, is active in vitro against bacteria and fungi. However, MPO-deficient persons are usually healthy. To define the in vivo contribution of MPO to early host defense against pulmonary infections, MPO-deficient and control mice were intranasally infected with various fungi and bacteria, and the number of residual microorganisms in lungs was compared 48 h later. MPO-deficient mice showed severely reduced cytotoxicity to Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Trichosporon asahii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the mutant mice showed a slight but significantly delayed clearance of Aspergillus fumigatus and Klebsiella pneumoniae and had comparable levels of resistance to the wild type against Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results suggest that the MPO-dependent oxidative system is important for host defense against fungi and bacteria, although the effect varies by pathogen species.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 3: Modification of ring-B.
AB  - Ring-B derivatization of totarol (1) afforded the series of compounds 2-22 which  were screened in vitro against: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Several of the derivatives retained much of the antibacterial activity of totatol against the first three of these organisms (all gram-positive), but none was more active. The gram-negative Klebsiella was resistant to all compounds examined. Totarol (1) was shown to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria at 50 microM.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 2: Modifications at C-12 and O-13.
AB  - Alterations of the C-12 and C-13 aromatic ring substituents of totarol (1) afforded the series of derivatives 2-14, and introduction of substituents at C-12 gave exclusively 2a-14a. The majority of these analogues were tested in vitro against the following organisms: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results were evaluated in terms of structure-activity relationship which reveals that: (a) the phenolic moiety at C-13, in general, is essential for antibacterial activity at < 32 microg/mL against gram-positive species, and (b) derivatization at C-12 has an undesirable effect on the antibacterial activity of this class of compounds, while (c) all compounds tested are ineffective against the gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Characteristics of neonatal bacterial meningitis in a teaching hospital in Taiwan from 1984-1997.
AB  - During the period from 1984 to 1997, 85 bacterial meningitis neonates with positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures were treated. The ages of these patients ranged from 1 to 28 days. The male to female ratio was 1.7 to 1. The most common causative agent was group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 31.8%), followed by Escherichia coli (20%), Proteus mirabilis (7.1%), Enterobacter cloacae (5.9%), other streptococci excluding Streptococcus pneumoniae (5.9%), Chryseobacterium meningosepticum (5.9%), enterococci (4.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.5%). Among the 85 patients treated, 51 (60%) were younger than 7 days old. Among them, dyspnea was the most common clinical manifestation. In contrast, fever and diarrhea were seen more frequently in neonates with late onset of disease (after seven days of age). Ampicillin and cefotaxime were the most commonly used antibiotics. The most frequently encountered complications were hydrocephalus and seizures. Since 1991, GBS has overtaken E. coli as the leading cause of neonatal bacterial meningitis. This was accompanied by a fall in the mortality rate, but a sustained high incidence of complications and sequelae. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing strategies to prevent group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1998)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 18 institutions around the entire Japan, 532 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 438 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1998 to September in 1999. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 85 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 96 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 75 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 6 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 38 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 26 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of 517 strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 60.0%. Vancomycin (VCM) and arbekacin (ABK) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. But one of MRSA showed resistance to ABK with the MIC of 64 micrograms/ml. The sensitive strains of MRSA to VCM have decreased. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) + PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) have increased in 46.0% for 1998 comparatively from 30.9% of 1997's. But PRSP decreased, and PISP increased into 39.0% of 1998 years from 19.8% of 1997's. Panipenem (PAPM), imipenem (IPM) and faropenem (FRPM) showed the most potent activities against S. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Against H. influenzae and M. (B.) catarrhalis, almost all the drugs showed good activities. The sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) decreased in 1997, but those have increased in 1998. Inversely, the susceptibility of them against cefotiam (CTM) had been higher in 1997, but those have been lower in 1998. Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and nonmucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. A quite few of K. pneumoniae showed low susceptibilities. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 48.6% of all the patients showing a slight increase in every year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases as follows: Bacterial pneumonia was the most frequent with 40.2%. The ratio of it has increased slightly, and the increased rate was 10% in patients with ages over 70 years compared with the results in 1997. Chronic bronchitis have decreased slightly with 27.6% in 1998. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these were almost same number in bacterial pneumonia. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 26.7%, H. influenzae 23.8%, S. aureus 13.3% and M. (B.) catarrhalis 10.8%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid) was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 45.5% after administration over 15 days. The frequencies of S. pneumoniae decreased upon administration of antibiotics, these were only 4.5% over 15 days. The frequencies of H. (
TI  - Neonatal meningitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalent bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis and their antibiotic susceptibility in a referral intensive care unit in Assir Central Hospital, Saudi Arabia, during the years 1993-1998. METHODS: Records of newborn infants with positive cerebrospinal fluid culture during the period were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: There were 1473 nursery admissions, of which 32 episodes of meningitis occurred amongst 31 neonates. Klebsiella pneumoniae (31%) and Serratia marcescens (21%) were the main pathogens. The incidence of concurrent septicemia among these infants was 58%. Klebsiella pneumoniae appears to dominate in both early and late onset infections. The sex incidence was equal and the mortality rate was 48%. CONCLUSION: The survey identifies Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp. as the leading bacterial agents of neonatal meningitis in our environment. The relatively high frequency of Serratia infection in the present survey appears unique as this organism is comparatively rare in other reports across the globe. No Group B Streptococcus was isolated, which is in contrast to reports obtained in Europe, America and Australia where it is the predominant organism of neonatal sepsis or meningitis. Antibiogram identified imipenem and cefotaxime as the empirical antibiotics in infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal sepsis in our hospital; no more conventional use of ampicillin. In view of the changing bacterial pattern of infant infection with time even in the same environment, a periodic review of this subject is advocated.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potency of the Leaf - Stalk Extract of Curcuma longa (LINN).
AB  - The methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa LINN, was tested for its minimum Inhibitor concentration (MIC) against Gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative E.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Microbiologic features of adult community-acquired bacterial meningitis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Community-acquired bacterial meningitis (CABM) is a life-threatening disease that requires prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine the causative microorganisms of CABM and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a major teaching hospital in Taipei from 1993 to 1998. METHODS: A review of medical records and microbiologic data was used to identify cases of CABM and causative pathogens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Among the 48 adult patients with a diagnosis of CABM during the study period, the causative pathogens were identified in 36 cases. Unlike reports from other countries, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the leading causative pathogen (33%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (28%), Listeria monocytogenes (11%), Neisseria meningitidis (6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6%), streptococci (6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%). The incidence of CABM due to K. pneumoniae increased during the study period (p = 0.012, Poisson regression), while the incidence of CABM due to other pathogens remained stable. All of the CABM-associated K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime but 25% of the CABM-associated S. pneumoniae strains were not susceptible to penicillin G. CONCLUSIONS: Penicillin G alone was not an appropriate empiric therapy for adult CABM because a high percentage of cases were due to K. pneumoniae or penicillin nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae. While the recommendations for the initial empiric regimen for CABM due to S. pneumoniae in Taiwan remain to be developed, third-generation cephalosporins appear to be an appropriate initial empiric regimen for the treatment of CABM due to K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Respiratory tract pathogens isolated from patients hospitalized with suspected pneumonia: frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - Thirty-seven sentinel hospitals (29 in the United States [US]; eight in Canada) collected bacterial isolates from hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of these pathogens were determined to more than 60 agents (40 reported) using the reference broth microdilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The five most frequently recorded species among the 2757 isolates collected during the study were (no. tested/%): Staphylococcus aureus (632/22.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (498/18. 1%), Haemophilus influenzae (284/10.3%), Klebsiella spp. (240/8.7%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (213/7.7%). There was a significant difference in the susceptibility to antimicrobials between the US and Canada for S. aureus to oxacillin (50.1% versus 93.8% susceptible, respectively), gentamicin (78.7% versus 97.8%), and fluoroquinolones (49.5 to 53.0% versus 89.8 to 94.9%). Amikacin (92. 8% susceptible) was the most active antimicrobial agent against P. aeruginosa, and meropenem was the most potent beta-lactam. Against H. influenzae, most drugs retained a high level of activity, whilst against the S. pneumoniae, only the newer fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, sparfloxacin) remained highly effective in vitro. Only two antimicrobial agents (imipenem and meropenem) were >99% active against the Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. isolated in this survey (possess extended spectrum beta-lactamases or hyperproduction of Amp C cephalosporins); cefepime (95.6-100.0% susceptible) was significantly more active than other cephalosporins tested. Clonal, epidemic outbreaks of multiply resistant strains were very rare in monitored hospitals. In conclusion, important differences exist between the US and Canada in the susceptibility patterns of some respiratory tract pathogens to commonly used antimicrobial agents with Canadian strains generally being more susceptible to currently available antimicrobial agents.

AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin against canine bacterial isolates from clinical cases was studied in the United States and The Netherlands. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC), the postantibiotic effect, the effect of pH on antimicrobial activity, and the bacterial killing rate tests were determined according to standard techniques. The MICs of American and Dutch isolates agreed in general. The MICs of the American gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.06 to 2.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of the Dutch gram-negative isolates ranged from 0.016 to 8.0 microg/ml. A few European strains of Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae had relatively high MICs. Bordetella bronchiseptica also was less susceptible to difloxacin. The MICs of the American gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.125 to 4.0 microg/ml, and the MICs of Dutch isolates ranged from 0.125 to 2.0 microg/ ml. Difloxacin induced a concentration-dependent postantibiotic effect that lasted 0.2-3 hours in cultures with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus intermedius, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. There was no postantibiotic effect observed against canine Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Decreasing the pH of the medium increased the MIC of Proteus mirabilis for difloxacin. The MICs of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were lowest at neutral pH and were slightly increased in acid or alkaline media. At a neutral pH, most tested bacterial species were killed at a difloxacin concentration of 4 times the MIC. Similar results were obtained when these same bacteria were tested against enrofloxacin. A Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in an acidic environment was readily killed at difloxacin or enrofloxacin MIC, but at neutral pH the drug concentration had to be raised to 4 times the MIC for a bactericidal effect. After 24 hours of incubation at pH 7.1, difloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar bactericidal activity for all bacteria tested except Staphylococcus intermedius. Against S. intermedius, difloxacin was more bactericidal than enrofloxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin against a broad range of recent clinical isolates from the USA.
AB  - The antibacterial potencies of gemifloxacin (SB-265805) and 13 comparator compounds were determined by broth microdilution against a panel of 645 Gram-positive and 995 Gram-negative organisms collected from various USA sites. Time-kill studies were performed and postantibiotic effect (PAE) was determined for several organisms using trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin as comparator compounds. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent compound tested against Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0. 016 mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (0.03 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.03 mg/L), viridans streptococci (0.12 mg/L), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.03 mg/L), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 mg/L), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (0. 016 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 mg/L). Against Gram-negative isolates, the potency of gemifloxacin was equal to that of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and generally better than that of ofloxacin, grepafloxacin, trovafloxacin and nalidixic acid. MIC(90)s for gemifloxacin were: Haemophilus influenzae (</=0.008 mg/L), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.008 mg/L), Escherichia coli (0.016 mg/L), Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.25 mg/L), Klebsiella oxytoca (0.25 mg/L), Enterobacter cloacae (1 mg/L), Enterobacter aerogenes (0.25 mg/L), Proteus spp. (4 mg/L), Serratia spp. (1 mg/L), Citrobacter freundii (2 mg/L), Morganella morganii (0.12 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 mg/L), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4 mg/L) and Acinetobacter spp. (32 mg/L). Gemifloxacin was bactericidal for all organisms studied at 2 and 4 x MIC. The PAE for most strains was in the range 0.7-2.5 h at 2 and 4 x MIC, although longer PAEs were observed with H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris (>6 h at 4 x MIC) and shorter PAEs with E. faecalis (0.1-0.6 h) and K. pneumoniae (0.1-0.2 h). In conclusion, gemifloxacin is a novel quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. It has substantially improved potency against Gram-positive organisms, especially streptococci, for which gemifloxacin is generally at least eight- to 16-fold more potent than other quinolones tested. It retains the good Gram-negative activity seen with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and shows good bactericidal activity and prolonged PAEs.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of gatifloxacin against 873 clinical isolates from respiratory tract, urinary tract and surgical infections during 1997-1998 in Japan.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gatifloxacin was determined for 873 isolates from various infections during 1997-1998 in Japan. Gatifloxacin was active against streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with MIC(90)s of </=0.39 mg/L. The activity was two- to 32-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against Gram-positive bacteria, and comparable to that against Gram-negative bacteria. Gatifloxacin was more active than the other quinolones against quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. It also had good activity against penicillin- or macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Effects of subinhibitory concentrations of moxifloxacin in an in-vitro dynamic model.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE), sub-MIC effect (SME) and postantibiotic sub-MIC  effect (PASME) of moxifloxacin were investigated in an in-vitro dynamic model reproducing in-vivo elimination kinetics of the antibiotic. The PAE was induced by exposing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae to 5 x MIC of the antibiotic for 1.5 hours. After induction, cultures were washed to eliminate the antibiotic and resuspended into the dynamic model either in the presence or absence of a subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent of 0.5 x MIC. Unexposed controls were treated similarly. PASMEs were constantly longer than corresponding SMEs, but differences between them were not statistically significant. Both PASMEs (mean 11:17 hours, range from 8:17 to 14:57) and SMEs (mean 9:23 hours, range from 6:03 to 12:34) had an initial bactericidal effect and were significantly longer than PAEs (mean 1:31 hours, range from 0:21 to 2:14). The primary effect of moxifloxacin sub-MICs appears to be prevalent in PAE. The possibility of once-daily dosing of the drug is strengthened.
TI  - Multilocus enzyme analysis in aerobic and anaerobic bacteria using gel electrophoresis-nitrocellulose blotting.
AB  - An optimized multilocus enzyme electrophoresis method, which involves polyacrylamide-agarose gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfers on nitrocellulose sheets, was developed for the analysis of enzyme polymorphism in several aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and K. oxytoca, Clostridium bifermentans and C. sordellii, and Prevotella bivia. Serial electrophoretic transfers (during 5-15 min each) from a single polyacrylamide gel could be achieved for most enzymes studied, and allowed an increased definition of enzyme bands on nitrocellulose as compared to migration gels. Four enzymes, which could not be blotted in such conditions, could still be stained in gels after blotting. Thus, the method allowed the combined analysis of several enzymes after a single gel electrophoresis separation. The analysis of enzyme polymorphism in the various species studied raised the interest of polymorphic loci such as esterase or glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase for epidemiologic studies. The method characterized a genetic diversity of enzyme loci of S. pneumoniae higher than previously reported, and is thus convenient for the analysis of genetic relationships between related isolates. Since the present method reduces the tediousness of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and requires experimental conditions that are not specific for the bacterial population studied, it may be proposed for rapid population genetics analysis of a wide variety of bacteria.
TI  - In vivo pharmacodynamic activities of two glycylcyclines (GAR-936 and WAY 152,288) against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in vivo pharmacodynamic activities of two glycylcyclines (GAR-936 and WAY 152,288) were assessed in an experimental murine thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Mice were infected with one of several strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most infections were treated with a twice-daily dosing schedule, with administration of 0.75 to 192 mg of GAR-936 or WAY 152,288 per kg of body weight. A maximum-effect dose-response model was used to calculate the dose that produced a net bacteriostatic effect over 24 h of therapy. This dose was called the bacteriostatic dose. More extensive dosing studies were performed with S. pneumoniae 1199, E. coli ATCC 25922, and K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816, with doses being given as one, two, four, or eight equal doses over a period of 24 h. The dosing schedules were designed in order to minimize the interrelationship between the various pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters studied. These parameters were time above 0.03 to 32 times the MIC, area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), and maximum concentration of drug in serum (C(max)). The bacteriostatic dose remained essentially the same, irrespective of the dosing frequency, for S. pneumoniae 1199 (0.3 to 0.9 mg/kg/day). For E. coli ATCC 25922 and K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816, however, more frequent dosing led to lower bacteriostatic doses. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated dose-dependent elimination half-lives of 1.05 to 2.34 and 1.65 to 3.36 h and serum protein bindings of 59 and 71% for GAR-936 and WAY 152,288, respectively. GAR-936 and WAY 152,288 were similarly effective against the microorganisms studied, with small differences in maximum effect and 50% effective dose. The glycylcyclines were also similarly effective against tetracycline-sensitive and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. Time above a certain factor (range, 0.5 to 4 times) of the MIC was a better predictor of in vivo efficacy than C(max) or AUC for most organism-drug combinations. The results demonstrate that in order to achieve 80% maximum efficacy, the concentration of unbound drug in serum should be maintained above the MIC for at least 50% of the time for GAR-936 and for at least 75% of the time for WAY 152,288. The results of these experiments will aid in the rational design of dose-finding studies for these glycylcyclines in humans.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in Europe from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  - As part of the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 25  European university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all referrals, with minor regional variation. Of these, approximately 0.36% of E. coli and 16.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. Quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with Enterococcus faecium. However, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower in these facilities.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens: assessing resistance patterns in Europe and the potential  role of grepafloxacin as treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms.
AB  - Although most respiratory tract infections (RTI) are caused by viruses, various bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, are common causes of community-acquired pneumonia, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, otitis media and sinusitis. Empirical antibiotic therapy of patients with RTI must take account of the increasing prevalence of resistance among the predominant pathogens. Europe-wide susceptibility surveillance studies have revealed that resistance to penicillin and macrolides is highly prevalent among isolates of S. pneumoniae from France and Spain. Uniquely, in Italy, macrolide resistance is highly prevalent while the prevalence of penicillin resistance is low. Resistance to other antibiotic classes, including chloramphenicol, doxycycline and, in particular, co-trimoxazole, is associated with penicillin resistance in pneumococci, but resistance to the fluoroquinolones is rare. beta-Lactamase production is the principal mechanism of resistance in isolates of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, with fluoroquinolone resistance being detected rarely in these pathogens. In 1998 a surveillance study involving 15 European countries determined the susceptibilities of many respiratory pathogens to a range of antimicrobials, including grepafloxacin. The MIC(90) of grepafloxacin for 1251 isolates of S. pneumoniae was 0.25 mg/L, the MICs for only five strains being >2 mg/L, and 99.4% of all of the isolates tested were inhibited by concentrations </=0.5 mg/L. The MIC(90)s of grepafloxacin for 587 isolates of H. influenzae and 323 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae were 0.015 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, while that for 509 isolates of M. catarrhalis was 0.03 mg/L. The MIC(90)s for 1164 isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and 435 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Other studies have shown grepafloxacin to be highly active against clinical isolates of Legionella pneumophila (MIC(90) 0.015 mg/L), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (MICs 0.06-0.12 mg/L). Current susceptibility data indicate that fluoroquinolone resistance rates among bacterial respiratory tract pathogens are low in European countries. The enhanced potency and activity of grepafloxacin against isolates of S. pneumoniae, including those exhibiting resistance to unrelated classes of antibiotics, together with its activity against other respiratory tract pathogens, suggest that this drug has considerable potential as empirical therapy of patients with a wide range of RTI.
TI  - Therapeutic efficacy of J-111,225, a novel trans-3,5-disubstituted pyrrolidinylthio-1beta-methylcarbapenem, against experimental murine systemic infections.
AB  - In a murine model of systemic infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), J-111,225 showed an ED(50) value of 5. 83 mg/kg, which was comparable to vancomycin (ED(50) 4.84 mg/kg), whereas imipenem failed to cure infected mice (ED(50) >100 mg/kg). Against a mixed infection caused by MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, monotherapy with J-111,225 showed an ED(50) value of 7.23 mg/kg, whereas combined treatment with vancomycin plus imipenem (1:1) had an ED(50) of 20.86 mg/kg. J-111,225 showed good therapeutic efficacy against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. The unusually broad spectrum suggests that monotherapy with this novel carbapenem may be suitable for polymicrobial infections associated with MRSA.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in a community hospital--comparison of elderly and non-elderly patients].
AB  - A comparative study of 890 patients with community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in a community hospital was performed. The patients were divided into an elderly patient group and a non-elderly patient group. The elderly patients with community-acquired pneumonia exhibited frequent atypical symptoms such as dyspnea, consciousness disturbance and complication of shock, and also were frequently in a poor nutritional condition. The causative microorganism was isolated in 40.8% of the elderly patients and in 44.0% of the non-elderly patients. Polymicrobial agents were detected frequently in the elderly patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae (19.4%), MSSA (16.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.1%) and Haemophilus influenzae (15.0%) were frequently isolated from the sputum of the elderly patients, while Mycoplasma pneumoniae (25.2%), H. influenzae (15.0%), S. pneumoniae (12.2%) and MSSA (10.2%) were frequently isolated from that of the non-elderly patients. Regarding treatment with antibiotics, therapy with a single antibiotic therapy, such as cephem or carbapenem was carried out for the elderly patients, while new quinolone or tetracycline was administered to the non-elderly patients. Although the treatment with antibiotics was adequate according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society, the prognosis was poor; i.e.) in the elderly patients an efficacy rate of 74.3% and a mortality rate of 9.5%. In the non-elderly patients, the prognosis was good; i.e.) an efficacy rate of 88.0% and a mortality rate of 1.7%. These results suggest that the most important factors affecting the prognosis were the general condition of elderly patients and delay in an adequate diagnosis and treatment because of atypical clinical findings.
TI  - [In vitro activity of biapenem (BIPM) against clinically isolated respiratory pathogens in 1996-1998].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of biapenem (BIPM), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was compared with those of imipenem (IPM), panipenem (PAPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and piperacillin (PIPC) against 280 isolates of 9 respiratory pathogens. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae were 0.12, 32, 0.25, 0.06, 4 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. In comparison with other antibiotics, the activity of biapenem (BIPM) for P. aeruginosa was as potent as meropenem (MEPM), but for H. influenzae it was slightly less than those of other antibiotics, and for other respiratory pathogens it was as potent as those of other antibiotics. The MIC90s of biapenem (BIPM) for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens were 0.06, 1, 1, 0.5 microgram/ml, respectively, and which were equal to or somewhat lower than those of other antibiotics. Biapenem (BIPM) showed strong activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, especially P. aeruginosa in general. Based on these results, biapenem (BIPM) is seemed to be highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections with several organism.
TI  - Pyogenic psoas abscess: analysis of 27 cases.
AB  - From 1993 to 1998, 29 pyogenic psoas abscesses occurring in 27 patients were seen in Taichung Veterans General Hospital. Their age range was 25 to 85 years. Diabetes mellitus was the leading underlying disease. Fever and pain in the flank area, back and hip were the usual manifestations. The duration of symptoms prior to the diagnosis ranged from 3 days to 6 months. Most abscesses were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) images and proven by abscess cultures, which were divided into primary and secondary types. Eighteen of 29 abscesses were regarded as primary. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common pathogen in the primary abscesses, followed by Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, viridans streptococci, S. epidermidis, and Salmonella spp.. In the secondary abscess category, E. coli was the leading organism in this series, followed by S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridans streptococci and Candida albicans. The associated conditions included epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, perirenal abscess, pulmonary tuberculosis, empyema, hydronephrosis and trauma history. The initial empiric therapy comprised mostly of cefazolin or oxacillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage, while six received surgical debridement, including two with a recurrent abscess. One patient had both drainage and debridement. Others received medical treatment only. Two of the patients with primary abscess died in spite of percutaneous drainage. Therefore, open drainage, besides appropriate antibiotic treatment, is still required to control complex abscesses with sepsis.
TI  - An additional dose of cefazolin for intraoperative prophylaxis.
AB  - We examined the pancreatic tissue concentrations of cefazolin in ten patients undergoing pancreatectomy, and determined the optimal intraoperative time to deliver a repeat dose of cefazolin. An intravenous bolus dose of 1 g cefazolin was administered at the time of skin incision. Peripheral blood, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and peritoneal samples were obtained intraoperatively every hour for 4 h after the antibiotic was first administered, and pancreatic tissue samples were obtained at the time of pancreatectomy. To determine adequate tissue levels of cefazolin, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were measured for four bacterial species, namely 360 isolates of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), 204 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 314 isolates of Escherichia coli, and 30 isolates of Streptococcus spp. The antibiotic concentrations in adipose tissue and peritoneum 3 h after the administration of cefazolin were lower than the MIC80 for K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and Streptococcus spp. Most pancreatic tissue samples showed antibiotic concentrations greater than the MIC80 for these bacterial species; however, those from four patients complicated by severe chronic pancreatitis, massive intraoperative bleeding, or obesity showed concentrations lower than the MIC80. Thus, we recommend that a second dose of cefazolin be given 3 h after the first administration to maintain adequate levels of antibiotic activity.
TI  - Mannose-binding lectin binds to a range of clinically relevant microorganisms and promotes complement deposition.
AB  - Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a collagenous serum lectin believed to be of importance in innate immunity. Genetically determined low levels of the protein are known to predispose to infections. In this study the binding of purified MBL to pathogens isolated from immunocompromised children was investigated by flow cytometry. Diverse Candida species, Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic group A streptococci exhibited strong binding of MBL, whereas Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Haemophilus influenzae type b were characterized by heterogeneous binding patterns. In contrast, beta-hemolytic group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus epidermidis showed low levels of binding. Bound MBL was able to promote C4 deposition in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that MBL may be of importance in first-line immune defense against several important pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological spectrum of septicemia and peritonitis in nephrotic children.
AB  - From April 1993 to December 1997, 452 admissions of 231 children with nephrotic syndrome to Chang Gung Children's Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. There were 10 episodes of sepsis and 8 episodes of peritonitis in 18 children, and 14 microorganisms were cultured. Two children died due to Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis. Gram-positive microorganisms (n=7) and Gram-negative microorganisms (n=7) were found in equal numbers. Enterococcus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4), group D streptococcus (1), and Streptococcus viridans (1) were the Gram-positive microorganisms cultured. Two of 4 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis were penicillin resistant. Gram-negative microorganisms included Enterobacter cloacae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Escherichia coli (2), Acinetobacter baumannii (1), Neisseria meningitidis (1), and group B salmonella (1). The last three microorganisms have not been previously associated with nephrotic children. Vancomycin therapy to cover penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and a third-generation cephalosporin therapy to cover rare Gram-negative microorganisms should be considered in serious infections of nephrotic children.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in hematological and oncological children with neutropenic fever: two-year study in a medical center.
AB  - A retrospective study of bacteremia in children with neutropenic fever admitted to a medical center in Taiwan from Jan. 1994 to Dec. 1995 was performed. There were in total 273 episodes of neutropenic fever during this period, but only 79 pathogens were isolated from blood specimens in 70 episodes. Klebsiella pneumoniae (27.8%), E. coli (10.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.1%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.6%) were the most common pathogens. All the isolates of S. aureus were methicillin sensitive. About half of K. pneumoniae (10/22) was multiple-drug resistant. There were seven infection-related mortality cases, three due to multiple-drug resistant K. pneumoniae, one due to S. aureus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and two fungemia (Cryptococcus neoformans and Fusarium sp.). Vancomycin is not necessary in initial empiric therapy of neutropenic fever, while cefazolin or oxacillin may be included in cases with central venous access device. Antibiotics to cover intestinal flora, especially K. pneumoniae, are paramount in our hospital.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of novel 2-substituted quinazoline antibacterial agents.
AB  - High-throughput screening of in-house compound libraries led to the discovery of  a novel antibacterial agent, compound 1 (MIC: 12-25 microM against S. pyogenes). In an effort to improve the activity of this active compound, a series of 2-substituted quinazolines was synthesized and evaluated in several antibacterial assays. One such compound (22) displayed improved broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against a variety of bacterial strains. This molecule also inhibited transcription/translation of bacterial RNA, suggesting a mechanism for its antibiotic effects. Structure-activity relationship studies of 22 led to the synthesis of another 24 compounds. Although some of these molecules were found to be active in bacterial growth assays, none were as potent as 22. Compound 22 was tested for its ability to cure a systemic K. pneumonia infection in the mouse and displayed moderate effects compared with a control antibiotic, gentamycin.
TI  - [Monitoring antibiotic resistance in Argentina. The WHONET program, 1995-1996].
AB  - The World Health Organization has implemented a surveillance program for antimicrobial resistance that is known as WHONET. In Argentina the program was developed through a network of 23 public and private hospitals that participate in national and international quality-control programs. Between January 1995 and December 1996, the antimicrobial susceptibility of 16,073 consecutive clinical isolates was determined, using the recommended standards of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards of the United States of America. More than half of the Escherichia coli urinary isolates were resistant to ampicillin and more than 30% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT). When the percentage of resistant isolates from outpatients (OPs) was compared to that observed in hospitalized patients (HPs), a marked difference in antimicrobial activity was noted in the case of gentamicin (2% from OPs resistant vs. 8% from HPs resistant), norfloxacin (2% vs. 6%), and third-generation cephalosporins (7% vs. 15%). Of the Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from blood cultures, 71% and 60% showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and to gentamicin, respectively. The overall rate of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus was 39%. Around half of the Enterococcus spp. isolates showed high resistance to aminoglycosides, but resistance to glycopeptides was not found. In Argentina, ampicillin and SXT were not suitable for treating diarrhea. Shigella flexneri had a higher number of isolates resistant to both of those drugs (87% and 74%, respectively) than Sh. sonnei did (47% and 71%, respectively). About 40% of the Salmonella spp. isolated in pediatric hospitals were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins. When microorganisms causing bacterial meningitis were examined, Streptococcus pneumoniae showed a resistance rate of 18% to penicillin and Haemophilus influenzae a resistance rate of 19% to ampicillin. These rates are within the intermediate range reported for other countries of the Americas and for Europe.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are products of rational drug design, which may exhibit both antimicrobial and antitumor properties. The aim of this study was to investigate both the antimicrobial effects of the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl) and the effects of these cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium in vitro. Furthermore, a relevant solvent for the possible pharmaceutical application of the products was sought concurrently. The antimicrobial effect of the cyclic dipeptides was assayed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion assay against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum. The effect of the cyclic dipeptides on the gastrointestinal epithelium was assessed by changes in alkaline phosphatase expression of HT-29 cells. Cyclo(Pro-Trp) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) show broad spectrum antibacterial properties and cyclo(Trp-Pro) and cyclo(Trp-Trp) show broad spectrum antifungal properties. The maturation of the gastrointestinal cells was enhanced by cyclo(Phe-Pro), cyclo(Tyr-Pro), cyclo(Trp-Trp) and cyclo(Trp-Pro). The activity of these cyclic dipeptides thus indicates potential application of these compounds as pharmacological agents.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of pneumonia in the elderly in a community hospital--comparison of community-acquired pneumonia and nosocomial pneumonia].
AB  - We experienced 530 elderly cases with pneumonia among 930 patients with pneumonia in Kawasaki Medical School Kawasaki Hospital between April 1986 and September 1998. Clinical analysis of all these patients and a comparison of one group consisting of 418 patients with community-acquired pneumonia and another group composed of 112 patients with nosocomial pneumonia were performed. In all of the elderly patients with pneumonia, respiratory symptoms and inflammatory findings were less frequent, but were frequent for those in poor general and nutritional condition. The causative microorganism was isolated in 42% of these patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae, MSSA and Klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently isolated from the sputum of the patients with community-acquired pneumonia, while Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) were frequently isolated from that of nosocomial pneumonia patients. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae and some viruses were less frequent for patients in both groups. Although many intravenous antibiotics, such as cephem or carbapenem were administered to patients in both groups, the prognosis was relatively good for those with community acquired pneumonia but was extremely poor for those with nosocomial pneumonia despite mechanical ventilation or steroid pulse therapy for many patients.
TI  - The synthesis and antibacterial activity of totarol derivatives. Part 1: modifications of ring-C and pro-drugs.
AB  - A series of analogues of, and potential pro-drugs derived from, the potent antibacterial diterpene totarol (1) were synthesized in order to elucidate the minimum structural requirements for antibacterial activity and to seek compounds with good bioavailability in vivo. These analogues varied in the structural features of their aromatic rings and the prodrugs were O-glycosylated derivatives. They were tested in vitro against three gram-positive bacteria: beta-lactamase-positive and high level gentamycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); and against the gram-negative multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. None of the analogues was more potent than totarol itself, which is effective against these gram-positive bacteria at MIC values of 7 microM. The results were evaluated in terms of a structure-activity relationship and this showed that a phenolic moiety was essential for potent antibacterial activity. Amongst the pro-drugs, totaryl alpha-D-mannopyranoside (22) proved the most active in vitro (MIC 18 microM). The in vivo antibacterial activities of compounds 1, 22 and totarol beta-lactoside (23) were assessed in a mouse model of infection, but they were found to be ineffective. Compounds 1 and 22 were shown to be cytotoxic towards proliferating human cell cultures, CH 2983, HeLa, and MG 63, but only at concentrations of > 30 microM.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK041, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK041, a new orally active cephem antibiotic, against a  wide variety of clinical isolates of bacteria was investigated and compared with those of cefdinir (CFDN) and cefditoren (CDTR). FK041 exhibited broad spectrum activity against reference strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK041 was active against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms except Enterococcus faecalis with MIC90s less than 1.56 microg/ml. FK041 was more active than CFDN and CDTR against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus agalactiae and was comparable to CFDN and CDTR against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. FK041 had no activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, like CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed moderate activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae with an MIC range of 0.05 approximately 3.13 microg/ml, and was superior to CFDN but inferior to CDTR. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, FK041 had good activity comparable or superior to those of CFDN and CDTR. However, it was inferior to CDTR in activity against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Morganella morganii, and Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With FK041 a small difference between MIC and MBC against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae was found, indicating that its action is bactericidal against these species. FK041 was stable to group 2beta-lactamase hydrolysis but was unstable to group 1beta-lactamase hydrolysis. The stability of FK041 to these enzymes was similar to those of CFDN and CDTR. FK041 showed high affinity for the main penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of S. aureus (PBP 3, 2, and 1) and E. coli (PBP 3, 4, lbs, 2, and 1a).
TI  - [A South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris) with peritonitis].
AB  - A 6-year-old male tapir was admitted because it had been anorexic for 1 day. On admission, the tapir weighed 160 kg. Its rectal temperature was 32.4 degrees C, its heart rate was 120 beats per minute, and its respiratory rate was 12 breaths per minute. The elasticity of the skin was diminished. Haematological evaluation upon admission revealed a haematocrit of 0.63 L.L-1., 6.0 G.L-1 leucocytes with 40 per cent band neutrophils. The concentrations of urea nitrogen and creatinine in plasma were raised (18.9 mmol L-1. and 475 mumol L-1., respectively). Severe combined acidosis was apparent; the venous pH was 6.965, the bicarbonate concentration was 13.7 mmol.L-1., and the venous pCO2 was 8.6 kPa. No strongyle eggs were isolated from faeces by flotation, but a faecal sample yielded a positive culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and the presence of leucocytes and renal epithelial cells. Treatment with fluids, TMP/S (17.5 and 3.5 mg/kg body weight, twice a day, respectively), and clenbuterol (0.56 microgram/kg body weight, twice a day) intravenously was unsuccessful and the tapir died 4 days after hospitalization. At necropsy, peritonitis due to a colon infarct as well as chronic bronchopneumonia and renal tubulonecrosis were found. The antibiotic susceptibility of the bacteria isolated (Streptoc. sp., E. coli, and K. pneumoniae) from the tapir post-mortem was assessed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefetamet against clinically isolated strains from community acquired respiratory tract infections. Part III].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (CEMT) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were investigated in comparison with those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics during the period from January to March, 1998. The results are summarized as follows; 1. CEMT showed strong antimicrobial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, antimicrobial activities of CEMT against penicillins (PCs)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCs-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were slightly weaker than those of some of the reference antibiotics. 2. No chronological changes of CEMT-MIC level were observed in the antimicrobial activities against S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis or Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. In contrast to this, due to the increase of PISP and PRSP strains, resistance to CEMT appears increasing with time.
TI  - [Septic polyarthritis: treatment complications and results].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rare polyarticular clinical presentation of peripheric septic arthritis has worst prognosis than monoarticular one. We studied 10 patients with polyarticular septic arthritis treated during the last 8 years, to evaluate functional result and complications after surgical treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 5 men and 5 women, with an average age of 46.5 years (range 18-75 years), they presented septic arthritis in two or more joints. We discuss aetiology, clinical presentation and treatment. RESULTS: Treatment was surgical debridement and parenteral antibiotic therapy. Functional result was poor in 54% of the joints treated, 50% of patients presented septic shock and three died.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal activities of new oral penem, faropenem against the various clinical isolates].
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of faropenem (FRPM) more compared with those of various oral beta-lactams against 15 isolates each of 6 species of microorganism. FRPM possessed potent in vitro antibacterial activity against both aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria tested. FRPM showed the same activity as new oral cephems such as cefdinir, cefditoren and cefcapene against all Gram-negative bacteria, but K. pneumoniae strains were less susceptible. The MBC of FRPM against S. pneumoniae and the other strains tested equal and were within 1 dilution the MIC of that, respectively. These results suggest that FRPM has excellent in vitro bactericidal activity against clinical isolates and is a clinically useful for the chemotherapy of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between July 1996 and June 1997].
AB  - The annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in Japan since July 1982. This paper describes the results obtained during period from July 1996 to June 1997. The number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. A total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). From primary infections 162 strains were isolated, and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. From primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was the highest. In postoperative infections, the majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were Enterococcus avium. The isolation rate of Staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of Enterococcus spp. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like B. fragilis group and of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. We found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither Staphylacoccus aureus nor Enterococcus spp.; however, the MIC of arbekacin for one of strains of S. aureus was 100 micrograms/ml. Both the MIC90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against P. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. Compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1997)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and analyzed some characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In these 17 institutions around the entire Japan, 512 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 440 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October in 1997 to September in 1998. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 100 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 81 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 85 strains of Haemophilus influenzae. 71 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 27 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 33 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus: MRSA) accounted for 55.0%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 67.3%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the most potent activities against MRSA. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml against S. pneumoniae. The frequency of penicillin (PC)-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP)+PC-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) had decreased gradually, that is, in 1995 the frequency of it was 40.3%, but that was 30.9% in 1997. Against H. influenzae and M.(B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities. But the sensitive strains of them against ceftazidime (CAZ) had decreased in 1997, compared those in 1995 and 1996. Meropenem (MEPM), IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). And TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were more active against K. pneumoniae in 1997 than that in 1996. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 70 years was 45.5% of all the patients showing a slight increase year by year. About the proportion of diagnosed diseases, not so particular changes were recognized as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 33.6% and 29.1%, respectively. Number of strains isolated from patients before administration of antibiotics were more than those after administration of them in chronic bronchitis, but these had reversed in bacterial pneumonia. The tendency in bacterial pneumonia had been acknowledged since 1995. The increase of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (both mucoid and non-mucoid strains) isolated after administration of antibiotics, has suggested the decrease of the susceptibility of these strains against antibiotics. Administration of antibiotics has changed the results of the frequency of isolation of bacterial species. Bacterial isolations before administration of antibiotics were as follows: S. pneumoniae 24.5%, H. influenzae 21.4%, S. aureus 18.4% and P. aeruginosa 12.2%. The frequencies of S. aureus decreased after antibiotics administration over 15 days, but the frequencies of P. aeruginosa was not affected. The frequencies of P. aeruginosa was 47.8% after administration over 15 days. From patients administered antibiotics of penicillins and cephems. S. aureus was mainly detected with 31.7-58.3%, and from patients administere
TI  - AIDS-associated cryptococcal meningitis in Rwanda (1983-1992): epidemiologic and  diagnostic features.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to document the trend of AIDS-associated Cryptococcus neoformans meningitis (CM) in Kigali, Rwanda, during 1983-1992, and to highlight some diagnostic and epidemiological features of the disease. METHODS: during the study period, 3476 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 2824 adults (1578 men, 1246 women) were analysed in the Laboratory of Microbiology at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Rwanda, Central Africa, using direct examination, culture and detection of the cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in the CSF. RESULTS: CM was diagnosed among 549 (19%) patients (347 men, 202 women) and was by far the leading cause of meningitis before Neisseria meningitidis (n=115), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=68), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (n=26). E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-typhoid Salmonella (n=l5) and streptococci (n=4). The number of CM increased from one case in 1983 to 130 new cases in 1992. All 293 tested CM patients had HIV-1 antibodies. The male/female ratio declined from 3.31 during 1983-1987 to 1.58 during 1988-1992. CM showed a seasonal fluctuation, the highest number of infections being observed during the long rainy season. The sensitivity and specificity of the latex test for diagnosing CM was 98% and 99%, respectively. Cryptococcus neoformans var. gattii was cultured from eight (1.6%) of the 499 culture positive patients. CONCLUSION: CM is an important opportunistic infection among AIDS patients in Central Africa. It remains a problematic diagnosis in areas with limited diagnostic facilities.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Cure of implantable venous port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients without catheter removal.
AB  - The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of port-associated bloodstream infection without device removal has not been systematically studied. We analyzed the outcome of 43 consecutive port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients. Etiologies included Staphylococcus epidermidis (30) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Antibiotics were given through the port for a median of 11 days. Four ports were removed within 72 hours. In 36 (92%) of the remaining 39 episodes, there was a response to antibiotic therapy (defervescence and negative blood culture). In 78% of episodes in which there was a response (excluding two in which the catheters were removed because of mechanical problems), the infections were cured without port removal. Two of the four relapses were cured with a second course of antibiotics. The cure rate was 92% for S. epidermidis infections and 67% for S. aureus infections. Thus, the majority of port-associated bloodstream infections in pediatric hematology-oncology patients can be cured without device removal.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K.
AB  - From Byrsonima crassifolia (L.) H.B.K. a tropical tree widely distributed in Mexico, Central and South America, which has been used medicinally since prehispanic times, we report here the antibacterial activities of organic extracts of roots and stems. The ethyl acetate of roots was the most active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epididermis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Micrococcus luteus.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of central airways after stenting.
AB  - Airway stenting (AS) is increasingly used in the management of obstructive lesions of the central airways. Although retention of secretions and infection have been reported as complications of AS, the microbiological consequences of AS have not yet been evaluated. In this study, we prospectively performed protected specimen brush (PSB) sampling of the airways, before and 3 to 4 wk after AS, in 14 consecutive patients (65 +/- 17 yr), suffering from bronchial (5), extensive esophageal (2), thyroid (1), and adenocystic (1) carcinoma, stenotic tracheal burn lesions (2), postintubation stenosis (2), and Wegener's granulomatosis (1). A cutoff value of >/= 10(2) colony-forming units (cfu). ml(-)(1) was considered diagnostic for airway colonization (AC). PSB results were related to the presence and degree of secretion retention (SR) at the level of the stent. In five of the 14 patients, AC was present prior to AS; in three of these, potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) were identified. After AS, AC was found in 11 (including seven patients without prior AC) of the 14 patients. In six of these patients, one or more PPM were present (Pseudomonas aeruginosa [4], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus pneumoniae [1], Klebsiella spp. [1]). Although AC tended to be associated with the presence of SR (PSB >/= 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in 10 of 12 SR-positive and in zero SR-negative cases; PSB < 10(2) cfu. ml(-)(1) in two SR-positive and in two SR-negative cases), statistical significance was not reached (Fisher exact test, p = 0.06). We conclude that AS is frequently followed by AC, the majority of which occurs in patients without AC prior to AS, and is caused by PPM. In no case, however, AC was associated with clinical signs of infection. AC tended to be associated with SR in the stent.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of LJC 11,036, an active metabolite of L-084, a new oral carbapenem antibiotic with potent antipneumococcal activity.
AB  - LJC 11,036 is the active metabolite of L-084, a novel oral carbapenem that exhibits potent broad-spectrum activity. Antibacterial activities of LJC 11,036 against clinical isolates from respiratory infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 19), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 50), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 53), and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 53), and from urinary-tract infections, such as Escherichia coli (n = 53) (MICs at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.1, </=0.006, 0.39, 0.05, 0.05, and 0.05 microg/ml, respectively), were 2- to 64-fold higher than those of imipenem, cefdinir, and faropenem. Moreover, against these bacterial species, except for H. influenzae, the MIC(90)s of LJC 11,036 were 4- to 512-fold lower than those of levofloxacin. LJC 11,036 showed bactericidal activity equal or superior to that of imipenem. Bactericidal activity against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) did not vary with the phase of growth. LJC 11,036 had potent activity against various beta-lactamase-producing strains, excluding carbapenemase producers. Against renal dehydropeptidase-I, LJC 11,036 was more stable than imipenem. Furthermore, LJC 11,036 produced in vitro postantibiotic sub-MIC effects against PRSP HSC-3 (6.0 h at one-fourth the MIC) and H. influenzae LJ5 (9.2 h at one-half the MIC). LJC 11,036 showed high binding affinities for PBP1A, -1B, -2A/2X, -2B, and -3 of PRSP and for PBP1B, -2, -3A, and -3B of H. influenzae.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A silver chloride-coated nylon wound dressing (Ag-WD) was evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity against five common equine wound pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Bacterial susceptibility study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Equine wound pathogens: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus, and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: An inoculum of each pathogen was incubated directly with Ag-WD and quantitated after 24 to 48 hours of incubation. To determine if bactericidal activity of Ag-WD was contact dependent, an inoculum of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus was incubated separately from Ag-WD by a filter and quantitated after 18 hours of incubation. Inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) determined the silver concentration of Mueller-Hinton broth containing Ag-WD after 24 hours of incubation. To establish if the rate of bacterial killing by Ag-WD differed from a constant silver concentration, pathogens were exposed to a silver concentration of 6.45 microg/mL and quantitated after 18 hours. RESULTS: Direct exposure to Ag-WD significantly reduced bacterial numbers after 15 minutes for K. pneumoniae, 30 minutes for E. coli, 1 hour for P. aeruginosa, and 2 hours for S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus and Staphylococcus aureus. Indirect exposure to Ag-WD resulted in > or =99.9% and > or =90% kill of the inoculum doses of E. coli at 2 hours and Staphylococcus aureus at 18 hours, respectively. Incubation of the pathogens at the constant silver concentration resulted in bacterial killing rates similar to those obtained by incubation with Ag-WD. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro, equine pathogens are effectively killed when exposed to Ag-WD, and the rate of bacterial killing by Ag-WD is similar to a constant silver concentration of 6.45 microg/mL. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The in vitro antimicrobial properties of this silver-coated nylon wound dressing are promising for future prevention of equine wound infections.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in the newborn: a prospective study of mortality and morbidity.
AB  - Neonatal bacterial meningitis is a serious disease around the world, with the incidence changing little in the past 30 years. Group B streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae are common causative organisms and lumbar puncture remains the definitive method of diagnosis. The mortality rate has declined in industrialized countries over the years, from almost 50% in the 1970s to less than 10% in 1997. However, neurological sequelae are still frequently observed despite major changes in treatment. Preliminary analysis of our own data from a prospective study of cases in the United Kingdom suggests that treatment with third generation cephalosporins is related to a decrease in mortality but not morbidity.
TI  - Susceptibility to levofloxacin of clinical isolates of bacteria from intensive care and haematology/oncology patients in Switzerland: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the susceptibility of clinical isolates to levofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone with extended activity against Gram-positive bacteria, and other antibiotics in 12 Swiss clinical microbiology laboratories using the NCCLS disc diffusion technique. Isolates were prospectively collected from intensive care units (ICUs (59%), oncology wards (7%) and other units with haematology/oncology patients (34%) from June 1995 to March 1996. The levofloxacin breakpoints used were as recommended by the manufacturer. A total of 310 Gram-positive and 580 Gram-negative isolates from the respiratory tract (36%), skin/wounds (12%), blood (16%), urine (17%) and other sources (19%) were tested. The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin was 100% for Enterococcus spp. (38 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (13), Streptococcus pneumoniae (65), Acinetobacter spp. (11), Citrobacter diversus (6), Citrobacter freundii (17), Klebsiella oxytoca (39), Morganella morganii (16), Proteus mirabilis (20), Proteus vulgaris (23), Serratia spp. (19), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (10) and Haemophilus influenzae (41). The percentage of isolates susceptible to levofloxacin for Staphylococcus aureus (95 strains, including 2% MRSA) was 94%, coagulase-negative staphylococci (85) 65%, Enterobacter spp. (75) 99%, Escherichia coli (111) 97%, Klebsiella pneumoniae (45) 98% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (124) 87%. In conclusion, levofloxacin is a new fluoroquinolone to which the most common clinical isolates in Switzerland are susceptible. The susceptibility of Enterococcus spp. and S. pneumoniae to levofloxacin was particularly remarkable. This compound appears to be a promising therapeutic alternative for the treatment of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,241 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1996. The results were as follows: Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae and showed low activities against MRSA. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ampicillin and piperacillin. The carbapenems showed high activities against Haemophilis influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Enterobacter cloacae. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains of Serratia marcescens were detected. The antibacterial activity of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was comparable to that of CAZ, and there were some resistant strains.
TI  - Ankylosing spondylitis in monozygotic twins: studies on immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine immunological parameters that might explain disease discordance in monozygotic twin pairs with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 11 monozygotic twin pairs (nine with AS, two with undifferentiated spondyloarthropathy) were investigated. The peripheral T cell receptor Vbeta repertoire was investigated using FACS analysis and 14 different Vbeta antibodies. In addition serum samples were tested for antibodies to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Candida albicans, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity against a number of bacteria was investigated by interferon gamma ELISPOT assays. RESULTS: Twins suffering from AS showed cellular hyporeactivity against K pneumoniae, S pyogenes, C albicans in the ELISPOT assays compared with healthy twins. In contrast with the antibody data, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups, AS concordant twins showed the most pronounced differences in their Vbeta repertoire on CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular hyporeactivity of peripheral blood cells to bacterial antigens might reflect defective T cell responses allowing bacterial antigens to persist in diseased patients. There are probably other environmental factors that influence disease concordance.
TI  - Bacteraemia in febrile children presenting to a pae3iatric emergency department.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacteraemia in young febrile children presenting to a paediatric emergency department. DESIGN: Prospective observational case study. SETTING: Emergency Department of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, between May 1996 and May 1997. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 3-36 months presenting to the Emergency Department with temperature > or = 39 degrees C and without specific viral illnesses (varicella, croup or herpes gingivostomatitis). OUTCOME MEASURES: Bacteraemia (defined as presence of pathogenic bacteria in a blood culture), white blood cell count (WCC), McCarthy score, and final diagnosis based on clinical features and investigations. RESULTS: Bacteraemia was identified in 18 of 534 patients (3.4%). Pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Neisseria meningitidis (2) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). Increased WCC counts (P < 0.001) and brief duration of fever (P < 0.001) were associated with bacteraemia. Nevertheless, clinical features, including McCarthy scores, and high WCC counts (> or = 20 x 10(9)/L) had < 10% predictive accuracy for bacteraemia. Overall, final diagnoses in the 534 febrile children included non-specific viral infections (25%), upper respiratory tract infections (24%), otitis media (10%), gastroenteritis (9%), pneumonia (7%), and urinary tract infection (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Most urban Australian children aged 3-36 months presenting to a paediatric emergency department with temperature > or = 39 degrees C without a clinical focus have a viral infection. However, 3%-4% have occult bacteraemia. Neither clinical features nor high WCC counts reliably identify these patients. As empiric antibiotics may contribute to increasing antibiotic resistance and have not been shown to prevent the rare complication of meningitis, we believe that close contact and regular review of these patients is preferable to empiric antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of simple coumarins: structural requirements for biological activity.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a series of simple coumarins was evaluated against  8 microorganisms, including three Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae) and five Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae), using the microdilution broth method. The coumarins tested showed broad diversity regarding growth inhibitory activity with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.9 to > 12.4 microM. This study, presenting the first systematic analysis of structure-activity relationships among this group of coumarins, revealed some interesting structural requirements. While coumarins with a methoxy function at C-7 and, if present, an OH group at either the C-6 or C-8 position are invariably effective against the spectrum of tested standard bacteria (Gram-negative microorganisms including the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus), the presence of an aromatic dimethoxy arrangement is apparently favourable against those microorganisms which require special growth factors (beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). A combination of these structural features, two methoxy functions and at least one additional phenolic group as reflected by the highly oxygenated coumarins, identify promising candidates with antibacterial broad-spectrum activity.
TI  - Recurrent infections in homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - The characteristics of 214 episodes of invasive bacterial infection among 176 patients with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease were examined. Streptococcus pneumoniae occurred in 81 episodes, Salmonella spp in 70, Haemophilus influenzae type b in 30, Escherichia coli in 24, and Klebsiella spp in nine. The cumulative incidence showed that S pneumoniae and H influenzae occurred predominantly before 5 years of age and were uncommon thereafter, Salmonella spp increased almost linearly with age, and Klebsiella spp and E coli predominated in patients over 10 years of age. Escherichia coli had a different epidemiology-it was found in older children, almost entirely girls. Excluding this organism from an analysis of recurrent bacterial infections, the standardised incidence rates for second and third infections were 4.8 and 15.8 times greater, respectively, than the SS population average. This implies that the susceptibility to infection is characteristic of a subgroup of patients with SS disease and that sick patients with previous bacteraemia should be investigated early and aggressively for further infection.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in a neonatal intensive-care unit: 12 years' experience with an antibiotic control program.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of gram-positive coccal (GPC), gram-negative  bacillary (GNB), and fungal blood-stream infections (BSIs) during a 12-year period in which a consistent antibiotic treatment protocol was in place; to evaluate the efficacy of these antibiotic policies in relation to treatment, to the emergence of bacterial or fungal resistance, and to the occurrence of infection outbreaks or epidemics. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and bacteriological information from 363 infants born during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997 who developed 433 blood-culture-proven BSIs was analyzed. Early-onset BSIs were defined as those infections discovered within 48 hours of birth, and late-onset BSIs as those that occurred thereafter. Suspected early-onset BSIs were treated with ampicillin and gentamicin, and suspected late-onset BSIs with vancomycin and gentamicin. Antibiotics were changed on the basis of organism antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: Early-onset BSIs were noted in 52 of 21,336 live births and 40 of 20,402 live births during 1986 through 1991 and 1992 through 1997, respectively. GPC (83% due to group B streptococcus [GBS]) accounted for approximately one half of early-onset BSI cases and GNB (68% Enterobacteriaceae) for the remainder. Early-onset GBS declined from 24 to 11 cases (P=.04) and late-onset BSI increased from 111 to 230 cases (P<.01) from the first to the last study period. Sixty-eight percent of late-onset BSIs were due to GPC (primarily coagulase-negative Staphylococcus), 18% to GNB, and 14% to fungus. Over the study period, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the newborn intensivecare unit (unlike those strains from other hospital units) remained fully susceptible to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Although the hospitalwide prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus increased, all 17 newborn BSI cases were due to methicillin-sensitive strains. Prevalence of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus increased, although all strains remained vancomycin-susceptible, as did the 16 Enterococcus faecalis isolates. All fungi recovered (from 48 patients) were susceptible to amphotericin. CONCLUSION: We observed a decrease in the prevalence of early-onset BSIs due to GBS and an increase in late-onset BSIs due to GPC, GNB, and fungi. The combination of ampicillin and gentamicin for suspected early-onset BSIs and vancomycin and gentamicin for late-onset BSIs has been successful for treatment of individual patients without the occurrence of infection outbreaks or the emergence of resistance. Controlled antibiotic programs and periodic evaluations based on individual unit and not on hospitalwide antibiograms are advisable.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview from Korea.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacteria has become a worldwide problem. Available data suggest that the resistance problem is comparatively more serious in Korea. In large hospitals, the proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has been reported at over 70%, and of penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at around 70%. Infection or colonization of vancomycin-resistant enterococci has started to increase. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae has become widespread and even carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been increasing. Community-acquired pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are often resistant to various antimicrobial agents. The prevalence of resistant bacteria can lead to erroneous empirical selection of either noneffective or expensive drugs, prolonging hospitalization and higher mortality. The emergence and spread of resistant bacteria are unavoidable unless antimicrobial agents are not used at all. The high prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea seems to be related to antibiotic usage: 1) easy availability without prescription at drug stores, 2) injudicious use in hospitals, and 3) uncontrolled use in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries. Nosocomial infection is an important factor in the spread of resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance problems should be regarded as the major public health concern in Korea. It is urgently required to ban the sale of antibiotics without prescription, to use antibiotics more judiciously in hospitals by intensive teaching of the principles of the use of antibiotics, and to establish better control measures of nosocomial infections. Regulation of antimicrobials for other than human use should also be required. These issues are not easy to address and require the collective action of governments, the pharmaceutical industry, health care providers, and consumers.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  - The results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk of the fetus intranatal infection. During the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. haemolyticus and Enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. On the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. The study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin B, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. The S.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. When the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently available antibiotics. Because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.
TI  - [Evaluation of a multi-hospital cooperative study on the efficacy and safety of panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) on elderly patients of respiratory infections].
AB  - The efficacy and safety of Panipenem/Betamipron (PAPM/BP) on elderly patients of  respiratory infections was examined at 17 hospitals in a cooperative study. Among the 95 case, we examined the efficacy of the medication in 86 cases, and the safety in all 95 cases. Efficacy was confirmed in 81.3% of pneumonia patients, 57.7% of secondary-infection patients of chronic respiratory diseases, and 74.4% of the total. No significant difference was observed among each group according to age, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or when broadly comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. The microbiological efficacy was 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 80% for Staphylococcus aureus, 80% in Klebsiella pneumoniae; therefore, a very good disappearance rate of symptoms could be obtained in all major respiratory etiologic agents except Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we also examined other factors considered to affect the course of treatment for elderly patients of infectious diseases, namely the presence of absence of underlying diseases, the distinctness of infectious symptoms, the patient's condition before the appearance of infectious symptoms, and previous history of treatment with antimicrobial agents. For safety, the incidence rate of side effects was 14.7%, which was similar to the 16.9% in the developmental study. These two findings were also similar in content. No significant difference was observed among each age group, comparing patients > or = 65 years old grouped by 5 years, or comparing groups < 75 years and > or = 75 years of age. From the above evaluation, we consider PAPM/BP to be an effective drug for normal adult patients as well as elderly patients of respiratory infections.
TI  - Bacterial pneumonia as a suprainfection in young adults with measles.
AB  - The aim of this study was to report the clinical and laboratory characteristics of bacterial pneumonia related to measles infection, and also to assess any correlation between severity and time of onset. Four hundred and twenty-four previously healthy young males (age 22+/-2.1 yrs) were hospitalized with typical symptoms and signs of measles. One hundred and twelve (26%) developed bacterial pneumonia on admission (n=41), during their hospital stay (n=20) or days after their discharge (n=51): groups A, B and C, respectively. Single lobar consolidation was the most common finding, accounting for 89% of cases. Pleural effusion was uncommon and associated in half of the cases with empyema. A microbiological diagnosis was made in 81 cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae (65 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9 cases) were the most commonly identified organisms. Patients from group C had significantly higher values of white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lower values of arterial oxygen tension (14+/-0.8 x 10(9) x L(-1), 88+/-4 mm and 6.3+/-0.4 kPa (47+/-3 mmHg), respectively) than the other two groups. There were no deaths during the hospitalization period. The mean duration of hospital stay was 13+/-2.4 days and was longer in the presence of K. pneumoniae infection (19+/-1.6 days). Six patients from group C were admitted to the intensive care unit. In conclusion, these data suggest that bacterial pneumonia associated with measles is not unusual in hospitalized adults, and it seems to be more severe when it occurs days after the onset of rash.
TI  - The biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  - Cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. Some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. The aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(L-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tyrosyl-L-prolyl), cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-prolyl) and cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). The enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The induction of differentiation in HT-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. Antibiotic properties against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilus and Streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the Kirby-Bauer disc-diffusion assay. Results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Three of the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. All the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. These results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.
TI  - In vivo activities of peptidic prodrugs of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl-1  beta-methylcarbapenems.
AB  - A series of novel aminomethyl tetrahydrofuranyl (THF)-1 beta-methylcarbapenems which have excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activities exhibit modest efficacies against acute lethal infections (3.8 mg/kg of body weight against Escherichia coli and 0.9 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus) in mice when they are administered orally. In an effort to improve the efficacies of orally administered drugs through enhanced absorption by making use of a peptide-mediated transport system, several different amino acids were added at the aminomethyl THF side chains of the carbapenem molecules. The resulting peptidic prodrugs with L-amino acids demonstrated improved efficacy after oral administration, while the D forms were less active than the parent molecules. After oral administration increased (3 to 10 times) efficacy was exhibited with the alanine-, valine-, isoleucine-, and phenylalanine-substituted prodrugs against acute lethal infections in mice. Median effective doses (ED50s) of < 1 mg/kg against infections caused by S. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, or penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae were obtained after the administration of single oral doses. Several of the peptidic prodrugs were efficacious against Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli infections, with ED50s of 1 to 14 mg/kg by oral administration compared with ED50s of 14 to > 32 mg/kg for the parent molecules. In general, the parent molecules demonstrated greater efficacy than the prodrugs against these same infections when the drugs were administered by the subcutaneous route. The parent molecule was detectable in the sera of mice after oral administration of the peptidic prodrugs.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ciproflaxacin, ofloxacin, and broad-spectrum beta-lactams against aerobe blood culture isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with  that of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and meropenem against 613 consecutively recovered blood isolates from recently hospitalized patients. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution according to NCCLS guidelines. Test strains included Acinetobacter species (n = 26), Escherichia coli (n = 137), Enterobacter species (n = 27), Klebsiella species (n = 42), Proteus species (n = 16), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 28), Serratia marcescens (n = 13), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 7), enterococci (n = 54), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 38), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 137), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 27), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 13), and viridans group streptococci (n = 48). The overall respective MICs at which 50% and 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC50s and MIC90s) were as follows: trovafloxacin, 0.06 and 1 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 0.25 and 4 mg/l; ofloxacin, 0.5 and 4 mg/l; fleroxacin, 0.5 and 16 mg/l; ceftazidime, 2 and 128 mg/l; piperacillin/tazobactam, 2 and 8 mg/l; meropenem, 0.06 and 4 mg/l. For the quinolones, the rank order of activity against gram-negative microorganisms was ciprofloxacin > trovafloxacin > ofloxacin = fleroxacin, against gram-positive organisms, trovafloxacin > ciprofloxacin = ofloxacin > fleroxacin. Data obtained showed the similar activity of trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin against gram-negative pathogens and the superior activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive bacteria thus making it a potential candidate for the empiric treatment of patients with suspected bacteremia and sepsis.
TI  - Spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation is a rare and lethal complication in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. METHODOLOGY: Data of 9 patients with spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation occurring during chemotherapy were reviewed. RESULTS: All 9 patients were male with an average age of 54.4+/-2.5 years. The primary malignancies included 5 head and neck cancers, 2 esophageal cancers, 1 malignant lymphoma, and 1 hepatocellular carcinoma. Abdominal pain was the most common symptom. The average interval between the onset of symptoms and surgery was 2.9+/-0.7 days (range: 16 hours to 7 days). Perforation was located on the duodenum (6 patients) and on the lower part of the body of the stomach (3 patients). Simple closure of the perforation was performed on 8 patients, and subtotal gastrectomy on 1 patient. Culture of the ascitic fluid of 8 patients revealed E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus viridans, and enterococcus. Four patients (44.4%) had post-operative complications. The 30-day post-operative mortality was 44.4% (4/9). Three patients died of sepsis with multiple organ failure, and 1 died of hepatic failure. Age, anaemia, leukopenia, serum albumin levels, impaired renal or liver functions are not significant operative risk factors. Pre-operative shock is a significant factor in predicting operative mortality and complications. CONCLUSIONS: High index with suspicion of the disease with early treatment may improve survival of cancer patients with spontaneous gastroduodenal perforation.
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients: a 3-year prospective study in Japan.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan and Western countries, the causative pathogens were prospectively investigated in patients requiring hospitalization. DESIGN: Prospective study over a 3-year period. SETTING: A community general hospital in Japan. PATIENTS: Three hundred twenty-six episodes of community-acquired pneumonia in 318 patients admitted to the hospital between July 1994 and June 1997. METHODS: The microbiological diagnosis was based on the results of quantitative sputum culture, blood culture, and other invasive procedures, including transthoracic needle aspiration or bronchoscopic examination. Serologic tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp, Legionella spp, and viruses were also routinely performed. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were identified in 199 episodes (61%). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (23%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (7.4%), M pneumoniae (4.9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.3%). The Streptococcus milleri group and Chlamydia pneumoniae were detected in 3.7 and 3.4% of the episodes, respectively. Pneumonia due to Legionella spp was recognized in only two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan did not differ markedly when compared with that of Western countries except for the low incidence of Legionella pneumonia. C pneumoniae and the S milleri group, which are emerging or newly recognized pathogens, were also significant causative microorganisms.
TI  - 3-trifluoromethylcarbacephems: synthesis of broad spectrum antibacterial compounds.
AB  - The enhanced stability of the carbacephem nucleus over the corresponding cephalosporin nucleus has allowed the synthesis of 7-arylglycyl-3-trifluoromethyl-carbacephems. These unique carbacephems possess broad spectrum activity and high stability to both plasmid and chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - A distinctive cutaneous reaction pattern indicative of infection by reactive arthropathy-associated microbial pathogens: the superantigen ID reaction.
AB  - The two major cutaneous expressions of infective states are infections of the skin by viable organisms and immunological responses to nonviable microbial antigens or, in the case of molecular mimickry, their human analogues. These immunological responses are designated as cutaneous id reactions, and manifest a histomorphology similar to that seen at the primary infective site. This study presents the clinical and histological findings in 16 patients who developed skin eruptions associated with extracutaneous or systemic infections. There was a striking female predominance; patients ranged in age from 10 to 78 years. The majority of cases manifested skin lesions which clinically resembled Sweet's syndrome, erythema multiforme and/or erythema nodosum. Fever, arthralgia, oligoarthritis, mucosal ulcers of the mouth and/ or genital tract and uveitis were additional features in some cases. Isolated clinical presentations included a petechial rash in a stocking and glove distribution, papular dermatitis, a morbilliform eruption and annular erythema. Among the medical and family histories were atopy and stigmata associated with connective tissue disease (CTD). Two patients were ingesting drugs with known immune dysregulating properties. Skin biopsies showed focal lymphocytic interface dermatitis, a diffuse interstitial histiocytic infiltrate, and a mononuclear cell predominant vascular reaction which in some cases represented vasculitis by virtue of manifesting concomitant luminal or mural fibrin deposition. Eosinophils, eczematous alterations, and papillary dermal edema were identified in a minority of cases. All patients had evidence of a prior or concurrent infection, based on either positive IgM serology for specific microbes or cultures. Among the implicated pathogens were cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, streptococcus, mycoplasma, klebsiella, and Borrelia burgdorferi. All of these organisms are among those associated with reactive arthritis, a phenomenon that was seen in some cases. The histology suggested florid cell mediated immunity (CMI), which the authors attributed to the superantigen properties held by the aforesaid pathogens. Skin lesions and constitutional symptoms resolved quickly with antimicrobial therapy in 7 of 9 cases causally linked to bacteria. Spontaneous resolution occurred in 5 of 6 virally mediated eruptions. The other 4 patients were given topical steroids or prednisone; these included 1 patient with Borrelia burgdorferi infection and 1 patient with radiographic evidence of pneumonia who was never cultured, 1 patient with parvovirus B19 infection, and 1 patient with pneumococcal pneumonia and concomitant sarcoidosis. It is the authors' belief that the eruptions seen in these patients may in part reflect a genetic or iatrogenic predisposition to respond excessively to certain infectious triggers.
TI  - Community-acquired septicaemia in southern Viet Nam: the importance of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi.
AB  - In a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern Viet Nam. Gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly Salmonella typhi (67%), Sal. para-typhi A (3%), Escherichia coli (10%), and Klebsiella spp. (5%). Other Salmonella spp. (1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), Neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. Staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common Gram-positive isolates. Patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (P < 0.001) and had a lower mortality rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; P < 0.0001). Over 70% of the Sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. Multidrug-resistant Sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in Viet Nam.
TI  - Microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses.
AB  - To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of liver and spleen abscesses and correlate the results with predisposing factors, potential causes and routes of infection, clinical and laboratory data of 48 patients with liver abscesses and 29 with spleen abscesses treated between 1970 and 1990 were reviewed retrospectively. In liver abscesses, a total of 116 isolates (2.4 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 43 were aerobic and facultative species (0.9 isolates/specimen) and 73 were anaerobic species or microaerophilic streptococci (1.5 isolates/specimen). Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from 12 (25%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria only from eight (17%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 28 (58%); polymicrobial infection was present in 38 (79%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (11 isolates), Streptococcus group D (8), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (18 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (13), Fusobacterium spp. (10), Clostridium spp. (10) and Prevotella spp. (4). There were 12 isolates of micro-aerophilic streptococci. S. aureus and beta-haemolytic streptococci were associated with trauma; Streptococcus group D, K. pneumoniae and Clostridium spp. with biliary disease; and Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with colonic disease. In splenic abscesses, a total of 56 isolates (1.9 isolates/specimen) was obtained; 23 were aerobic and facultative species (0.8 isolates/specimen), 31 were anaerobic species or micro-aerophilic streptococci (1.1 isolates/specimen) and two were Candida albicans. Aerobic bacteria only were isolated from nine (31%) abscesses, anaerobic bacteria from eight (28%), mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 10 (34%) and C. albicans in two (7%); polymicrobial infection was present in 16 (55%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were E. coli (5 isolates), Proteus mirabilis (3), Streptococcus group D (3), K. pneumoniae (3) and S. aureus (4). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (11 isolates), Bacteroides spp. (5), Fusobacterium spp. (3) and Clostridium spp. (3). S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Streptococcus group D were associated with endocarditis, E. coli with urinary tract and abdominal infection, Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. with abdominal infection and Fusobacterium spp. with respiratory infection.
TI  - The benefit of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment in patients with bloodstream infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To test whether empirical antibiotic treatment that matches the in vitro susceptibility of the pathogen (appropriate treatment) improves survival in patients with bloodstream infections; and to measure the improvement. DESIGN: Observational, prospective cohort study. SETTING: University hospital in Israel. SUBJECTS: All patients with bloodstream infections detected during 1988-94. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital fatality rate and length of hospitalization. RESULTS: Out of 2158 patients given appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment, 436 (20%) died, compared with 432 of 1255 patients (34%) given inappropriate treatment (P = 0.0001). The median durations of hospital stay for patients who survived were 9 days for patients given appropriate treatment and 11 days for patients given inappropriate treatment. For patients who died, the median durations were 5 and 4 days, respectively (P < 0.05), for both comparisons. In a stratified analysis, fatality was higher in patients given inappropriate treatment than in those given appropriate treatment in all strata but two: patients with infections caused by streptococci other than Streptococcus gr. A and Streptoccocus pneumoniae (odds ratio (OR) of 1.0, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.4-2.5); and hypothermic patients (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.3-2.4). Even in patients with septic shock, inappropriate empirical treatment was associated with higher fatality rate (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.0-2.7). The highest benefit associated with appropriate treatment was observed in paediatric patients (OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 2.4-10.7); intra-abdominal infections (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 2.0-7.1); infections of the skin and soft tissues (OR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.8-5.6); and infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.7-5.1) and S. pneumoniae (OR = 2.6, 95% C = 1.1-5.9). On a multivariable logistic regression analysis, the contribution of inappropriate empirical treatment to fatality was independent of other risk factors (multivariable adjusted OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3-1.9). CONCLUSION: Appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was associated with a significant reduction in fatality in patients with bloodstream infection.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antibiotics on 1,116 clinical gram-positive and gram-negative isolates.
AB  - A total of 1,116 clinically isolated strains belonging to Staphylococcus aureus (200), Staphylococcus epidermidis (200), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20), Escherchia coli (200), Klebsiella spp. (177), Serratia marcescens (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (224), Haemophilus influenzae (35) and Salmonella (38) from the Department of Infectious Diseases, La Sapienza University in Rome (Italy) were tested against three fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and 10 other antibiotics (augmentin, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, minocycline, oxacillin and vancomycin). Fluoroquinolones inhibited essentially about 100% of H. influenzae, Salmonella and S. pneumoniae, more than 75% of Staphylococcus including methicillin-resistant strains, and about 90% of Enterobacteriaceae and 50% of P. aeruginosa. Minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from < 0.015 to > 32 micrograms/ml for Klebsiella, S. aureus and epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa; from < 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml for Salmonella; from 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml for Serratia; from < 0.015 to 1 microgram/ml for Haemophilus; and from 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae. Levofloxacin and to a lesser extent ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, generally exhibited a greater activity than the other agents against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the distribution of resistant strains in Italy, we found a peculiar pattern of resistance as far as E. coli and P. aeruginosa were concerned. Quality control parameters are also summarized. S. epidermidis resulted as a new emergent pathogen especially in immunocompromised patients and its level of sensitivity has been modified over the last few years. In fact, the percentage of resistant strains to antibiotics or the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (in our study 35%), has gradually increased. Levofloxacin and ofloxacin showed good activity against staphylococcal strains compared with the majority of other antibiotics. These results suggest that the newer quinolones are promising antimicrobial agents for various infections.
TI  - Tuberculosis is the commonest cause of pneumonia requiring hospitalization during Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah).
AB  - The diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia in mass gathering situations is a medical challenge, requiring prompt decision making and knowledge of the aetiology. We studied cases of pneumonia admitted to two hospitals during the 1994 pilgrimage (Hajj) season to Makkah. Sixty-four patients were enrolled in the study, of which 47 (75%) were men with a mean age of 63 years (range 21-91). Nearly all were from developing countries. Diagnosis was established in 46 patients (72%) with Mycobacterium tuberculosis being the commonest causative organism (20%), followed by gram-negative bacilli (18.8%). Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for only 10%, with Legionella pneumophilia, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and viruses accounting each for 6%. The main finding of this study is that M. tuberculosis is a common cause of pneumonia under these unusual "extreme circumstances". Its presentation was acute and indistinguishable from pyogenic pneumonia. Thirty-one per cent of tuberculous cases had upper lobe involvement, 54% lower lobe, and 15% multi-lobar. This was similar to the radiographic features in non-tuberculous pneumonia cases. All but one patient with tuberculosis recovered following the administration of first-line anti-tuberculous drugs. The total mortality was 17%. The preponderance of M. tuberculosis and Gram-negative bacteria over S. pneumoniae may reflect the prior use of amoxycillin and the effect of exhaustion, malnutrition, and old age.

TI  - [In vitro activity of trovafloxacin in 238 respiratory pathogens].
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 238 clinical isolates obtained from respiratory specimens were compared with ciprofloxacin. Fifty-four Haemophilus influenzae, 58 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 40 Moraxella catarrhalis, 21 Streptococcus pyogenes, 25 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 40 Staphylococcus aureus (21 methicillin resistant and 19 methicillin susceptible) were studied. The MIC was determined following NCCLS recommendations. Ciprofloxacin and trovafloxacin MIC90 was 0.016 mg/l and 0.016 mg/l for H. influenzae, 4 mg/l and 0. 25 mg/l for S. pneumoniae, </=0.008 mg/l and </=0.008 mg/l for M. catarrhalis, 0.5 mg/l and 0.064 mg/l for S. pyogenes, 0.064 mg/l and 0.25 mg/l for K. pneumoniae, 16 mg/l and 0.5 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 2 mg/l and 0.032 mg/l for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. According to this data, trovafloxacin showed better in vitro activity than ciprofloxacin in the Gram-positive pathogen studied and similar activity against the Gram-negatives tested.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  - Clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. A total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. The traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). Anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). A total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. The predominant anaerobic bacteria included Bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), Peptostreptococcus spp (113), Clostridium spp (78), Prevotella spp (58), and Fusobacterium spp (23). The predominant aerobic bacteria included Escherichia coli (83), Staphylococcus aureus (61), Streptococcus pyogenes (27), Streptococcus group D (16), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16). The types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). S. aureus was isolated at all sites. However, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). This study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  - Susceptibility of European respiratory tract isolates to trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, azithromycin and ampicillin.
AB  - As part of the Artemis project, 11500 isolates (3000 from patients with respiratory tract infections) were collected throughout six European countries between 1994 and 1996. Twenty-seven hospitals or laboratories participated in this first phase of the study. The activities of three classes of antimicrobial agents (fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam agents, macrolides) are presented for the six most frequently isolated pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae). Overall, trovafloxacin and ciprofloxacin activities were similar for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 6% were resistant to penicillin. Trovafloxacin had the highest activity against the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.25 mg/l for 90% of isolates (MIC90); all strains tested were susceptible to trovafloxacin. The MIC90 of ciprofloxacin for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 3 mg/l, and overall 52% of the strains were susceptible; 9% were resistant. Azithromycin and clarithromycin exhibited similar activity against all collected pathogens, except Haemophilus influenzae. All strains of Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to azithromycin compared with 79% for clarithromycin, with respective MIC90s of 2 and 16 mg/l. The data presented demonstrate differences in the susceptibility patterns of six major respiratory tract pathogens in Europe.
TI  - Bacteraemia in the adult intensive care unit of a teaching hospital in Nottingham, UK, 1985-1996.
AB  - Bacteraemia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the intensive care unit. In this study the distribution of organisms causing bacteraemic episodes in patients in the adult intensive care unit of a large teaching hospital was determined. Particular emphasis was placed on the type of organisms isolated from community- and hospital-acquired bacteraemia, the suspected source of infection, the possible risk factors associated with bacteraemia, and outcome. The incidence of bacteraemia and fungaemia increased from 17.7 per 1000 admissions in 1985 to 80.3 in 1996. A total of 315 episodes of bacteraemia and fungaemia were documented over a 12-year period, of which 18% were considered community-acquired and 82% hospital-acquired. Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria accounted for 46.9% and 31.5% of the episodes, respectively. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 17.8% and fungi for 3.8% of the episodes. Staphylococcus aureus (22.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.6%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (7.9%) were the predominant gram-positive bacteria implicated, whereas Escherichia coli (6%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Klebsiella aerogenes (3.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.1%), and Acinetobacter spp. (3.8%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated. The two most common sources of infection were the respiratory tract (39.7%) and an intravascular line (24.5%), but in 8.9% of episodes the focus of infection remained unknown. Bacteraemic patients stayed in the unit for a longer period (12 days) than did non-bacteraemic patients (3 days). The overall mortality related to bacteraemia and candidaemia was 44.4%. Surveillance of bacteraemia in the intensive care unit is important in detecting major changes in aetiology, e.g., the increasing incidence of gram-positive bacteraemia, the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 1995, and the emergence of Enterobacter cloacae. It is of value in determining empirical antimicrobial therapy to treat presumed infection pending a microbiological diagnosis and in directing the development of guidelines for infection prevention, e.g., guidelines for central venous catheter care.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory infectious diseases to antibiotics (1996)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 16 institutions around the entire Japan, 557 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 449 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1996 to September 1997. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 98 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 93 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 84 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 84 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 17 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 31 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 21 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 67.3%. The frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased comparing to the previous year's 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) and vancomycin (VCM) showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM) of carbapenems showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. Faropenem (FRPM) showed the next potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. The other drugs except erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and tetracycline (TC) were active against S. pneumoniae tested with MIC80s of 8 micrograms/ml or below. 3) H. influenzae The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested with MIC80s of 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), cefmenoxime (CMX), cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) Tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS), IPM, gentamicin (GM), ABK and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the next potent activities, with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) TOB and CPFX showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80s of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of piperacillin (PIPC) and cefoperazone (CPZ) were 16 micrograms/ml in 1995, and they were 64 micrograms/ml in 1996. 6) K. pneumoniae All drugs except ampicillin (ABPC) were active against K. pneumoniae. CMX, cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and carumonam (CRMN) showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC80s of the other drugs ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M.(B) catarrhalis Against M.(B.) catarrhalis, all drugs showed good activities with MICs of 4 micrograms/ml or below. IPM and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activities with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examined for 557 isolates from 449 cases. The examination of age distribution indicated that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 71.0% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportions of diagnosed diseases were as follows: Bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis were the most frequent with 35.9% and 30.3% respectively. They were followed by bronchiectasis with a proportion of 10.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens (non-Mycobacterium) from sputum culture and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - Sputum culture of patients at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok was 49.84% positive for bacterial pathogens in 1994 and 40.95% in 1995. The average incidence of gram-negative rods was 3.11 fold more than the combination of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative cocci. The most common gram-negative rod was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by either Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter anitratus depending on year. The most common coccus was Staphylococcus aureus. From both years, the number of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Nocardia spp isolated were 122, 93, 13 and 11 strains respectively. For antimicrobial susceptibility, P. aeruginosa was sensitive to ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, amikacin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin (range 56-89%). S. aureus (MSSA) was sensitive to common used drugs. S. aureus (MRSA) was sensitive to co-trimoxazole, fosfomycin, vancomycin (range 57-100%) and resistant to most drugs.
TI  - Aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia in Singapore.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the aetiology and outcome of severe community-acquired pneumonia, and to assess whether the existing guidelines for initial antimicrobial therapy are being applied. The records of 57 consecutive nonimmunocompromised patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) between January 1989 and May 1993 with this diagnosis were reviewed. The microbiological data, chest radiographic changes and outcome were analysed. Nine (16%) of the 57 patients had pulmonary tuberculosis. When these patients were excluded from further analysis, a microbiological diagnosis was made in 41 (72%) cases. The most commonest pathogens were Burkholderia pseudomallei (n=10), Klebsiella spp. (n=5) and Staphylococcus aureus (n=5), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n=4) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=2) were less common. This microbiological spectrum was quite different from that in the West, where the incidence of S. pneumoniae was higher. Also, when pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded, the mortality (67%) was much higher than that in other series. This was attributed to the high incidence of unrecognized B. pseudomallei infection, which is associated with a very high mortality in the region under study. In addition to applying published guidelines on severe community-acquired pneumonia, the endemicity of certain organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Burkholderia pseudomallei in different geographical regions needs to be considered when choosing initial empirical antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against gram-positive bacteria and cefuroxime-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefepime is a new, parenteral, fourth-generation antibiotic that is stable in the presence of Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. In vitro activity of cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem against Gram-positive cocci and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli was studied. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the US National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics tested. These included cefepime, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The tested clinical isolates included Gram-positive cocci (methicillin-sensitive coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group D enterococci) and cefuroxime-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Burkholderia cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia). RESULTS: The activity of cefepime against most Gram-negative bacilli other than B cepacia and X maltophilia is better than that of ceftazidime. However, cefepime is less active against these Gram-negative bacilli than ciprofloxacin and imipenem. The activity of cefepime against B cepacia and X maltophilia is less than that of ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin. Among Gram-positive cocci, cefepime was active against most isolates of methicillin-sensitive staphylococci, S pyogenes, viridans streptococci and S pneumoniae. However, cefepime has poor activity against methicillin-resistant S aureus and enterococci. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its extended spectrum of activity, cefepime has potential use as suitable empiric monotherapy for the treatment of a variety of community- and hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - The pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as Indonesia. According to the National Household Health Survey conducted by the Ministry of Health in 1992, LRTIs still rank fourth as the main cause of death in Indonesia. The problem of LRTIs could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. In some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. There are several methods of obtaining specimens from LRTIs for cultures. The easiest, most simple way is to collect expectorated sputum. Unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. Recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. One approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration or transthoracic aspiration. The second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. Both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. A total of 34 outpatients with acute LRTIs were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta, 1996. The purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide in these infections. Azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. Clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. The diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. In this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with N acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. Before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after treatment we found five strains. From serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. The most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of Streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of Staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). The atypical bacterial were: two Legionella pneumophila, one Mycoplasma pneumoniae and one Chlamydia pneumoniae. The clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in Table 1. There were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.
TI  - Minimum antimicrobial inhibitory concentration of carnosol and of the ethanol extract from Lepichinia hastata (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carnosol and of the ethanolic extract from the aerial part of Lepechinia hastata were determined against Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus (2), S. aureus "A", and S. aureus "B", (strains "A" and "B" are resistant to penicillin and ampicillin), Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Carnosol and the ethanol extract showed activity against gram (+) bacteria, but no activity against the yeast and the gram (-) bacteria.
TI  - The role of cytokines in bacterial pneumonia: an inflammatory balancing act.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. While tremendous advances have been made in the treatment of pneumonia using broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens, these approaches have resulted in the recent emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria. To understand better the role of the host immune response to pulmonary bacterial infections, several in vivo animal models have been developed using different bacterial agents: two acute infection models using Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae and one model of chronic infection using Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To summarize, the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections involves a finely orchestrated balancing act of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines. On initial encounter with deposited bacteria, resident alveolar macrophages become activated and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, resulting in the eventual generation of a proinflammatory amplification loop between resident or recruited macrophages or polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes. As the infection is cleared, a second wave of antiinflammatory cytokines is produced to localize the inflammatory response to within the lung microenvironment and eventually to downmodulate this response. Experimental perturbation of the host inflammatory "cycle" can have either beneficial or detrimental effects on bacterial clearance. With this in mind, a cautionary approach needs to be used in proposing immunoadjuvant therapies for pneumonia treatment.
TI  - Sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, comparative study. Sparfloxacin Multicenter ABECB Study Group.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Comparison of efficacy and safety of sparfloxacin vs ofloxacin for treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB). DESIGN: Multicenter, double-blind, randomized study. SETTING: Sixty-eight private offices and outpatient clinics in the United States and Canada. PATIENTS: Seven hundred ninety-eight adults with ABECB, as confirmed by the acute onset of new (or worsened from the immediate premorbid state) cough and sputum production. INTERVENTIONS: Randomization 1:1 to sparfloxacin, 400 mg on day 1, then 200 mg once daily, or ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily, with matching comparator placebos, given concurrently for 10 consecutive days. RESULTS: The primary efficacy parameter was overall response in the bacteriologically evaluable population. Overall success rates in this population were 85.3% and 89.3% for sparfloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. The two-sided 95% confidence interval was -9.9, 1.9, indicating that sparfloxacin was statistically equivalent to ofloxacin. The all-treated population analysis was similar to that in the evaluable population. Bacterial eradication rates were similar in both treatment groups for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of adverse events overall was comparable in the two treatment groups. The sparfloxacin group had a lower frequency of digestive and nervous system adverse events, but a higher frequency of photosensitivity reactions than the ofloxacin group. CONCLUSIONS: Once-daily oral treatment with 200 mg sparfloxacin (after initial 400 mg dose) is as effective as twice-daily treatment with 400 mg ofloxacin in patients with ABECB.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - Urinary excretion and bactericidal activities of a single oral dose of 400 milligrams of fleroxacin versus a single oral dose of 800 milligrams of pefloxacin in healthy volunteers.
AB  - Twelve healthy volunteers participated in this randomized crossover study to compare the concentrations and recovery levels of fleroxacin and pefloxacin in urine and to assess their bactericidal activities against 12 strains of urinary pathogens with different susceptibilities over a wide range of MICs. The volunteers received a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin or 800 mg of pefloxacin. The mean cumulative renal excretion of unchanged fleroxacin, N-demethyl-fleroxacin, and N-oxide-fleroxacin accounted for 67, 7, and 6% of the total dose, respectively. The total urinary recovery of pefloxacin and the active metabolite norfloxacin was 34%. In the time-kill and the urinary bactericidal titer (UBT) studies, only the subjects' urine not supplemented with broth was used. With most tested organisms and both quinolones it took more than 8 h to achieve a reduction in CFU of 99.9% (3 log units). Overall, there was a good correlation between UBTs and MICs for the strains. Against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 the median UBTs were similar for both antibiotics and at least 1:8 for 96 h; against the E. coli strain for which the MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml the UBT was at least 1:4 for 48 h. The UBTs of both drugs against Klebsiella pneumoniae were at least 1:16 for 72 h. The UBTs for Staphylococcus aureus (the MIC for which was 16 micrograms/ml) of both antibiotics were low, and in some of the samples, no bactericidal titers were observed. UBTs for Proteus mirabilis of pefloxacin are significantly higher than those of fleroxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the median UBTs were present for the 24-to-48-h interval. The same is true for Enterococcus faecalis. Against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, UBTs were present for at least 48 h with both quinolones. Overall, a single oral dose of 400 mg of fleroxacin exhibits UBTs comparable to those of 800 mg of pefloxacin. Therefore, it may be expected that half of the dose of fleroxacin gives comparable results in the treatment of urinary tract infections; this should be substantiated in comparative clinical trials.
TI  - [Studies on penetration of cefepime into respiratory tract using broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum].
AB  - We investigated broncho-alveolar distribution of cefepime (CFPM), a fourth generation cephem, using 38 BALF specimens from 19 serious pneumonia patients who underwent artificial respiratory system control. The mean broncho-alveolar CFPM level was 3.44 microgram/ml (5.34% of the mean peak blood level). We thus observed that the BALF level after a single dose of 1 g of CFPM exceeds the MIC90 of the drug against RTI causing bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophillus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin and tazobactam combination against clinically significant bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactum which is not among the routinely tested antibiotic at the Public Health Bacteriology Laboratory, Parirenyatwa Hospital, Harare, Zimbabwe was evaluated for its activity against bacterial pathogens using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Piperacillin/tazobactum showed superior in-vitro activity against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria when compared with routinely tested antibiotics such as gentamicin, erythromycin, tetracycline, penicillin, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid and clindamycin and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Ciprofloxacin showed in-vitro activity comparable to that of tazobactam/piperacillin. Specifically, 96% of gram positive isolates (comprising Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. For gram negative organisms, 98% of Haemophilus influenzae Shigella spp, Klebsiella spp were also sensitive to the combination. The broad spectrum of activity of piperacillin/tazobactam shows that the potential of the drug combination for the treatment of infections caused by diverse microorganisms should not be underestimated. We recommend its inclusion in routine antibiotic sensitivity testing in our hospital.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of retroperitoneal abscesses.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of various types of retroperitoneal abscesses was studied by review of the clinical and laboratory data for 161 patients treated between 1974 and 1990 for such abscesses. These included 109 anterior, 8 posterior, 21 retrofascial, and 23 pelvic retroperitoneal abscesses. A total of 472 organisms (2.9 isolates/specimen)--204 aerobic and facultative (1.3/specimen), and 268 anaerobic (1.7/specimen)--were recovered. Aerobes only were recovered from 34 abscesses (21%), anaerobes only from 34 (21%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from 93 (58%). Polymicrobial infection was present in 132 patients (82%). The predominant aerobic and facultative isolates were Escherichia coli (60 isolates), Klebsiella pneumoniae (20), Streptococcus group D (19), and Staphylococcus aureus (11). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus species (95 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis group (66), Prevotella species (22), and Clostridium species (22). The number of anaerobes per site always was greater than the number of aerobic or facultative organisms and was especially high in pelvic abscesses. The number of aerobic and facultative organisms was especially high in pancreatic abscesses. These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of retroperitoneal abscesses.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of newer oral cephalosporins in healthy volunteers.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activity of three oral cephalosporins was studied in 12 volunteers, after administration of single doses of cefuroxime axetil 250 mg, cefixime 200 mg, cefixime 400 mg and cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg. Serum bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae was measured by a standardized microdilution method. Cefuroxime axetil demonstrated the best bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms and cefixime was the most bactericidal against Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of sparfloxacin activity and spectrum against 24,940 pathogens isolated in the United States and Canada, the final analysis.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a recently marketed oral fluoroquinolone, was tested against 24,940 recent clinical strains isolated from blood stream and respiratory tract cultures at 187 hospitals in the USA and Canada. Sparfloxacin activity was compared with 5 to 13 antimicrobial agents using either Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and a reference broth microdilution or a standardized disk diffusion method. When applying recommended MIC breakpoint criteria of sparfloxacin susceptibility (< or = 0.5 microgram/mL) for Streptococcus pneumoniae (4,410 strains) and other Streptococcus spp. (554 isolates), 93% and 88% were inhibited, respectively. Furthermore, at < or = 1 microgram/mL sparfloxacin susceptibility rates for streptococci increased to 98% overall and 99.3% for S. pneumoniae. In contrast, only 46% and 68% of pneumococci were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 3 micrograms/mL; susceptible at < or = 1 microgram/mL) and penicillin (MIC90, 1.5 microgram/mL; susceptible at < or = 0.06 microgram/mL), respectively. Differences between regions in the USA for rates of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains were observed (greatest resistances in southeast and midwest), but results indicate that the sparfloxacin potency was not adversely influenced (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/mL). Also pneumococcal isolates from the lower respiratory tract were more resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactams. Nearly all Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis strains, including those harboring beta-lactamases, were susceptible to tested fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and newer oral cephalosporins. Sparfloxacin was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.12 microgram/mL; 96-97% susceptible), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90 0.12 microgram/mL), and other tested enteric bacilli (92-95% susceptible). Comparisons between the broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion interpretive results demonstrated excellent intermethod susceptibility category agreement (> 95%) using current sparfloxacin breakpoints, but some compounds (cefpodoxime disk diffusion tests for S. aureus) may require modifications. These results demonstrate that new Gram-positive focused fluoroquinolones (sparfloxacin) possess an excellent in vitro activity and spectrum against pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections. This spectrum of activity includes strains resistant to other antimicrobial classes, including the oral cephalosporins, macrolides, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and earlier fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin). Overall, sparfloxacin inhibited 89% to nearly 100% of the isolates (species variable) tested against those species against which it has Food and Drug Administration indications for clinical use.
TI  - Bacteria and viruses that cause respiratory tract infections during the pilgrimage (Haj) season in Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and type of RTI-causing bacteria and viruses during a period of epidemic infections. METHOD: A total of 395 sputum specimens and 761 throat swabs were collected during the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons (Haj to Makkah Al-Mukarama, Saudi Arabia) from patients referred to one hospital and three dispensaries with symptoms of respiratory tract infections. All 761 throat swabs of both Haj seasons were also screened for the presence of viral pathogens with monoclonal antibodies specific for 7 viruses known to cause respiratory infections. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were detected in 118 (29.9%) specimens. During the 1991 Haj season Haemophilus influenzae was the most frequent bacterial pathogen detected (10%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (3.8%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (2.4%). In the 1992 Haj season Klebsiella pneumoniae was predominant (15.1%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae (12.3%). Screening of all sputum specimens for acid-fast bacteria showed that the overall incidence rate of tuberculosis was 1%. Cultures from the 761 throat swabs were largely negative for bacteria except for Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from 7 patients. Viruses were detected in 148 (19.5%) specimens with influenza A and adenovirus being the most common viruses. CONCLUSION: The pattern of virus prevalence in the 1991 and 1992 pilgrimage seasons was identical: influenza A and adenovirus predominated. Thus these two viruses should be targeted in future prophylactic measures.

TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1996). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 680 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1996 to May 1997. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 30.4% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 69.6% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptabilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) showed the highest activity against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. Imipenem (IPM) and vancomycin (VCM) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA Arbekacin (ABK) and VCM showed the highest activities against both S. aureus and MRSA isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 or 2 micrograms/ml. The others except minocycline (MINO) had low activities with the MIC90S of 32 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and VCM showed the strongest activities against S. epidermis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 2 micrograms/ml. Cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefozopran (CZOP) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Compared with antimicrobial activities of cephems is 1995, the MIC90S of them had changed into a better state. They ranged from 4 micrograms/ml 16 micrograms/ml in 1996. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except MINO were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, CZOP, IPM, and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 micromilligrams. Tosufloxacin (TFLX) and VCM were also active with the MIC90S of 0.5 micromilligrams. 5. Citrobacter freundii Gentamicin (GM) showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 0.5 micrograms/ml. IPM and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Cefpirome (CPR) and CZOP were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 16 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and TFLX were 1 microgram/ml, the MIC90 of AMK was 2 micrograms/ml, the MIC90S of CZOP, GM and ofloxacin (OFLX) were 4 micrograms/ml. The MIC50S of cephems except CEZ, cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefaclor (CCL) had changed into a better state in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 7. Escherichia coli All drugs except penicillins and MINO were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MIC90S of them were 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Among E. coli strains, those with low susceptibilities to cephems except CEZ, cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX) and CCL have increased in 1996, compared with those in 1995. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. CPR had the strongest activity, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.25 microgram/ml. Flomoxef (FMOX), cefixime (CFIX), CZOP and carumonam (CRMN) were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. 9. Pseudomonas aeruginosa All drugs except quinolones were not so active against P. aeruginosa with the MIC90S were 32 micrograms/ml or above. Quinolones were more active in 1996 than 1995. The MIC90S of them were between 4 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml, and the MIC50S of them were between 1 microgram/ml and 2 micrograms/ml. 10. Serratia marcescens GM showed the highest activity against S. marcescens. Its MIC90 was 1 micro
TI  - [Survey of the sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 21 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance. The activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,282 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at all institutions between October and December 1995. The results were as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. The antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX and CTM. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than that exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited greater antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of cefteram and other beta-lactam agents against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of the third-generation oral cephem cefteram (CFTM)--ten years after its first use in the clinical setting--against recent clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of other oral cephems. A total of 851 clinical isolates belonging to 13 species used in this study were collected from five medical institutions across Japan during 1996. CFTM showed excellent antibacterial activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and S. pyogenes, equivalent to those of other third-generation oral cephems, except cefixime. Of the S. pneumoniae strains, a high proportion, 34.1%, were penicillin-resistant strains (PRSP), with MIC values of 2.0 micrograms/ml or above, but the MIC50 of CFTM against PRSP was 1.0 microgram/ml. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed potent antibacterial activity against E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. A few strains of E. coli, however, were highly resistant to third-generation oral cephems; that might include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains. MIC values against P. vulgaris varied significantly, depending on whether they were determined by the broth micro-dilution method or the agar dilution method; growth was observed at high concentrations in the broth micro-dilution method, in which the skip phenomenon was demonstrated, but not in the agar dilution method. The reason for this discrepancy is unknown. Most strains of S. marcescens, C. freundii, and E. cloacae demonstrated resistance to CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems. CFTM and the other third-generation oral cephems showed excellent antibacterial activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, N. gonorrhoeae, and H. influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone with potent and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The in-vitro and in-vivo activities of CFC-222 were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and sparfloxacin. Against gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (quinolone-susceptible and quinolone-resistant), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis, CFC-222 was more active than ciprofloxacin and similar to sparfloxacin. Against gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, the in-vitro activity of CFC-222 was similar to that of sparfloxacin, but less than that of ciprofloxacin. However, it was less active than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In mouse systemic infection caused by S. aureus Smith or S. aureus TMS 33, CFC-222 demonstrated an activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, but better than that of ofloxacin. The compound was more effective than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin in murine infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 8668. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae infections, the efficacy of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin. The activity of CFC-222 was similar to those of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against P. aeruginosa MB4-16 in the same infection model. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Discovery of novel pyridinopolyamines with potent antimicrobial activity: deconvolution of mixtures synthesized by solution-phase combinatorial chemistry.
AB  - A 1638-member pyridinopolyamine library, consisting of 13 sublibraries of 126 members prepared by a solution-phase approach, was completely deconvoluted from orthogonally protected intermediates by a combination of iterative and positional scanning procedures. Antibacterial assays against Streptococcus pyogenes and Escherichia coli imp- and a Candida albicans yeast specificity assay were employed to follow the activity of sublibraries. Screening of the 13 sublibraries, which were prepared by a synthetic method that places the differentiating functionality in a selected position A (secondary amine), at the end of the synthesis (fix last), provided several first-round activities. Subsequently, six single pyridinopolyamines (2-7) were prepared where the first-round winner, a hydrogen atom, is in the first deconvoluted position and the remaining three positions contained the same functionalities. The range of antibacterial and yeast activities of these single compounds suggested that a more active and selective compound may be discovered by completely deconvoluting the first-round active sublibraries. Pyridinopolyamine positions B (secondary benzylamine) and C (primary benzylamine) were then sequentially positionally scanned with a set of six meta-substituted benzyl functionalities to generate two sets of second/third-round sublibraries, containing 21 or 36 compounds in each sublibrary, respectively. High-throughput screening yielded sublibraries 15, 18, and 21 with MICs of 1-5 microM against S. pyogenes and E. coli imp-. Using rounds 1 and 2/3 screening data, two sets of single compounds (22-27) and (28-32) with the combination of m-(trifluoromethyl)-benzyl group at position C and m-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl or m-methylbenzyl group at position B with position D (primary benzylamine) fixed were synthesized in the fourth round deconvolution. Subsequently, broader screening of deconvoluted compounds against a tier II panel of wild-type bacteria identified eight compounds (5, 7, 27, and 29-32) with approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, S. pyogenes, S. pyogenes (wild-type), Streptomyces aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited at MICs of 1-12 microM, whereas MICs for E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were > 100 microM. These eight compounds were not active (> 100 microM) against fungus C. albicans.
TI  - Emerging pathogens for pneumonia in Singapore.
AB  - The death rate from pneumonia in Singapore has increased steadily over the past decade. The emerging respiratory pathogens may have contributed to this increased mortality. New challenges have arisen from changes in the characteristics of the host and the susceptibilities of the various pathogens to antibiotics. There has been a 60-fold increase in the incidence of penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, the major pathogen for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Gram-negative bacilli are the major pathogens in severe CAP with Klebsiella pneumonia being the most frequently isolated organism. There has been a small increase in the number of cases of Legionnaire's disease and a marked increase in the incidence of melioidosis. While the overall incidence of tuberculosis has been unchanged, the number of non-residents with tuberculosis has doubled in the past 5 years. The rising prevalence of human immunodeficiency Virus infection is reflected in an increasing number of apparently healthy young men who present with CAP caused by Pneumocystis carinii. There is increasing resistance to antibiotics among gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, the dominant pathogens in hospital-acquired pneumonia. New strategies are urgently needed to prevent the emergence of pathogens in the hospital environment which may be resistant to all known antibiotics.
TI  - The infectious complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
AB  - Infectious complications continue to have a major impact on the clinical course of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia despite advances in therapeutic approaches to this disease and supportive care. Although the pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial, systemic hypogammaglobulinemia is the major immune defect accounting for the increased risk of infection. Despite common knowledge of systemic immune defects in this population, information regarding mucosal immune function is minimal. In patients treated with conventional alkylating agents, infections commonly occur at mucosal sites, especially the respiratory tract, and organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequent isolates. The use of purine analogues as fludarabine has resulted in a change in this spectrum of infection, with the appearance of opportunistic infections caused by Pneumocystis, Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia, Candida, Aspergillus, and herpesviruses. Further knowledge of the impact of chemotherapy on immune function, and of the immune defects in these patients, both inherent to the primary disease process and therapy-related, will aid in the formulation of better prophylactic and therapeutic interventions to reduce the risk of infection and improve the ultimate outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
TI  - Bacterial and Ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in whom gram-positive cocci (GPC), gram-negative bacilli (GNB), or Ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. Another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of BPD. STUDY DESIGN: We correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. BPD severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w PCA) and at the time of discharge. Two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. RESULTS: Of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. GPC isolates from throat cultures were mainly Staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and Streptococcus haemolyticus. A superimposed GNB colonization was present in 37% of these infants. Most common isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Escherichia coli. Sepsis caused by GPC developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by GNB. Infants infected with GNB remained receiving oxygen at 36 w PCA and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS: Hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. Mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. High radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w PCA. Infants infected with U. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. CONCLUSION: GPC, GNB, and U. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. GNB-infected infants had the most severe BPD course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. U. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe BPD or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.
TI  - Bacterial growth in human vitreous humor.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of human vitreous to support bacterial growth and to show differences in the growth kinetics of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Vitreous gel of 70 keratoplasty donor eyes was sampled under sterile conditions, screened microscopically for cellular components and tested for sterility and levels of antibiotic drugs by bio-assay. The samples were inoculated with clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus pyogenes. As control each strain was added both to 0.9% sodium chloride solution and to Mueller-Hinton broth. In order to determine bacterial growth the number of colony forming units was determined 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hr after inoculation by viable count. Vitreous gel did not support bacterial growth; the tested strains could not be recovered after 48 hr. Similar results could be obtained with sodium chloride; whereas in Mueller Hinton broth the strains showed normal pattern of growth. It seems that vitreous humor has inherent antibacterial capacity in vitro, although the responsible factors remain unknown.
TI  - Bacteriology of chronic sinusitis after ampicillin therapy.
AB  - The bacteriologies of the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were studied in 74 chronic sinusitis patients who took ampicillin (500 mg every 6 hours) for 2 weeks preoperatively. The specimens from one ipsilateral maxillary and ethmoid sinuses were obtained when undergoing functional endoscopic sinus surgery. In 74 specimens of the maxillary sinus, 38 bacterial isolates were recovered. The culture rate was 46.0%. On the other hand, 34 bacterial isolates were taken from the ethmoid sinus specimens. The culture rate was 41.9%. As compared with a previous group who did not take any antibiotic preoperatively, the culture rate significantly decreased in the maxillary as well as the ethmoid sinus specimens. Not surprisingly, a significantly decreased sensitivity to ampicillin was also found in the recovered bacteria from both the maxillary sinus (23.7%) and ethmoid sinus (5.9%) specimens. These results demonstrate that antibiotic therapy with ampicillin could eradicate most sensitive bacteria in chronic sinusitis. However, persistence of resistant bacteria was demonstrated.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts and constituents of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts and isolated constituents (scopoletin, umckalin, 5,6,7-trimethoxycoumarin, 6,8-dihydroxy-5,7-dimethoxycoumarin, (+)-catechin, gallic acid and its methyl ester) of Pelargonium sidoides and Pelargonium reniforme (Geraniaceae), plant species used in folk medicine by the Southern African native population, was evaluated against 8 microorganisms, including 3 Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus 1451) and 5 Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varied with the preparation of the extracts and microorganisms tested, from about 0.6 mg/ml for aqueous phases to over 10 mg/ml for crude Pelargonium extracts. With the exception of the ineffective (+)-catechin, all the potentially active compounds exhibited antibacterial activities with MICs of 200-1000 micrograms/ml. The results provide for a rational basis of the traditional use of the titled Pelargonium species.

TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro assessment of sparfloxacin activity and spectrum using results from over 14,000 pathogens isolated at 190 medical centers in the USA. SPAR Study Group.
AB  - Sparfloxacin, a new orally administered fluoroquinolone, was tested against 14,182 clinical strains isolated (generally blood stream and respiratory tract cultures) at nearly 200 hospitals in the United States (USA) and Canada. Sparfloxacin activity was compared with 13 other compounds by Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden), broth microdilution, or a standardized disk diffusion method. Using the Food and Drug Administration/product package insert MIC breakpoint for sparfloxacin susceptibility (< or = 0.5 microgram/ml), 94% of Streptococcus pneumoniae (2666 isolates) and 89% of the other streptococci (554 isolates) were susceptible. However, at < or = 1 microgram/ml (the breakpoint for all nonstreptococcal species) sparfloxacin susceptibility rates increased to 100% and 98%, respectively, for the two groups of streptococci. Only 50% and 65% of pneumococci were susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 3 micrograms/ml) and penicillin (MIC90, 1.5 micrograms/ml), respectively. Although there were significant differences between regions in the USA in the frequency of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal strains, results indicate that the overall sparfloxacin MIC90 was uniformly at 0.5 microgram/ml. Nearly all (> or = 99%) Haemophilus species and Moraxella catarrhalis, including those harboring beta-lactamases, were susceptible to sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Only cefprozil and macrolides demonstrated lower potency and spectrum against these two species. Sparfloxacin was active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (96 to 97%), Klebsiella spp. (95%), and other tested enteric bacilli (93%). Comparison between broth microdilution MIC and disk diffusion interpretive results for M. catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Enterobacteriaceae showed an absolute intermethod categorical agreement of > 95% using current sparfloxacin breakpoints, in contrast to those of cefpodoxime for S. aureus where a conspicuous discord (98% versus 59%) between methods was discovered. These results demonstrate that sparfloxacin possesses sufficient in vitro activity and spectrum versus pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections (indications), especially strains resistant to other drug classes such as the earlier fluoroquinolones, oral cephalosporins, macrolides, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The sparfloxacin susceptibility breakpoint for streptococci may require modification (< or = 1 microgram/ml) based on the MIC population analysis presented here. A modal MIC (0.38 to 0.5 microgram/ml) was observed at the current breakpoint. Regardless, sparfloxacin inhibited 89% (nonpneumococcal Streptococcus spp.) to 100% (Haemophilus spp., M. catarrhalis) of the isolates tested with a median activity of 97% against indicated species.
TI  - [Clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil against community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Part II].
AB  - We investigated clinical and bacteriological effects of cefetamet pivoxil (CEMT-PI) in community-acquired respiratory tract infections and obtained the following findings. That method was approximately equal to that of investigation in 1994. 1. Of the 431 respiratory tract infection cases that were treated with CEMT-PI according to a same protocol at a total of 41 institutions in Tokyo, Kanagawa-ken, Saitama-ken and Chiba-ken from January to the beginning of March 1996. Outpatients accounted for 98.1% of the subjects. Regarding genders to patients, slightly more females (52.6%) than males were included. Diagnoses given to these patients included pharyngo-laryngitis (53.5%), tonsillitis (20.4%) and acute bronchitis (19.1%). 2. We investigated clinical efficacy rates (the ratio of those excellent + good) classified by diseases. The improvement rates of pharyngo-laryngitis, tonsillitis and acute bronchitis were more than 85.0%. Other cases were small in number. That of chronic bronchitis-acute increasing change for the worse was 66.7%, pneumonia was 50.0% and bronchiectasis infection was 16.7%. It was not studied that clinical efficacy rates among those who were treated with 1 CEMT-PI tablet twice and among those who were given 2 tablets twice were significant level. 3. For the bacteriological study, a written material describing the method of collecting specimens, storage and transport in detail was distributed to the above mentioned institutions. The isolation and identification of suspected causative bacteria, determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and investigation of beta-lactamase production were conducted all together at section of studies, Tokyo Clinical Research Center. Suspected causative bacteria were detected from 274 (63.6%) cases. They included 88 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 47 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 42 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. Suspected causative bacteria classified by diseases were S. pyogenes (tonsillitis), S. pneumoniae (acute bronchitis and secondary infection of chronic respiratory infection) and H. influenzae (pharyngo-laryngitis), and the detection frequency of those was high. The clinical efficacies (the ratio of improvement) classified by suspected causative bacteria were 84.4% against organism that was indicating CEMT and were 69.2% against organism that was not indicating CEMT.
TI  - In-vitro activities of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, sparfloxacin and trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were equally active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin was the most active compound against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 = 1 mg/L), followed by trovafloxacin (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was twice as active as sparfloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 0.06 mg/L) (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, for which the MIC90 was 8 mg/L). Trovafloxacin was the most active compound against Enterococcus faecalis: 80% of strains were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L. There was complete cross-resistance between all fluoroquinolones.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacies of CFC-222, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  - CFC-222 is a novel fluoroquinolone containing a C-7 bicyclic amine moiety with potent antibacterial activities against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms. We compared the in vitro and in vivo activities of CFC-222 with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and lomefloxacin. CFC-222 was more active than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive bacteria. CFC-222 was particularly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90], 0.2 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.2 microg/ml for ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains), and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 0.39 microg/ml). Against Escherichia coli and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin (MIC90s for E. coli, 0.1 and 0.025 microg/ml, respectively). The in vitro activity of CFC-222 was not influenced by inoculum size, medium composition, or the presence of horse serum. However, its activity was decreased significantly by a change in the pH of the medium from 7.0 to 6.0, as was the case for the other quinolones tested. The in vivo protective efficacy of CFC-222 by oral administration was greater than those of the other quinolones tested in a mouse model of intraperitoneally inoculated systemic infection caused by S. aureus. CFC-222 exhibited efficacy comparable to that of ciprofloxacin in the same model of infection caused by gram-negative organisms, such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In this infection model, CFC-222 was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results suggest that CFC-222 may be a promising therapeutic agent in various bacterial infections.
TI  - [Survey of sensitivities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents (annual report)].
AB  - Research groups were formed in 20 institutions nationwide to investigate carbapenem resistance of clinical isolates. Activities of various antibacterial agents, principally carbapenems, were tested against clinical isolates collected from these institutions. The broth microdilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 17 antibacterial agents for 1,326 strains of 11 bacterial species isolated at the institutions between October and December 1994. The results are as follows: 1. Carbapenems exhibited strong antibacterial activities against MSSA and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Their activities against Enterococcus faecalis were comparable to that of ABPC. Carbapenems showed low activities against MRSA. 2. OFLX exhibited the greatest antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, followed by MEPM. Antibacterial activities of the other carbapenems were comparable to those of FMOX, CTM, and ABPC. 3. The carbapenems showed high activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacteroides fragilis group. Their activities were greater than those exhibited by other beta-lactam antibacterial agents. The carbapenems also exhibited stronger antibacterial activities against Serratia marcescens than the other beta-lactam antibacterial agents, but some resistant strains were detected. 4. The antibacterial activities of carbapenems against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were comparable to those of CAZ, AZT, AMK.
TI  - A prospective study of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in southern Israel.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the epidemiology of neonatal sepsis and meningitis in the Negev area of southern Israel. DESIGN: A prospective 8-year study conducted at the neonatal intensive care unit and pediatric wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-nine cases of hospital and community-acquired neonatal sepsis occurred during the study period. Thirty-two patients (14%) were meningitis. During this period 70,709 births (59% Jews and 41% Bedouins) were recorded; thus the rates of neonatal sepsis and meningitis were 3.2 and 0.5/1000 live births, respectively. One hundred seventeen (4/1000 live births) cases were recorded in Bedouins and 112 (2.6/1000 live births) in Jewish neonates (P < 0.001). Twenty-six percent of all sepsis cases occurred within < 24 h from birth, 25% from Days 2 to 7 of life and 49% between Days 8 and 28. A total of 251 organisms that were considered true pathogens were isolated. Fifty-seven of all isolates were Gram-negative organisms (mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (20%) and Escherichia coli (16%)). Gram-positive organisms were isolated in 41% of cases. Although E. coli was the most frequently recovered Gram-negative pathogen in community-acquired late onset sepsis, Klebsiella and Enterobacter spp. represented the most commonly isolated Gram-negative organisms in nosocomial late onset sepsis. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered in late onset sepsis were nosocomial. The incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae was 3 times higher in early onset sepsis than in late onset sepsis. All cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae sepsis occurred in Bedouins. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal sepsis and meningitis rates in southern Israel are similar to those reported in Western Europe and the United States. The incidence of neonatal sepsis is significantly higher for Bedouins than for Jewish neonates. The distribution of the main pathogens is different in southern Israel and although Gram-negative enteric organisms are predominant, S. agalactiae plays a relatively minor role in the etiology of sepsis during the first month of life. In southern Israel the etiology of community-acquired late onset sepsis is different from that of nosocomial late onset sepsis.
TI  - Development of an antimicrobial susceptibility testing method suitable for performance during space flight.
AB  - Very little is known regarding the effects of the microgravity environment of space flight upon the action of antimicrobial agents on bacterial pathogens. This study was undertaken to develop a simple method for conducting antibacterial susceptibility tests during a space shuttle mission. Specially prepared susceptibility test research cards (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.) were designed to include 6 to 11 serial twofold dilutions of 14 antimicrobial agents, including penicillins, cephalosporins, a beta-lactamase inhibitor, vancomycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. MICs of the drugs were determined by visual reading of color end points in the Vitek research cards made possible by incorporation of a colorimetric growth indicator (alamarBlue; Accumed International, Westlake, Ohio). This study has demonstrated reproducible susceptibility results in the testing of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, group A Streptococcus species, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In some instances, the MICs were comparable to those determined by a standard broth microdilution method, while in some cases the unique test media and format yielded slightly different values that were themselves reproducible. The proposed in-flight experiment will include inoculation of the Vitek cards on the ground prior to launch of the space shuttle, storage of inoculated cards at refrigeration temperature aboard the space shuttle until experiment initiation, and then incubation of the cards for 18 to 48 h prior to visual interpretation of MICs by the mission's astronauts. Ground-based studies have shown reproducible MICs following storage of inoculated cards for 7 days at 4 to 8 degrees C to accommodate the mission's time schedule and the astronaut's activities. For comparison, ground-based control (normal gravity) MIC values will be generated by simultaneous inoculation and incubation of a second set of test cards in a laboratory at the launch site. This procedure can provide for a safe and compact experiment that should yield new information on the effects of microgravity on the biological activities of various classes of antibiotics.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility in Kumasi, Ghana.
AB  - Between January, 1994 and June, 1996 a survey of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Microbiology Department, Kumasi, Ghana. A total of 11,380 bacterial isolates were cultured from eight different specimens. The sites of origin were wounds 32.2%, urine 28.1%, ear, nose and throat 3.6%, sputum 2.5% and aspirates 2.5%. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 7955 (69.9%) isolates, the main species were Escherichia coli 47.1%, Pseudomonas spp. 16.8%, Proteus spp 14.6%, Klebsiella spp 10.2%, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4.2%, Gram-positive bacteria contributed 3425 ((30.1%) of isolates, with Staphylococcus aureus 54.6% being the most predominant followed by Coagulase negative Staphylococcus 18.1%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 13.7% and Beta-haemolytic streptococci 4.1%. Escherichia coli showed 88% and 82% resistance to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole respectively with 78% being susceptible to gentamicin. Cefuroxime resistance in Gram-negative bacilli was 5%. As much as 30.6% and 21.7% of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates were resistant to Penicillin and chloramphenicol respectively. Ten per cent of Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to penicillin and 18% were resistant to flucloxacillin.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance. Epidemiology of antibiotic resistance: blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
AB  
TI  - [Trends and changes in antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates from 11 hospitals in Beijing area].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial resistance and its changes of clinical isolates in Beijing area. METHODS: The diameters of the inhibition zones of clinical isolates around antibiotic susceptibility test discs at 12 hospitals in Beijing area were computerfiled and analysed by the software of 'WHONET' according to NCCLS published in 1994. RESULTS: A total of 10,305 isolates were collected in 1995. The percentages of resistance were as follows: (1) in E. coli: amikacin, 8%, ceftazidime, 15%, the other third generation cephalosporins, about 30%, (2) in Klebsiella spp: ofloxacin, 0%, ceftazidime, 15%, ciprofloxacin, 17%, norfloxacin, 15%, ofloxacin, 5%, (4) in Staph. aureus: norvancomycin, 0%, (5) in Strep. pneumoniae: penicillin G, 9%, (6) in Enterococcus spp: norvancomycin, 7%. The antimicrobial resistant changes over a six year period from 1990 to 1995 were surveyed and it was found that resistant percentage of the most isolates to quinolones, for example norfloxacin, increased significantly year by year and no remarkable differences of resistance to antimicrobial agents but quinolones were observed in Ps. aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance should be emphasised during clinical therapy with antimicrobial agents, and trends in antimicrobial resistance of isolates should be followed.
TI  - [Diagnostic imaging and therapeutic implications in lung infections in patients with HIV-1 infection].
AB  - We studied retrospectively 132 episodes of infectious pneumonias in 89 patients examined from 1990 to 1995. Pneumocystis carinii was found to be the most common cause of pneumonia (33 patients). The other causes were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Cytomegalovirus (4), Haemophilus influentiae (4), Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), E. coli (2), Serratia marcescens (1). No etiologic agent was found in 40 cases. We stress the need of a more frequent use of invasive diagnostic procedures in the study of focal lung consolidations because this radiologic sign is highly aspecific and may be caused by too many different pathogenic agents, needing different therapies-i.e., Streptococcus pneumoniae (15 cases), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Staphylococcus aureus (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Escherichia coli (2), Pneumocystis carinii, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influentiae (1). Since there is an increase in mortality among patients treated with empiric antibiotic therapy, we stress the need of the routinary use of bronchoalveolar lavage in HIV+ patients with lung consolidation to perform specific therapy. Moreover, Pneumocystis carinii is by far the most frequent cause of diffuse interstitial infiltrates, and PCP has very suggestive clinical (dyspnea), radiologic (diffuse perihilar interstitial infiltrates; ground glass opacities; pneumatoceles) and laboratory (CD3+CD4 < 200/mcl; LDH > 600 UI/dl; PO2 < 70 mmHg) patterns, always related to the discovery of Pneumocystis carinii in escreatum. Thus, we decided to treat 15 patients with specific therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with the above diagnostic algorithm, obtaining in all of them complete clinical and radiologic recovery. To conclude, in critical patients, invasive procedures should be performed only in the cases in which PCP is clinically improbable.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1995)].
AB  - The bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections were collected by institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 567 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 459 patients with lower respiratory tract infections during the period from October 1995 to September 1996. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 74 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 82 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 104 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 85 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 18 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1) S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin (MPIPC) were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 52.7%. Arbekacin (ABK) showed the most highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 micrograms/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) showed the next highest activity with MIC80 of 1 microgram/ml. These drugs showed the high activities against MRSA with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. 2) S. pneumoniae. Most of drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem (IPM) and panipenem (PAPM), carbapenems, showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefotaxime (CTX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and cefpirome (CPR) of cephems showed the next most potent activities with MIC80S of 0.25 microgram/ml. Erythromycin (EM) and clindamycin (CLDM) showed low activities with MIC80S 128 micrograms/ml or high. Among these strains, however, 48.8% and 65.9% of respective strains were quite toward sensitive these agents with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3) H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae test with all MICs at 4 micrograms/ml or below. Cefotiam (CTM), CMX, cefditoren (CDTR) and ofloxacin (OFLX) showed the most potent activity with MIC90S to 0.063 microgram/ml. 4) P. aeruginosa. (mucoid strains) IPM and tobramycin (TOB) showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime (CAZ), cefsulodin (CFS) and carumonam (CRMN) showed next potent activity, with MIC80S of 2 micrograms/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 4 micrograms/ml to 32 micrograms/ml. 5) P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). TOB and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80S of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC80 of ampicillin (ABPC) was 128 micrograms/ml in 1994, it was 16 micrograms/ml in 1995. 6) K. pneumoniae. All drugs except ABPC were active against K. pneumoniae. CPR and CRMN showed the most potent activities against K. pneumoniae with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. The MIC80S of the other drugs ranged from 0.125 microgram/ml to 2 micrograms/ml. 7) M. (B.) catarrhalis. Against M. (B.) catarrhalis, all the drugs showed good activities with MIC80S at 4 micrograms/ml or below. And MICs of all strains were 8 micrograms/ml or below. IPM, OFLX and minocycline (MINO) showed the most potent activity with MIC80S of 0.063 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the characteristics of patients, their respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology. Patients' backgrounds were examine for 567 isolates from 459 cases. The examination of age distribution found that the proportion of patients with ages over 60 years was 66.3% of all the patients showing a slight increase over that in 1994. Proportion of differe
TI  - Cefodizime once daily in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Cefodizime (CAS 69739-16-8, HR 221) is a new third-generation cephalosporin with  pharmacokinetic properties that make it suitable for once-daily administration in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). Ninety-nine adult hospitalized patients (66 males, 33 females, median age 57.5 years) received a once-daily injection of 2 g cefodizime for LRTI. Median treatment duration was 8 days. Forty-two patients received cefodizime intravenously and 57 intramuscularly. Indications for treatment were as follows; primary lobar pneumonia (n = 36), bronchopneumonia (n = 14), secondary pneumonia (n = 3), aspiration pneumonia (n = 5), acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (n = 21), and of bronchiectasis (n = 9) and acute purulent bronchitis (n = 11). General condition was good in 29 patients and poor in 58; 12 patients were critically ill. The following pathogens were isolated at baseline (source: bronchial secretions, sputum or blood): S. pneumoniae (n = 47), Haemophilus spp. (n = 17), M. catarrhalis (n = 6), Streptococcus spp. (n = 9), Staphylococcus spp. (n = 5), Klebsiella spp. (n = 4), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 1), A. calcoaceticus (n = 1) and anaerobic organisms (n = 7). Fifty-nine patients were evaluable for bacteriological response and 82 for clinical response. Bacteriological outcome was satisfactory in 29/30 patients having LRTI with parenchymal involvement (97%) and in 29/29 patients without parenchymal involvement (100%). Clinical cure was achieved in 41/43 evaluable patients with parenchymal involvement (95%) and in 37/39 patients without parenchymal involvement (95%) in the per-protocol analysis and in 54/58 patients (93%) and 37/41 patients (93%), respectively, in the clinical intention-to-treat analysis. Three of the patients with an unsatisfactory clinical response died of infection during the study. Cefodizime was well tolerated. Adverse reactions--all of mild intensity--were tachycardia, lumbalgia and dizziness, each occurring in one patient. Cefodizime 2 g once daily either i.m. or i.v. was effective in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Single and multiple pyogenic liver abscesses: clinical course, etiology, and results of treatment.
AB  - A total of 483 patients with pyogenic liver abscess during the years 1986 to June 1995 were studied at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung: 343 were a single abscess and 140 were multiple abscesses. Males were predominantly affected by this disease. Abdominal pain was more frequent with the single abscess than with multiple abscesses, and jaundice was more frequent with multiple abscesses. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and creatinine and the white blood cell count were significantly higher in patients with multiple abscesses than in those with a single abscess; and the hemoglobin level was higher with single abscesses. The single abscess was usually larger than 5 cm, and the multiple abscesses were usually smaller than 5 cm. The single abscess was always located on the right side (72%) and the multiple abscesses always on the right or both sides. Single abscesses mainly had a cryptogenic origin (58.9%) and multiple abscesses a biliary origin (45.0%). Liver aspirates revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus, among others. K. pneumoniae was more often found in a single abscess and E. coli more often in multiple abscesses. Percutaneous catheter drainage and aspiration comprised the main treatment initially, and the failure rate with multiple abscesses was higher than that with single abscesses. Surgical intervention should be considered for multiple abscesses because of the underlying disease. The overall mortality with multiple abscesses (22.1%) was higher than that with a single abscess (12.8%). Partial hepatectomy produced a low mortality rate for both single and multiple abscesses and should be considered in the presence of severe hepatic destruction by an abscess or a stone.
TI  - Host-pathogen interactions in bacterial endocarditis: streptococcal virulence in  the host.
AB  - To identify streptococcal genes that are expressed during experimental endocarditis, we developed a promoter-less dual reporter gene-fusion (amy, cat) plasmid, pAK36. Chromosomal DNA from S. gordonii V288 was digested with Sau3A1. The resulting fragments were ligated into pAK36. Following transformation into S. gordonii, the library of random gene fusion clones was inoculated into a rabbit to induce experimental endocarditis. Chloramphenicol treatment effected positive selection. Upon euthanization of the rabbits, the valvular vegetations were excised in a sterile field. Surviving clones were isolated and screened in vitro for chloramphenicol sensitivity and negative amylase activity. From the 48 randomly picked, double-negative clones, DNA was isolated and analyzed by Southern hybridization with labeled pAK36 probe. Different insertion patterns were identified, suggesting that no fewer than 13 S. gordonii genes were induced. Therefore, S. gordonii genes are induced during experimental endocarditis, which may contribute to virulence.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (1995). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 704 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections (UTIs) in 11 hospitals during the period of June 1995 to May 1996. Of the above bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 29.8% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 70.2% and most of them were Escherichia coli. Susceptibilities of several isolated bacteria to antimicrobial agents were as followed; 1. Enterococcus faecalis Ampicillin (ABPC) and imipenem (IPM) showed the highest activities against E. faecalis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 1 microgram/ml. Vancomycin (VCM) and piperacillin (PIPC) were also active with the MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. The others had low activities with the MIC90S of 16 micrograms/ml or above. 2. Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA VCM showed the highest activities against S. aureus isolated from patients with UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml against both S. aureus and MRSA. Arbekacin (ABK) was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. The other except minocycline (MINO) had very low activities with the MIC90S of 64 micrograms/ml or above. 3. Staphylococcus epidermidis ABK and MINO showed the strongest activities against S. epidermidis isolated from patients with UTIs. The MIC90S of them were 0.25 microgram/ml. VCM was also active with the MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of cephems ranged from 2 micrograms/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they ranged from 8 micrograms/ml to 128 micrograms/ml in 1995. These results indicated that some resistances existed among S. epidermidis to cephems. 4. Streptococcus agalactiae All drugs except gentamicin (GM) were active against S. agalactiae. ABPC, cefmenoxime (CMX), IPM, erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CLDM) and clarithromycin (CAM) showed the highest activities. The MICs for all strains were lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. The MIC90S of the others were 2 micrograms/ml or below. 5. Citrobacter freundii IPM showed the highest activity against C. freundii isolated from patients UTIs. Its MIC90 was 1 microgram/ml. GM was also active with the MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Cefpirome (CPR), cefozopran (CZOP) and amikacin (AMK) were also active with the MIC90S of 4 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CMX, CPR and CZOP showed low activities with MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 6. Enterobacter cloacae IPM showed the highest activity against E. cloacae. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 1 microgram/ml. MINO and tosufloxacin (TFLX) were also active with the MIC90S of 8 micrograms/ml. Penicillins and cephems except CPR and CZOP showed lower activities with the MIC90S of 256 micrograms/ml or above. 7. Escherichia coli. Most of the antimicrobial agents were active against E. coli. Particularly CPR, CZOP and IPM showed the highest activities against E. coli. The MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.5 microgram/ml. CMX and TFLX were also active with the MIC90S of 0.125 microgram/ml or below. Penicillins were slightly active with MIC90S of 128 micrograms/ml or above. 8. Klebsiella pneumoniae K. pneumoniae was susceptible to all drugs except penicillins, with MIC90S of 2 micrograms/ml or below. Carumonam (CRMN) had the strongest activity against K. pneumoniae, the MICs for all strains were equal to or lower than 0.125 microgram/ml. Comparing with the result of 1994, the sensitivities of K. pneumoniae against all drugs had obviously changed into a better state. For example, the MIC90S of cephems ranged from 0.25 microgram/ml to 16 micrograms/ml in 1994, but they were all lower than 2 micrograms/ml in 1995. 9. Proteus mirabilis P. mirabilis was susceptible to a majority of drugs. CMX, ceftazidime (CAZ), cefixime (CFIX), and CRMN showed the highest activities against P. mirabilis isolated from patients with UTIs. MICs of CRMN for all
TI  - Kinetics of specific salivary IgA responses in man after oral challenge by ribosomal immunostimulant.
AB  - The kinetics of specific IgA mucosal responses was assessed in 12 healthy volunteers over 3 weeks of treatment by oral administration of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, composed of ribosomes from the four bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. The levels of IgA specific for these four bacteria increased after each immunization and, after the third week of treatment, were significantly higher than baseline day 0 values. This study demonstrates that oral ribosomal immunostimulation results in the production of specific salivary antibodies liable to recognize whole bacteria antigens, and therefore likely to confer protection. The kinetic analysis performed also demonstrates the rapidity of specific mucosal immune responses after oral stimulation in man, a feature still seldom explored.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance: implications for managing respiratory failure.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in respiratory pathogens is increasing rapidly. In the community, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics has escalated dramatically among Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance to penicillin among S. pneumoniae has developed at an alarming rate over the past two decades. Recent studies in the United States have cited rates of penicillin resistance as high as 23.6%, with 9.5% exhibiting high-level resistance. Many of these strains are resistant to multiple antibiotics. Antimicrobial resistance in hospital-acquired pathogens is a problem, which in large part reflects patterns of antibiotic use. Antimicrobial resistance may arise via multiple mechanisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli have become increasingly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are seen with increasing frequency in Enterobacteriaceae, primarily Klebsiella spp. Fluoroquinolone resistance has increased in P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus and has now been identified in Escherichia coli isolated from hematology wards. Excessive use of antibiotics may promote the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. Rigorous infection control measures and modification of antibiotic use patterns may limit or reduce the prevalence of resistant organisms.
TI  - HIV infection as a risk factor for septic arthritis.
AB  - We prospectively studied the demographics, the clinical and diagnostic features,  the HIV-1 serostatus and the therapeutic response for all new patients with septic arthritis (SA) admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, Rwanda, over a 19 month period. SA was diagnosed in 24 patients (10 male, 14 female), of whom 19 (79%) were HIV-1 seropositive (HIVpos). Gonococcal arthritis was found in four patients, all HIVpos. Non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis was established in 16 patients, of whom 13 were HIVpos. Causative organisms involved in this group and the corresponding HIV-1 serostatus of the patients were: Staphylococcus aureus: 4; 2 HIVpos. 2 HIVneg: Streptococcus pneumoniae: 4; 4 HIVpos; Salmonella group B: 2; 2 HIVpos; Streptococcus group D: 1; 1 HIVpos; Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1; 1 HIVpos; undetermined: 4; 3 HIVpos; 1 HIVneg. Tuberculous arthritis was presumed in four patients, of whom two were HIVpos. HIV-1-associated SA had a classical acute presentation and an overall good prognosis Compared to a control group consisting of hospitalized patients with malaria as the sole diagnosis, patients with SA were more likely to be infected with HIV-1 (P = 0.005, or 6.3; 95% CI 1.7 22.2). Prevalence rate estimates of SA among HIVpos and HIVneg patients were 0.5 and 0.25%, respectively (P = 0.38). We conclude that HIV-1 infection appears as a risk factor for SA among patients hospitalized at the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali, but that SA cannot be used as a predictor for HIV-1 infection for hospitalized patients. SA occurs infrequently and may present at any stage of HIV-1 infection.
TI  - Bacteriology of ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis.
AB  - This study was designed to study the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus in chronic sinusitis with a new sampling method to decrease nasal contamination. The anterior nose was disinfected with povidone-iodine solution. Then, the sample of ethmoid sinus was obtained with a cotton-tip stick through a cannula that was put into the ethmoid cavity after removing ethmoid bulla. Thirty-nine patients of chronic sinusitis were included with a total of 69 specimens. Fifty-eight bacterial isolates were recovered. The cultural rate was 60.9%. The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococcus viridans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus parainfluenzae. Conversely, only three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis were obtained. The results show that the new sampling method used in this study could decrease the chance of nasal contamination and might, at the same time, make the study of the bacteriology of the ethmoid sinus more accurate.
TI  - A national collaborative study of the in vitro activity of oral cephalosporins and loracarbef (LY 163892). Australian Group for the Study of Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR).
AB  - A national collaborative study involving the laboratories of 17 Australian hospitals examined the in vitro activity of loracarbef, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxycillin and amoxycillin/clavulanate against 2661 recently isolated common bacterial pathogens. Loracarbef was the most active agent against Escherichia coli (MIC90 = 1 mg/l) and had activity comparable to other agents against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Like the oral cephalosporins, it had no activity against species of Enterobacter and Serratia. beta-lactamase-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae were moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 8 mg/l for both species). Streptococcus pneumoniae was moderately sensitive to loracarbef (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) but strains which were insensitive to penicillin were often highly resistant.
TI  - Role of coagulase in a murine model of hematogenous pulmonary infection induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads.
AB  - We describe a novel mouse model of acute staphylococcal pneumonia induced by intravenous injection of Staphylococcus aureus enmeshed in agar beads. For comparison, we also used various strains of bacteria, including three strains of S. aureus, two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, three strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae. All except two strains of S. aureus were cleared rapidly from the lungs. When S. aureus NUMR1 enmeshed in agar beads was injected intravenously, the organisms concentrated and remained in the lung for a period longer than several weeks. Multiple lung abscesses were evident macroscopically, and histological examination of the infected lung showed multiple lung abscesses around the pulmonary arterioles, consisting of bacterial colonies encircled with fibrin filaments and surrounded by inflammatory cells of neutrophils and macrophages. When 14 strains of clinically isolated S. aureus were injected intravenously, the number of bacteria recovered from the lung tissue 7 days after infection correlated with the titer of staphylocoagulase (P < 0.01) but not with the titer of clumping factor. Injection of coagulase-deficient mutant strain DU5843 was associated with a markedly reduced number of viable bacteria isolated from the lung, compared with its coagulase-positive parental strain DU5789. Our results suggest that coagulase may play a role in the development of blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in our model. Our animal model is simple and reproducible and resembles blood-borne staphylococcal pneumonia in humans, and it could be useful for investigating the pathogenicity or treatment of staphylococcal pulmonary infection, including infections with methicillin-resistant S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpirome against microorganisms isolated in haematology, oncology and intensive care units in Switzerland.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefpirome, a new parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporin, was investigated in the 5 university hospitals of Switzerland, and compared to 9 other antibiotics mainly used in hospitals, such as ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, piperacillin, imipenem, gentamicin, vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. A total number of 992 strains collected only from intensive care units and haematology-oncology units were tested by microdilution according to NCCLS. Cefpirome showed an excellent activity against all Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 = 4 mg/l), methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC90 = 1 mg/l), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.25 mg/l) and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/l) isolates. Its activity was superior to that of third-generation cephalosporins against cephalosporinase-depressed mutants of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii isolates (MIC90 > 32 mg/l for third-generation cephalosporins vs 4 mg/l for cefpirome). The MICs of cefpirome of 3 strains of Klebsiella spp. with an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase were lower (MIC90 = 2 mg/l) than those of third-generation cephalosporins (MICs90 > 32 mg/l). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa cefpirome was as active as ceftazidime. The activity of cefpirome was poor against methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and nosocomial Gram-negative bacteria such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - [Community-acquired pneumonia: Etiological diagnosis].
AB  - Microbiological and immunoserological approaches were used in etiological diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. It was concluded that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae predominated in the etiological structure of present severe community-acquired pneumonia. The most actual causative agents of nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons under 60 were S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. Nonsevere community-acquired pneumonia in persons over 60 and/ or at the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus or other affections was most frequently due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and aerobic gramnegative microbes.
TI  - Effectiveness of ribosomal fractions of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and the membrane fraction of Kp (Ribomunyl) in the prevention of clinical recurrences of infectious rhinitis. Results of a multicenter double-blind placebo-controlled study.
AB  - A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of an immunostimulant, Ribomunyl, in the prevention of recurrences of infectious rhinitis in adults. This trial involved 327 patients (168 Ribomunyl treated and 159 placebo cases) with an average of 4.3 +/- 1.8 rhinitis episodes per patient recorded during the year preceding the study. The main criterion of efficacy was the cumulative number of recurrences of infectious rhinitis during a 6-month follow-up period, as analyzed by standard tests. An additional analysis of relative risk of recurrences used multivariate failure for time data. Ribomunyl was effective throughout the study period, starting from the first month of treatment: a mean of 1.0 +/- 1.1 recurrences was recorded in the Ribomunyl group as compared to 1.5 +/- 1.4 recurrences in the placebo group; this indicated one-third fewer infections (P = 0.001). The protective effect of Ribomunyl on the relative risk for recurrences was estimated to be 0.58 by multivariate analysis (95% CI: 0.43-0.78, P = 0.0001). Analysis of secondary criteria also favored Ribomunyl: 38.5% less antibiotic courses per patient (0.8 +/- 1.3 vs 1.3 +/- 1.6; P = 0.002) and the number of days with antibiotics (5.6 +/- 9.3 vs 9.1 +/- 12.1; P = 0.002).
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in Harare, Zimbabwe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV infection is common in mothers and their children in Zimbabwe, and HIV-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. There is little information on the etiology and outcome of HIV-related bacteremia in African children. METHODS: Blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in Zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having HIV, were examined for pathogens. The association among significant bacteremia, HIV infection and mortality was assessed in these children. RESULTS: The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), Staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). Nontyphoidal Salmonella (10 children), Escherichia coli (4 children) and Klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent Gram-negative bacteria. Two children had Rhodococcus equi pneumonia. HIV-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (OR) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (OR = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (OR = 15.76). There was no significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. Mortality was 17% overall but was higher in HIV-infected children up to 6 months of age (OR = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (OR = 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: Prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in HIV-infected children in Africa.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in India and the United States.
AB  
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of ceftriaxone and gentamicin alone and in combination on Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus viridans.
AB  - A persistent suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to an antimicrobial agent, the postantibiotic effect (PAE), has been described for a variety of antibiotics and microorganisms. In this study the PAE of ceftriaxone and gentamicin was determined in vitro on three strains each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus viridans. The strains were exposed to the substances for 2 h at varying concentrations. Ceftriaxone was used at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 1/2 MIC and gentamicin at 1/2 MIC, 1/4 MIC, and 1/8 MIC, each alone and in combination. Antibiotic concentrations were reduced by 1,000-fold dilution, bacterial regrowth was consequently monitored by viable count. The PAE of ceftriaxone alone reached up to 145 min (MIC) and 50 min (1/2 MIC), that of gentamicin alone up to 170 min (1/2 MIC), 135 min (1/4 MIC) and 70 min (1/8 MIC), depending on the bacterial species. Combinations of the antibiotics produced longer PAEs than one substance alone; the longest PAE was produced by the combination of ceftriaxone (MIC) and gentamicin (1/2 MIC) lasting up to 320 min (S. viridans). It may be important to take the PAE into account when evaluating dosing intervals.
TI  - [The evaluation of cefmetazole in clinical use. The study group of cefmetazole in clinical use].
AB  - To study the clinical effect of cefmetazole (CMZ), we treated with CMZ 1,926 patients with various infections involving the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver and biliary tract, skin and soft tissue and others. The marked effect rate was 56.5%, and the effect rate 33.7%. The sensitivity test of CMZ was also performed in vitro. Staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus, staphylococcus epidermis, E. coli, S. typhi, B. salmonella, B. shigella, B. Klebsiella pneumoniae, B. proteus, etc. were sensitive to CMZ. Injecting CMZ can prevent the infection of operation. The study of the adverse reaction of CMZ showed, an adverse reaction rate of 4.2% (the gastrointestinal tract, allergy, kidney and nervous system). These results suggested that CMZ is an antibiotic of broad spectrum, high efficacy and low toxicity. It is effective in treating sensitive bacterial infection, unknown pathogenic infection and mixed bacterial infection, and preventing infection in surgery.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CDZM and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in our laboratory from September to December of 1992 and from September to December of 1995. The results are summarized as follows: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter koseri, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The range of MIC values of CDZM against Klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. Other strains, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including CDZM. 2. The MIC90's of CDZM were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae, M. (B.) catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, N. gonorrhoeae and Peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently found in daily treatment of infections. It appears that the effectiveness of CDZM was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. Among H. influenzae isolates included imipenem (IPM)-resistant and norfloxacin (NFLX)-resistant strains. The MIC-range of CDZM against strains collected in 1995 including IPM-resistant and NFLX-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and MIC90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. CDZM showed strong antimicrobial activities against H. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.
TI  - A multinational European survey on the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin and other  comparative antibiotics on respiratory and urinary bacterial pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of rufloxacin was confirmed against a large number of  respiratory and urinary tract pathogens collected in five European countries. In terms of both MIC90 values and percentages of susceptible isolates found, this new quinolone showed useful in-vitro activity against Mycoplasma catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a large proportion of Staphylococcus aureus also covered, while, as expected Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were not included in its antibacterial spectrum. Rufloxacin was comparable with the other antibiotics against these pathogens with the exception of streptococci. Against these microorganisms, beta-lactams were the most active agents. Against the urinary pathogens the in-vitro activity of rufloxacin is similar to that of norfloxacin although this latter drug is more active in terms of MIC90 values and in percentages of strains inhibited. In many cases more isolates were susceptible to the remaining comparator agents than to rufloxacin. However, there were no significant differences between the numbers of microorganisms inhibited by the various drugs and rufloxacin. The findings of this survey do not seem to modify the general picture which emerged in previous studies and further confirms its useful spectrum in different geographic settings.
TI  - Pediatric meningitis in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.
AB  - During the 9 years 1985-1993 a prospective survey of all cases of meningitis in children < 13 years of age presenting to our hospital in the Western Cape Province of South Africa was carried out. Two-thousand-nine-hundred-and-twenty cases of meningitis were identified. The commonest form of bacterial meningitis was tuberculous meningitis (TBM) diagnosed in 282 children (mean age 2.94 years). N. meningitidis identified in 220 children (mean age 2.87 years), Haemophilus influenzae in 156 children (mean age 1.15 years) and S. pneumoniae in 106 children (mean age 2.14) were the next commonest causes of bacterial meningitis diagnosed. One-hundred-and-eighteen cases of bacterial meningitis were confirmed in infants < 1 month of age and the commonest bacteria identified were group B beta-haemolytic Streptococcus in 27, E. coli in 21, Klebsiella species in 11, and Candida species in 15 neonates. The emergence of TBM as the predominant cause of bacterial meningitis in childhood at our hospital is probably a reflection of the worsening tuberculosis situation in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.
TI  - Cytotoxic and antibacterial activities of sesquiterpene lactones isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum.
AB  - Ten sesquiterpene lactones and one sesquiterpene isolated from Tanacetum praeteritum subsp. praeteritum: 1 alpha, 6 alpha -dihydroxyisocostic acid methyl ester (2), 1 alpha-hydroxy-1-deoxoarglanine (3), douglanin (5), santamarin (6), reynosin (7), 1-epitatridin B (8), ludovicin A (10), armexin (12), armefolin (13), armexifolin (14), and 3 alpha-hydroxyreynosin (15) were tested against the human lung carcinoma cell line GLC4 and the colorectal cancer cell line COLO 320 as well as against the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and the yeast Candida albicans. In addition, two germacranolides tatridin A (16) and tamirin (17) were included in the study. All compounds showed cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 124 microM) but most of them were not effective in the antimicrobial tests.
TI  - [HIV infection and splenectomy: 3 cases and literature review].
AB  - 3 splenectomized patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are  described. They all presented with more than 500 CD4/mm3 but, surprisingly, with a CD4 percentage below 15, positive p24 antigenemia and a CD4/CD8 ratio below 0.24. 2 patients had repeated episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis while their CD4 counts exceeded 800/mm3. These episodes suggested the presence of a certain degree of immuno-suppression and prompted us to introduce anti-HIV therapy. 2 patients also presented with a pulmonary infection, due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae respectively. The third patient had septicemia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 22, despite vaccination and a CD4 count above 700/mm3. In splenectomized HIV-infected patients the number of CD4 lymphocytes should be interpreted with caution, as this number increases after splenectomy. The CD4 percentage and CD4/CD8 ratio correlated better with the clinical stage of HIV infection and gave more valuable indications as to the degree of immunosuppression. A possible correlation between viremia and the number of CD4 lymphocytes in this subset of patients remains to be established. In HIV-infected patients, infections due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus and enteric gram-negative bacteria are frequent. After splenectomy, susceptibility to encapsulated bacteria increases even in HIV-negative patients. Early vaccination against the main strains of S. pneumoniae is essential, as vaccinal response is uncertain in patients with less than 400 CD4/mm3.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. Special references to bacteria isolated between July 1994 and June 1995].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from July  1994 to June 1995 were investigated by a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. One hundred and fifty-three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 143 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, both anaerobic Gram-positive and-negative bacteria were predominant, and from postoperative infections, aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus faecalis was highest, followed by that of Staphylococcus aureus from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Streptococcus intermedius was highest from primary infections, but from postoperative infections anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria was uncommon. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order. From postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by Serratia marcescens and E. coli. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. We have noticed that resistant strains against imipenem and ofloxacin were increasing among P. aeruginosa and resistant strains against cefazolin were increasing among E. coli. MICs of cefazolin against four out of 30 strains of E. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and MICs of imipenem was higher than 50 micrograms/ml against 5 out of 22 strains of P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Severe community-acquired pneumonia in Singapore.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been no previous study documenting the aetiology and prognosis of severe community-acquired pneumonia in Singapore. Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia (SCAP) needing admission to a medical intensive care unit in Singapore were studied retrospectively. METHODS: All patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit at National University Hospital from June 1991 to February 1993 with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia were entered into the study. All patients had blood cultures, sputum cultures, serologies for Legionella and mycoplasma drawn on admission. APACHE II scores were determined prospectively. RESULTS: Fifty-nine consecutive cases from June 1991 to February 1993 were identified with a mean age of 61 (SD 17) years. Nearly all the cases needed mechanical ventilation (90%) and overall mortality was 63%. An aetiological agent was identified in the majority of cases (68%), with Klebsiella pneumoniae being the most common agent (9 cases, 15%). Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae were identified in 8% (5 cases) and 5% (3 cases) of cases respectively. Pseudomonas pseudomallei was identified in 4 cases (7%) with a 100% mortality. Overall, gram-negative organisms were identified in 47% of cases. APACHE II was significantly higher in non-survivors. Age, creatinine levels, and the presence of bacteraemia were not prognostic features. CONCLUSION: SCAP in Singapore carries a high mortality with the predominance of gram-negative organisms. Empiric antibiotics should include gram-positive and gram-negative coverage with specific coverage for Pseudomonas pseudomallei.

TI  - [Study on septicaemia in infants and children in the past 20 years. Part 1. An analysis of causal organisms].
AB  - Causal organisms and their changes were evaluated in 158 cases of septicaemia admitted to Jikei University Hospital from 1975 to 1994. Eighty patients (50.6%) were aged less than 1 year, and 37 patients (23.4%) were newborns. The average mortality rate was 18.4%. The mortality rate between 1975 and 1984 was 26.8%, and that of the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994) decreased to 13.7%. Staphylococcus aureus (29 cases, 19.4%) was the most common pathogens isolated, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (24 cases, 15.2%), Escherichia coli (19 cases, 12.0%), and Haemophilus influenzae (18 cases, 11.4%). H. influenzae, Acinetobacter sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus (GBS) increased in the past 10 years (from 1985 to 1994), compared with the preceding 10 years (from 1975 to 1984). The mortality rate of Klebsiella sp. septicaemia (28.6%) was highest, followed by Pseudomonas sp. (25.0%), S. aureus (24.1%), S. pneumoniae (22.2%). H. influenzae and Acinetobacter sp. septicaemia were not fatal. E. coli and GBS were common among neonates and patients aged less than 1 year. H. influenzae septicaemia occurred mainly in patients with meningitis, in those younger than school age. Acinetobacter sp. was common among neonates and children with leukaemia Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., and Acinetobacter sp. were mainly detected in patients with underlying diseases. E. coli, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and GBS were mainly detected in patients without underlying diseases.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LB10522, a new catecholic cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro activity of LB10522 was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefoperazone against clinical isolates. Against gram-positive bacteria, LB10522 was most active among the compounds tested. It was fourfold more active than cefpirome against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. LB10522 was highly effective against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested. Ninety percent of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella spp. were inhibited at a concentration of < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml. These activities were comparable to those of cefpirome. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LB10522 with a MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited of 2 micrograms/ml was 16- and 32-fold more active than ceftazidime and ceftazidime against systemic infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus giorgio, Streptococcus pneumoniae III, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E, Escherichia coli 851E, Proteus mirabilis 1315E, Serratia marcescens 1826E, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus Ac-54. LB10522 was very resistant to hydrolysis by various beta-lactamases such as TEM-3, TEM-7, SHV-1, FEC-1, and P-99. LB10522 did not induce beta-lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae 1194E, although most of the reference cephalosporins acted as inducers of beta-lactamase in this strain. Time-kill study showed that LB10522, at concentrations of two or four times the MIC, had a rapid bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus 6538p, Escherichia coli 851E, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 1912E.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich peptide derived from a  putative porcine precursor protein of a novel family of antibacterial peptides.
AB  - It has long been speculated that porcine cathelin is an N-terminal fragment of a  longer precursor protein which possesses antimicrobial activity. In an attempt to find such a precursor, a cDNA clone was recently isolated and sequenced by screening a cDNA library from porcine bone marrow. In order to identify the functional activity of the putative protein encoded by an open reading frame, we have synthesized various lengths of peptides that correspond to the C-terminal region of the protein and examined them for their antimicrobial activities. We found that a 13 amino acid tryptophan-rich region with the sequence of VRRFPWWWPFLRR had strong antimicrobial activity with a wide spectrum. It showed potency against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D as well as Aspergillus fumigatus. The action of this peptide is bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic and this activity is completely inhibited by 2 mM MgCl2. Our results indicate that the previously identified putative precursor encoded by the isolated cDNA indeed possesses a potent antimicrobial activity and that this 13 amino acid synthetic peptide is considered to be a potentially effective drug against various infectious agents.
TI  - A multicentre collaborative study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of community-acquired, lower respiratory tract pathogens 1992-1993: the Alexander Project.
AB  - The Alexander Project is a unique, international, collaborative antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study of bacterial pathogens causing community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. Fifteen centres, ten in the European Union (EU) and five in the USA, each submitted up to 400 isolated per year for 2 years (1992 and 1993) to a central laboratory for re-identification and determination of MICs of 15 antimicrobials using the Sensititre microbroth incorporation technique. Of the total of 6385 isolates collected, Haemophilus influenzae (2718), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1856) and Moraxella catarrhalis (818) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus (690). Haemophilus parainfluenzae (183) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (120) were identified less commonly. High-level penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) was found in 222 isolates, an overall prevalence of 12% which varied from < 1% in Germany, Italy, UK and two of the five USA centres, to 3.8-40.4% in the remainder, with the highest prevalence found in France and Spain. Intermediate penicillin resistance (MIC 0.12-1 mg/L) was identified in 228 isolates of S. pneumoniae, an overall prevalence of 12.3%, with individual centre prevalence varying widely (EU, 0-52.3%; USA, 0-20.9%) and not always following that of high-level resistance. Resistance to other, unrelated, antimicrobials, except notably the fluoroquinolones, was strongly associated with beta-lactam resistance. beta-lactamase production was detected in 492 isolates of H. influenzae, an overall prevalence of 18.1%. Rates of detection varied widely between centres from 1.4% in Weingarten, Germany in 1993 to 38.5% in Barcelona, Spain in 1992. In general, the prevalence of beta-lactamase production was higher and less variable in USA centres than in those of the EU. beta-Lactamase was detected consistently in the majority of isolates of M. catarrhalis with an overall prevalence of 81.7%. Virtually no other resistance phenotype was recognised in this species. Of the 690 collected, most isolates of S. aureus produced beta-lactamase with rates of detection varying from 52.2%-89.1%. Isolates from two centres, Genoa, Italy in 1992 and Paris, France in 1993, were associated with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistance (34.8% and 43.8%, respectively). Combined isolates of H. parainfluenzae and K. pneumoniae accounted for only 4.7% of the total collection. Although the current data are insufficient to allow analysis of trends in resistance, the study participants have continued to collect further isolates in 1994 and 1995 which will be reported in the future.
TI  - [Prospective study of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among patients in a general hospital].
AB  - We prospectively studied the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia among all patients who were admitted to our hospital from July 1994 to June 1995. Tests for microbial pathogens including Chlamydia spp. and Legionella spp. were performed and diagnoses were made with strict criteria. A total 110 patients with 111 episodes of pneumonia were evaluated, and a pathogen was identified in 61 episodes (55%). The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae (18%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia spp. Infection with Legionella pneumophila was not found. Dual pathogens were identified in five episodes. Few prospective studies of the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia have been done in Japan. To prepare guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan, a national study of the etiology of pneumonia is necessary.
TI  - Clinical applications of a new parenteral antibiotic in the treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Cephalosporins are one of the mainstays of antibiotic therapy, and third-generation cephalosporins are first-line agents for the treatment of many types of serious infections, including those of nosocomial origin. Gaps in activity of currently available third-generation cephalosporins such as cefotaxime, cefoperazone, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, and increasing reports of gram-negative bacilli resistance to some of these agents, especially Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., make it necessary to investigate new compounds. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a wide range of activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multi-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, was evaluated in comparison with ceftazidime for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Ceftazidime is a commonly prescribed third-generation cephalosporin used for empiric treatment of serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin and skin-structure infection. This investigation was an open, randomized comparative study involving 882 patients in North America. Cefepime 2 g every 12 hours demonstrated similar efficacy to that of ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infection (including cases associated with concurrent bacteremia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The bacteriologic responses were generally >85%. The most common pathogens isolated were Escherichia coll, Streptococcus pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus, group B. Overall, approximately 94% of pathogens isolated in pretreatment cultures were susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. Cefepime and ceftazidime were well tolerated; only 3% of patients in each group discontinued therapy because of an adverse event. The most common adverse events were headache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and rash. The results of this study indicate that cefepime is a promising, effective, and safe single-agent therapy for serious infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Impact of changing pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The selection of drug-resistant pathogens in hospitalized patients with serious infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections (UTI), skin and skin-structure infections, and primary or secondary bacteremia has generally been ascribed to the widespread use of antimicrobial agents. Issues of concern regarding gram-negative bacilli include the expression of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonias and constitutive resistance in some Enterobacteriaceae caused by Bush group 1 beta-lactamases. Current concerns with gram-positive pathogens are increasing multidrug resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing incidence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Contemporary treatment strategies for pneumonia in hospitalized patients mandate early empiric therapy for the most likely gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Newer beta-lactams, such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, may be useful in the treatment of pneumonia, including those cases associated with bacteremia. Combination beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor drugs, an aminoglycoside co-drug, or a carbapenem may also be indicated. The initial treatment of UTI in the hospital setting also may be empirically treated with the newer cephalosporins, combination broad-spectrum penicillins plus an aminoglycoside, a quinolone, or a carbapenem. Current problems in treating UTI include the emergence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, the tendency of fluoroquinolones both to select for resistant strains of major UTI pathogens and to induce cross-resistance among different drug classes, and beta-lactam and vancomycin resistance of enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Treatment of skin and skin-structure infections is complicated by the coexistence of gram-positive and gram-negative infections, which may be drug resistant. Both fourth-generation beta-lactams and carbapenems may have in vitro activity against these pathogens; however, where these drugs--with their increased spectra and lower affinity for beta-lactamases and less susceptibility to beta-lactamase hydrolysis--fit into the therapeutic armamentarium remains to be determined. Initial clinical studies appear to be promising, nonetheless. The ability of both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to develop resistance to powerful broad-spectrum agents presents a great challenge for prescribing patterns and in the development of new drugs to be relatively resistant to inactivation.
TI  - Evaluation of the use of Bactec anaerobic blood cultures in the detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children.
AB  - In an attempt to reduce costs, the role of Bactec anaerobic blood culture in the  detection of bacteraemia and fungaemia in children was evaluated. Results from 3167 sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures from children admitted to the University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur during a one year period, were analysed. Four hundred and eight (12.9%) sets of blood cultures were positive, of which 348 sets (11.0%) from 201 patients were clinically significant. Of the 348 significant positive sets, organisms were isolated on 177 (50.9%) occasions from both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, on 136 (39.1%) occasions from the aerobic bottle only and 35 (10.0%) occasions from the anaerobic bottle only. No strict anaerobes were isolated, but clinically significant isolates recovered from the anaerobic bottle only included Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella species, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Group B streptococcus. Patients with bacteraemia diagnosed solely by anaerobic culture were distributed evenly across the various paediatric subspecialities. When results from the anaerobic bottles were excluded, the overall isolation rate was reduced from 11% to 9.9%. Potential financial savings resulting from omission of anaerobic cultures must be balanced against the small number of bacteraemic episodes that could be missed. Undiagnosed bacteraemia may result in increased morbidity and mortality with its own attendant financial implications.
TI  - Brodimoprim: effects of subminimal inhibitory concentrations on virulence traits  of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, and on plasmid transfer and stability.
AB  - The effects of brodimoprim, a new trimethoprim analogue, on several virulence traits of respiratory and urinary tract pathogens exposed to sub-lethal levels of the drug was studied. Adherence to tracheal epithelial cells was inhibited by brodimoprim in Klebsiella pneumoniae (41-67% reduction), Moraxella catarrhalis (87-90%) and Haemophilus influenzae (0-53%), while in Streptococcus pneumoniae binding was unaffected. With buccal epithelial cells the comparison between treated and control bacteria indicated statistically significant reduction in adherence with both S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae, (P < 0.015). With M.catarrhalis and Streptococcus pyogenes only marginal changes were detected (P > 0.05). Exoenzyme and capsule production were assessed in at least three isolates of diverse respiratory pathogens grown in the presence of sub-lethal levels of the new agent. The drug affected protease and beta-hemolysin (alpha-toxin) production in both oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S.aureus. On the contrary, synthesis of lipase, DNase, coagulase, and beta-lactamase (S.aureus), pneumolysin (S.pneumoniae), streptolysin S, DNase, and protease (S.pyogenes), capsule (K.pneumoniae, H.influenzae and S.pneumoniae), and beta-lactamase (K.pneumoniae, H.influenzae and M.catarrhalis) were not inhibited by subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of the drug. Finally, motility was blocked in urinary pathogens E.coli, P.mirabilis and P.aeruginosa, while in this latter microorganism pigment production was also affected. High molecular weight low-copy F'lac, and low molecular weight high-copy pHSG298 plasmids were eliminated from E.coli treated with sub-MIC concentrations of brodimoprim. The incidence and cured cells ranged from 9% for F'lac to 23% for pHSG298. F'lac transfer was also inhibited by the drug. When conjugation was carried out with bacteria exposed to brodimoprim (5XMIC), a reduction (50%) in the number of recombinants was noted in comparison to the control. The fact that brodimoprim interferes with the expression of some virulence traits, in particular with adherence, at sub-MIC levels may assist the drug in eradicating respiratory pathogens from the epithelial lining, thus diminishing the probability of reinfection.
TI  - A study of the influence of biphase calcium phosphate ceramics on bacterial strains: in vitro approach.
AB  - An in vitro study of the influence of Biphase Calcium Phosphate Ceramics (BCPCs)  on bacterial strains is presented. The test procedures were carried out in saline test solution to which different quantities (2,4,50,100, and 200 mg) of BCPCs(samples A and B) were added. The influence of BCPCs on standard bacterial strains has been determined by measuring bacterial contamination using the plate count method. The testing method was validated with membrane filtration and direct inoculation in culture media of sediment and supernatant. The test demonstrated reduction of the bacterial cell population in from 1 to 24 h in all experiments. The antibacterial effect revealed the specific inherent properties of the BCPCs under investigation.
TI  - Escherichia coli lobar pneumonia: fatal infection in a patient with mental retardation.
AB  - Lobar pneumonia due to Escherichia coli is rare. Most lobar pneumonias are caused by either Streptococcus pneumoniae or Klebsiella pneumoniae, and most E coli pneumonias are bronchopneumonias. We report an acute fulminant course of E coli lobar pneumonia in a 37-year-old patient who was profoundly retarded, institutionalized, and nonimmunosuppressed and who died within 2 days of developing initial symptoms. Antemortem blood and postmortem blood and lung specimens isolated pure cultures of E coli. The source of infection in E coli lobar pneumonia is not clear in this patient or in the few cases that have been reported. We postulate that nasopharyngeal colonization of E coli in those who are institutionalized with mental retardation may predispose these patients to E coli pneumonia. Our case illustrates features of pneumonias that are unique in the institutionalized, mentally retarded patient population (ie, the relatively high prevalence of nasopharyngeal colonization of E coli, a higher incidence of E coli pneumonia than in other institutionalized populations, the often fulminant course of the disease), as well as the need for early, aggressive treatment including antibiotics effective against gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Increased plasma adenosine deaminase activity in the early phase of Legionella pneumophila infection in guinea pigs.
AB  - We measured adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in a guinea pig model of Legionella pneumophila infection. Female Hartley guinea pigs were inoculated intraperitoneally with one-quarter of the LD50 dose of L. pneumophila Philadelphia-1 strain. Control groups were inoculated with clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Each group consisted of 5 animals. ADA activity in plasma was assayed calorimetrically before and at various intervals after infection by measuring the amount of ammonia produced after adenosine was added to plasma samples. ADA activity before inoculation was 25.6 +/- 6.0 IU/1, it reached 174.4 +/- 60.0 IU/1 on day 3 after inoculation of L. pneumophila. ADA activity returned to normal levels on day 14. ADA activity did not increase significantly in guinea pigs infected with the other types of bacteria. These findings suggest that measurement of plasma ADA activity may be useful for the diagnosis of Legionella infection.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1994)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981. IKEMOTO et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of these isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and characteristics of the patients and isolates from them each year. Results obtained from these investigations are discussed. In 23 institutions around the entire Japan, 492 strains of presumably etiological bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputum of 421 patients with lower respiratory tract infections from October 1994 to September 1995. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 70 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 101 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 92 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 61 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains), 25 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid strains), 48 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 14 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were assessed except for those strains that died during transportation. 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of oxacillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 51.4%, but the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria decreased comparing to the previous year's 56.0%. Vancomycin showed the highest activity against S. aureus with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae. Most of the drugs tested showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem of carbapenems showed the most potent activity with MIC80 was 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and clindamycin showed low activities with MIC80s > or = 256 micrograms/ml. Among these strains, however, 46.5% and 68.3% of strains, were quite sensitive toward these agents, respectively, with MICs of 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae. The activities of all drugs were potent against H. influenzae tested. Cefmenoxime a cephem, showed the most potent activity, the MICs of this drug against all of the 92 strains were 0.063 microgram/ml. Ofloxacin also showed a potent activity, and inhibited about 96% of strains with MIC of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 0.5 microgram/ml. Gentamicin, arbekacin and ciprofloxacin showed next potent activities, and their MIC80s were 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to the activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid strains), the activities of all the drugs tested were lower against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid strains). 6. K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity against K. pneumoniae with MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml. Cefozopran showed the next most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.125 microgram/ml. Ampicillin and cephems except cefpodoxime, cefozopran and cefditoren showed low activities and their MIC80s were > or = 16 micrograms/ml, and their MICs were all higher than > or = 4 micrograms/ml. 7. M. (B.) catarrhalis. Imipenem and ofloxacin showed the most potent activities against M. (B.) catarrhalis, their MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. Erythromycin and minocycline showed the next highest activities with their MIC80s at 0.25 microgram/ml. Also, we investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, the respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiology of bacteria. Patients characteristics, in this period of investigation showed varieties of infectious diseases found in patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 62.0% of all the cases. Different lower respiratory tract infectious were distributed as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest number of cases with 35.6%, 27.1%, respectively, followed by
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against pathogens associated with community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias.
AB  - The serum bactericidal activities of ceftizoxime and ceftriaxone against organisms commonly implicated in community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonias were studied. Ceftizoxime 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 12 hours for two doses and ceftriaxone 1 g (as the sodium salt) every 24 hours for two doses were administered to 20 healthy volunteers in a crossover fashion. Blood samples were drawn immediately before and 2,4,6,8,10, and 12 hours after the second ceftizoxime dose and immediately before and 8,12,16,18,20, and 24 hours after the second ceftriaxone dose. Serum drug concentrations were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal titers were determined in duplicate for each serum sample against four clinical isolates of each of the following organisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. The median duration of serum bactericidal activity during the dosage interval was significantly different between antimicrobial regimens only for S. pneumoniae (92% of the dosage interval for ceftizoxime, versus 100% for ceftriaxone). This difference does not appear to be clinically important since ceftizoxime provides adequate serum bactericidal activity for more than 50% of the dosage interval and its effectiveness against pneumococcal pneumonia has been supported in clinical trials. The ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime regimens did not differ significantly in their duration of serum bactericidal activity against six of the seven organisms tested.
TI  - An evaluation of the in vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  - Tazobactam is a new, irreversible inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamases of staphylococci, plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of the TEM and SHV types found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and beta-lactamases of anerobes such as Bacteroides species. Its combination with piperacillin, a broad spectrum ureido-penicillin, would be expected to improve the activity of piperacillin against staphylococci, TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing Gram negative bacteria and anerobes. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of piperacillin/tazobactam were determined for 1952 individual patient isolates of Gram positive and negative bacteria causing significant infections and compared with MIC values for cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, ticarcillin/clavulanic acid. MICs were determined by agar dilution (NCCLS 1990 and 1992). Piperacillin/tazobactam had excellent activity against methicillin susceptible staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, enterococci and organisms of the Bacteroides fragilis group. It was also active against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates tested. It was not active against extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species and some high level TEM and SHV beta-lactamase producing E. coli and Klebsiella species. Activity against Gram negative organisms capable of producing chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases was good, since in most organisms tested, the enzymes were not induced in sufficient quantities to cause antibiotic resistance. However some Enterobacter species were derepressed hyperproducing mutants; these isolates showed resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam since tazobactam does not inhibit these Class I beta lactamases. Activity was superior to ticarcillin/clavulanic acid for Gram negative rods. Imipenem was the most active agent against ESBL producing Klebsiella species. Piperacillin/tazobactam has a suitable spectrum of activity in vitro to suggest its use in monotherapy of mixed anerobic infections, mixed respiratory infections such as aspiration pneumonia and, in combination with an aminoglycoside, it would provide Gram positive as well as Gram negative cover of febrile episodes in immunosuppressed patients.
TI  - An abietane diterpene and two phenolics from Salvia forskahlei.
AB  - From the roots of Salvia forskahlei a new diterpenoid, forskalinone, two new aromatic compounds, the octanol esters of cis- and trans-4-O-methyl-caffeic acid dimers, were isolated together with the known compounds stigmast-3-one, sitosterol and alpha-amyrin. The structures of the new and the known compounds were established by spectral data. The antimicrobial activity of forskalinone and the dimeric cinnamic acid esters was tested against standard bacterial strains and a yeast, namely Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Staphylococcus aureus 6538P, S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 14153, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Klebsiella pneumonia ATC 4352, Pseudomonus aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, beta-haemolytic Streptococcus and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Forskalinone showed moderate resistance against S. epidermidis (670 micrograms ml-1) and slight activity against E. faecalis (168 micrograms ml-1). trans-4-O-Methyl-caffeic acid dimer octanol ester was inactive while the cis isomer showed a slight activity against C. albicans (156 micrograms ml-1).
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo activities of CS-940, a new 6-fluoro-8-difluoromethoxy quinolone, were compared with those of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin. The in vitro activity of CS-940 against gram-positive bacteria was nearly equal to or greater than those of the other quinolones tested. In particular, CS-940 was two to eight times more active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus than the other quinolones, at the MIC at which 90% of the clinical isolates are inhibited. Against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of CS-940 was comparable to or greater than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin, while it was lower than that of ciprofloxacin. The activity of CS-940 was largely unaffected by medium, inoculum size, or the addition of horse serum, but it was decreased under acidic conditions, as was also seen with the other quinolones tested. CS-940 showed potent bactericidal activity against S. aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In oral treatment of mouse systemic infections caused by S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa, CS-940 was more effective than ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin against all strains tested. Against experimental pneumonia with K. pneumoniae in mice, CS-940 was the most effective of all the quinolones tested. These results suggest that CS-940 may be effective in the therapy of various bacterial infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of l-ofloxacin and FK037 to other agents against 10,040 fresh clinical isolates.
AB  - Fresh clinical isolates collected from November 1, 1992 through November 1, 1993, were tested by agar dilution against 26 different antimicrobial agents including FK037 and l-ofloxacin. Among the 10 040 organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1222), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 455), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 533), Staphylococcus hominis (n = 90), Staphylococcus hemolyticus (n = 89), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 144), Escherichia coli (n = 2326), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 745), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 258), Proteus mirabilis (n = 445), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 998), and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (n = 102). Both l-ofloxacin and FK037 inhibited 98% of S. aureus strains at 4 mug/ml. FK037 was at least 4 times more effective than the third generation cephalosporins against MRSA, inhibiting 79% of the strains at 16 mug/ml. While the potency of these agents looks promising, their clinical utility will depend in part upon the maximal dosage that can be safely administered.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem antibiotic].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem, a new penem, were evaluated in comparison with imipenem (IPM), meropenem (MEPM), ceftazidime (CAZ) and flomoxef (FMOX). Sulopenem had broad and potent antibacterial spectra against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii. Sulopenem showed concentration-dependent bactericidal activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Morphological observation using phase-contrast microscope revealed that sulopenem induced spherical cell formation with E. coli and K. pneumoniae at lower concentrations and bacteriolysis at higher concentrations. Therapeutic efficacies of sulopenem against systemic infections in mice were almost equal to those of imipenem against Streptococcus pneumoniae. While its therapeutic efficacies were superior to those of meropenem, ceftazidime and flomoxef against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, they were inferior to those of imipenem/cilastatin against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and A. calcoaceticus.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - [In vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (CP-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (IPM), flomoxef, cefuzonam (CZON) and cefotaxime. Sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. Antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of IPM. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. In a killing kinetics study for Haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. This effect was obtained at a concentration 8-fold lower than that of IPM. The protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. In murine experimental mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ED50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than IPM. The therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its MIC value. In guinea pigs experimental lung infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than CZON or cefotiam.
TI  - Polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  - The polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (UP-PCR) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. A universal protocol of preparation of PCR samples from cultures representing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. The bands of UP-PCR products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. The applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the DNA bands obtained for different strains. Three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis produced very similar DNA banding patterns. They comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. The DNA profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. The method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial empyema in cirrhotic patients: a prospective study.
AB  - Spontaneous bacterial empyema (SBEM) is an infection of a preexisting hydrothorax in cirrhotic patients and has seldom been reported. To determine its incidence and primary characteristics, all cirrhotic patients with pleural effusion underwent thoracentesis at our hospital either on admission or when an infection was suspected. Pleural fluid (PF) study included biochemical analysis, polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocyte count, and culture by two methods: conventional and modified (inoculation of 10 mL of PF into a blood culture bottle at the bedside). SBEM was defined according to previously reported criteria: PF culture positive or PMN count greater than 500 cells/micro L, and exclusion of parapneumonic effusions. Sixteen of the 120 (13 percent) cirrhotic patients admitted with hydrothorax had 24 episodes of SBEM. In 10 of the 24 episodes (43 percent), SBEM was not associated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). PF culture was positive by the conventional method in 8 episodes (33 percent) and by the modified method (blood culture inoculation) in 18 (75 percent) (P = .004, McNemar). The microorganisms identified in PF were Escherichia coli in 8 episodes, Streptococcus species in 4, Enterococcus species in 3, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, and Pseudomonas stutzeri in 1. All episodes were treated with antibiotics without inserting a chest tube in any case. Mortality during treatment was 20 percent. We conclude that SBEM is a common complication of cirrhotic patients with hydrothorax. Almost half of the episodes were not associated with SBP; thus, thoracentesis should be performed in patients with cirrhosis, pleural effusion, and suspected infection. Culture of PF should be performed by inoculating 10 mL into a blood culture bottle at the bedside.
TI  - In-vitro interaction of azithromycin and fluoroquinolones against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the combined in-vitro effects of azithromycin plus the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin or lomefloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Fractional inhibitory (FIC) and fractional bactericidal concentration indices of azithromycin and the fluoroquinolone were determined using a microtiter-checkerboard method. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, Xanthomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus were studied. Fourteen strains of S. aureus were also studied in time-kill curves with azithromycin (4 mg/L), lomefloxacin (6 mg/L) and the two in combination. RESULTS: No synergism or antagonism was found in inhibitory assays. However, bactericidal assays revealed antagonism with some strains of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, X. maltophilia, A. calcoaceticus, P. aeruginosa, P. cepacia, K. pneumoniae and E. coli. Kill-curve results with 14 strains of S. aureus showed no antagonism with four strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and antagonism with one strain of MRSA and seven methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). CONCLUSIONS: In-vitro exposure to combinations of azithromycin and a fluoroquinolone does not produce a synergistic effect. Antagonism was found in bactericidal assays against some gram-negative bacteria and MSSA; caution is therefore recommended in the use of macrolides and quinolones against these organisms.
TI  - [Microbial associations in Trichomonas urethritis].
AB  - The results on isolation of associated microflora from 190 patients suffering from Trichomonas urethritis are given. Microorganisms belonged to the species: Mycoplasma hominis. Ureaplasma urealyticum. Streptococcus pyogenes. Escherichia coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae. Proteus mirabilis. Moraxella lacunata. Acinetobacter Calcoaceticus and Candida. Staphylococcus cultures which were isolated from 100% patients belonged to 8 species: Staphylococcus aureus, S. intermedius, S. haemolyticus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis, S. hominis, S. warneri, S. saprophyticus. Most of Staphylococcus cultures had pathogenic features. Structure of Trichomonas vaginalis and interaction between them and associated microflora were studied by electron microscopy.
TI  - Cation and sugar selectivity determinants in a novel family of transport proteins.
AB  - A new family of homologous membrane proteins that transport galactosides-pentoses-hexuronides (GPH) is described. By analysing the aligned amino acid sequences of the GPH family, and by exploiting their different specificities for cations and sugars, we have designed mutations that yield novel insights into the nature of ligand binding sites in membrane proteins. Mutants have been isolated/constructed in the melibiose transport proteins of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, and the lactose transport protein of Streptococcus thermophilus which facilitate uncoupled transport or have an altered cation and/or substrate specificity. Most of the mutations map in the amino-terminal region, in or near amphipathic alpha-helices II and IV, or in interhelix-loop 10-11 of the transport proteins. On the basis of the kinetic properties of these mutants, and the primary and secondary structure analyses presented here, we speculate on the cation binding pocket of this family of transporters. The regulation of the transporters through interaction with, or phosphorylation by, components of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system is also discussed.
TI  - Microbiology of mediastinitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbiologic and clinical characteristics of patients with mediastinitis. METHODS: Retrospective review of clinical and laboratory data of 17 patients treated between 1980 and 1987. RESULTS: Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in three patients (18%), anaerobic bacteria only in seven (41%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in seven (41%). In total, there were 42 isolates, 13 aerobic or facultative and 29 anaerobic bacteria, an average of 2.5 per specimen. Anaerobic bacteria predominated in infections that originated from esophageal perforation and orofacial, odontogenic, and gunshot sources. The predominant aerobes were alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (three isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (two isolates), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (two isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (eight isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (seven isolates), and Bacteroides fragilis group (three isolates). CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic nature of mediastinitis.
TI  - Diffusion of 3-quaternary ammonium cephem antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid of patients with bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Cefepime and cefpirome are new beta-lactamase resistant parenteral cephalosporin  derivatives whose spectrum of activity makes them suitable for use in the treatment of severe infections such as bacterial meningitis. However, the published information on the penetration of these new agents into human CSF and on their use in the treatment of bacterial meningitis are really scarce. Experimental studies have shown that cefepime and cefpirome penetrated remarkably well into the CSF of animals infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean changes in bacterial colony count in CSF after cefpirome or cefepime administration express the antibacterial activity of these drugs. Studies in patients show that cefepime and cefpirome crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached concentrations in the CSF that are bactericidal against most potential pathogens. Higher levels are likely to be achieved with multiple dosing and in the presence of inflamed meninges. No study has been performed to investigate the efficacy of cefpirome in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Cefepime was as effective and safe as cefotaxime for treatment of patients with bacterial meningitis as shown in the only clinical trial.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1993)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and the Ikemotor et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1993 to September 1994, 584 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 473 patients with respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 91 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 98 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 91 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 34 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 42 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strain sfor which MICs of methicillin was higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 56.0%, but this frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was lower than the previous year's 61.4%. Arbekacin and vancomycin showed the highest activities against MRSA and MIC80s were 1 microgram/ml. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC90 was 0.063 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were quite active against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime among the cephems showed the most potent activities, and MIC90 were 0.063 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Ofloxacin also showed MIC90 of 0.063 microgram/ml. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Tobramycin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Ceftazidime, cefsulodin, imipenem, aztreonam, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin showed potent activities with MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin showed the highest activity against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml, followed by ciprofloxacin with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested had relatively low activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae. The activities of all drugs except ampicillin and minocycline were high against K. pneumoniae. Cefozopran, imipenem and carumonam showed the highest activities and MIC80s were 0.125 microgram/ml. Flomoxef showed the next highest activities with an MIC80 of 0.25 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis, with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed minocycline and ofloxacin with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological agents. As for patients background, there were many infectious diseases found among patients a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 61.3% of the diseases. The distribution by respiratory tract infections was as follows: chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 31.1% and 26.0%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 10.4%. In this year chronic bronchitis under age 29 were 41.7%, thus was much higher than 12.5% in previous year. This marked change was first noted in your research during the recent 5 years. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by respiratory tract infections, S. pneumoniae (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)
TI  - [Incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A two-year prospective study].
AB  - The prevalence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis admitted to our unit during last two years was studied. Criteria of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis were positive bacteriology and greater than 250/mm3 polymorphonuclear leukocyte count. 84 examinations in 50 patients were made. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was diagnosed in 4 cases. E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, alpha haemolyzing Streptococcus were isolated from ascitic fluid in positive cases. Three patients died despite of therapy, one patient recovered. Bacterascites (positive bacteriology without increased polymorphonuclear leukocyte count) was detected in two cases. Culture-negativ neutrocytic ascites (greater than 250/mm3 polymorphonuclear leukocyte count without positive bacteriology) was detected in four cases. The clinical picture of above-mentioned cases was symptomless. Low protein concentration of ascitic fluid (less than 10 g/l) predisposing to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, was found in 15% of cases. Incidence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and equivocal states found by us was similar to the data given by the literature: 15-20%. Because of the high mortality rate and frequent symptomless course in cirrhotics, importance of diagnostic paracentesis is stressed.
TI  - [Stimulation of synthesis of secretory immunoglobulin A in the lung by oral immunization: an approach with therapeutic relevance?].
AB  - Due to its strategic position on mucosal surfaces secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is one of the first protective factors of the specific immune system against invading pathogens. As a factor of acquired immunity, the synthesis of sIgA can be modulated by various immunization strategies. Our experiments aimed at the enhancement of the sIgA pool in the lungs by oral immunization. As reported previously, commercially available LW 50020, an immunomodulator consisting of lysates of seven common pneumotropic pathogens, is effective in inducing significant IgA antibody responses in the lungs following oral immunization [1]. In the present study we developed new strategies to enhance this effect by encapsulating LW 50020 into microspheres and liposomes. Microspheres and liposomes with entrapped immunomodulator each enhanced the effect of soluble LW 50020 by about 45% and 90%, respectively. In addition, microsphere based immunization induced a significantly increased immunoglobulin G (IgG) response in the lungs. In further experiments we demonstrated that a similar effect could be achieved by administration of a high molecular weight conjugate of lipopolysaccharide from Klebsiella pneumoniae (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes (LTA). This conjugate enhanced the synthesis of IgA in the lungs by 45% and, furthermore, induced a significantly enhanced IgG response in the lungs, without any obvious toxic or pyrogenic side effects. This new conjugate possibly offers an opportunity to replace the complex immunomodulator LW 50020 by a less complex vaccine.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against fresh, clinically isolated strains].
AB  - In order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of ceftriaxone (CTRX), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of CTRX and control drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains including those from purulent meningitis and liver and biliary tract infections in 1995. The results are summarized as follows; 1. MIC90 of CTRX was 0.05 micrograms/ml against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae and it was < or = 0.025 micrograms/ml against beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Antimicrobial activities of CTRX against these strains were stronger than control drugs. 2. MIC distribution of CTRX was in a lower concentration range than those of ceftazidime and flomoxef against extend broad-spectrum beta-lactamase (EBLA)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae. 3. These results suggested that CTRX will be effective against community-acquired pneumonia, purulent meningitis and liver & biliary tract infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1992)].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been investigating susceptibilities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, and the relationships between the isolates and characteristics of the patients and so forth each year. We discuss the results in detail. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1992 to September 1993, 690 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 549 patients with lower respiratory tract infections and presumed to be the etiological bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics were determined against 101 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 121 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 122 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 32 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), 52 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 28 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae etc., and the drug susceptibilities of these strains were measured except the strains which died during transportation. 1. S. aureus S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 61.4% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria was higher than the previous year's 58.3%. MICs values indicated that arbekacin was as active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed potent activities against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefazolin, cefotaxime and cefmenoxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity, and MIC80 was 0.015 microgram/ml. 3. H. influenzae All the drugs tested were potent against H. influenzae. Ampicillin among the penicillins showed MIC80 1 microgram/ml against H. influenzae. Cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, cefuzonam and cefixime showed the most potent activities, and MIC80s were 0.063 microgram/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid) Ciprofloxacin showed the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and MIC80 was 1 microgram/ml. Cefsulodin, aztreonam, carumonam and tobramycin showed the next most potent activities with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin showed the highest activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with an MIC80s of 2 micrograms/ml. Norfloxacin also showed some activity, and MIC80 was 4 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae The activities of all drugs except penicillins were high activities against K. pneumoniae. Carumonam showed the most potent activity with an MIC80 of 0.063 microgram/ml, followed by flomoxef, cefixime and cefozopran with their MIC80s of 0.125 microgram/ml. 7. M.(B.) catarrhalis Imipenem; carbapenems, showed the most potent activity against M.(B.) catarrhalis with an MIC80 0.063 microgram/ml. Minocycline and ofloxacin showed MIC80s 0.125 microgram/ml, respectively. We also investigated year to year changes in the background of patients, as well as types of respiratory infectious diseases, and the etiological bacteria. As for patients backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found among patients in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 60.8% of the diseases. The distribution by lower respiratory tract infections was as follows: bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for the greatest numbers of cases with 30.4%, 29.5%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis with 12.2%. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria for respiratory tract infections, H. influenzae: 22.2%, and S. pneumoniae: 15.1% in chronic bronchitis; S. pneumoniae: 2
TI  - Lung abscess in patients with AIDS.
AB  - We identified 31 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and lung abscess. All patients had advanced HIV disease, and the mean CD4 cell count was 17/mm3 (range, 2-50/mm3). Twenty-two patients (71%) had previous opportunistic infections, and 24 (77%) had previous pulmonary infections. Symptoms at the time of presentation included fever (90% of patients), cough (87%), dyspnea (35%), pleuritic chest pain (26%), and hemoptysis (10%). The microbiological etiology was established for 28 patients, and the pathogens recovered were bacteria (65%), Pneumocystis carinii (6%), fungi (3%), and mixed microorganisms (16%). The pathogens included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), P. carinii (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Aspergillus species (3), viridans streptococcus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1), Streptococcus milleri (1), Proteus mirabilis (1), and Cryptococcus neoformans (1). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not isolated; two patients for whom a microbiological etiology was not established responded to antituberculous therapy. Patients were treated for 2-12 weeks; 25% of the patients received > 4 weeks of therapy. The outcome was poor: 36% of the patients had recurrences, and 19% died. In patients with AIDS, lung abscess is associated with advanced HIV infection, is due to a broad spectrum of pathogens, responds poorly to antibiotics, and has a poor prognosis.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: results of eight European countries.
AB  - In this multicenter study conducted in eight European countries, 13,173 pathogens--all isolated from community-acquired infections in 1992 and 1993--were evaluated for their susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, five in Germany, in the Netherlands and Switzerland, four in Greece and Spain, three in Hungary and one in Finland contributed to this study; ready-to-use standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor system, BBL, Heidelberg, Germany) were used throughout all assays. The most frequently encountered species were: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and non-typhoid Salmonella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Moraxella catarrhalis and Shigella spp. The percentage of susceptible isolates was assessed for each of the above-mentioned countries and European-wide with all the data available. For many species, the percentage of resistant isolates did not differ markedly between the countries considered. However, one of the most striking exceptions was the high prevalence of high-level penicillin-G-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Hungary and Spain; some of the low-level penicillin-G-resistant strains remained susceptible to cefuroxime, whereas complete cross-resistance occurred for all other beta-lactams studied. The high frequency of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae isolates in Spain deserves mentioning; this could be attributed mainly to the prevalence of a beta-lactamase, as the addition of clavulanic acid rendered these strains susceptible to ampicillin. The penicillin compounds exhibited the greatest activity against Gram-positive pathogens, whereas cefetamet was the most active agent against Gram-negative pathogens with a well-balanced spectrum of activity.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: comparable evaluation with other orally available antibiotics  against selected species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil, the prodrug ester of cefetamet, is a new third-generation cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity. The in vitro activity of cefetamet was superior to that of cefaclor, ceftibuten, amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, and amoxicillin alone when tested against 403 strains of freshly isolated upper and lower respiratory tract pathogens. Cefetamet killed 100% Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, at < or = 0.25 mg/l, Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae at < or = 0.5 mg/l, S. agalactiae at < or = 0.1 mg/l, and streptococci at < or = 2.0 mg/l. Moreover, at < or = 4 mg/l (breaking point), cefetamet was also highly effective against Escherichia coli (94%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (92%), K. oxytoca (91%) and, at 1 mg/l, against Moraxella catarrhalis (90%), including beta-lactamase-producing strains. Furthermore, time-killing analyses at 4 x MIC demonstrated that cefetamet was bactericidal against beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and K. pneumoniae within 6 h and S. pneumoniae within 4 h. Hydrolysis studies confirmed cefetamet's stability to TEM1 and SHV1, the most common enterobacterial beta-lactamases.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
TI  - Changing patterns of susceptibilities of blood, urinary and respiratory pathogens in Hong Kong.
AB  - The incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms isolated from blood,  urine and respiratory specimens at a teaching hospital in Hong Kong were studied retrospectively from 1986-1993. The incidence of Gram-positive bacteraemia, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), increased significantly from 33.6 to 47.3% (P < 0.001) while that of Gram-negative bacteraemia fell from 60.0 to 47.0% (P < 0.001). Among blood isolates, methicillin resistance of CNS increased from 17.0 to 58.0% (P < 0.001) and cefuroxime resistance of Enterobacter spp. increased from 21.0 to over 50% (P < 0.01). Among urinary isolates, cefuroxime resistance of Klebsiella spp. (11.0 to 24.0%, P < 0.001) and Enterobacter spp. (32.0 to 75.0%, P < 0.001) increased. Nalidixic acid resistance among Gram-negative urinary isolates, except Proteus mirabilis, rose by three- to sixfold. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, isolated from the respiratory tract, penicillin resistance increased dramatically (2 to 18%, P < 0.001). For respiratory isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, ampicillin resistance increased from 17.0 to 29.0% (P < 0.001). These data are useful in guiding empirical treatment of nosocomial infections.
TI  - Bactericidal kinetics and postantibiotic effect of sparfloxacin against selected  species of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - We determined the bactericidal kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE) of sparfloxacin against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Time-kill studies were performed by using 1 x and 4 x the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and erythromycin (inoculum 10(5) and 10(7) CFU/ml). The PAE was induced by exposing the strains to 1xMIC and 4xMIC of sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin for 1 h. Sparfloxacin was the most bactericidal of all the antibiotics tested, being active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates with a 99.9% reduction within 3 to 6 h of exposure, depending upon strain, inoculum and concentration. The PAE of sparfloxacin against all species tested ranged from 1.1 to 2.6 hours; the most notable PAE occurring with M. catarrhalis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin against freshly isolated clinical strains from outpatients].
AB  - In order to investigate antimicrobial activities of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC) against freshly isolated clinical strains obtained in 1995, beta-lactamase activities and minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results are summarized as follows; 1. Detection frequencies of beta-lactamase producing strains were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA, 90.0%), Haemophilus influenzae (22.0%), Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis (100.0%), Escherichia coli (100.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (100.0%) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (14.0%). It appeared that beta-lactamases produced by these strains were mostly penicillinase or enzyme of similar that. 2. Antimicrobial activities of CVA/AMPC against beta-lactamase producing strains were stronger than those of AMPC, and MIC90 of CVA/AMPC against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae was lower than those of sultamicillin, cefaclor and cefpodoxime. 3. CVA showed strong beta-lactamase inhibitory effect against M.(B.) catarrhalis of direct and indirect pathogenicity. We can expect CVA/AMPC to negate or decrease the influence of indirect pathogenicity.

TI  - [Decreased plasma fibronectin (pFN) level in preterm infants with infections].
AB  - Plasma fibronectic (pFN) is a high molecular weight multifunction glycoprotein, which augments neutrophil and macrofage phagocytosis and acts as a nonspecific opsonin for the reticuloendothelial system. In this study we have determined pFN concentrations in fifty eight preterm infants to discriminate infected from non infected ones. Concentrations of pFN decreased from baselin in babies with early or late onset infections. The changes in pFN concentrations were not found before sepsis, but on day 1. By day 5 pFN concentrations have increased and have been no longer different from controls. We have calculated sensitivity (73.68%), specificity (74.36%), positive (58.35%) and negative (85.29%) predictive values of pFN and of other markers of infections (C-reactive protein--CRP-, Immature/Mature neutrophil ratio--I/M n. ratio-). Adding these tests to pFN, provided equal specificity and positive predictive value, but increased sensitivity (94.73%) and negative predictive value (96.43%). Thus, low concentrations of pFN may be a valuable but not early marker for neonatal infections. The combination of pFN, CRP and I/M n. ratio increase the precision of diagnostic testing.
TI  - [Comparative studies on activities of antimicrobial agents against causative organisms isolated from urinary tract infections (1993). I. Susceptibility distribution].
AB  - The frequencies of isolation and susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents were investigated on 657 bacterial strains isolated from patients with urinary tract infections in 10 hospitals during the period of June 1993 to May 1994. Of the above total bacterial isolates, Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 28.3% and a majority of them were Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Bacterial pneumonia in recipients of bone marrow transplantation. A five-year prospective study.
AB  - Bacterial pneumonia as an important complication of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has not been subjected to comprehensive analysis. Two hundred fifty-five consecutive allogeneic and autologous BMT recipients, ranging in age from 1 month to 53 years, were prospectively followed for 3 days to 3 years (median, 108 days) for development of bacterial pneumonia. Etiology, place acquired, chest radiography, and outcome were recorded and the association between bacterial pneumonia and demographic and clinical variables was analyzed. Thirty-seven (15%) patients experienced 52 episodes of bacterial pneumonia: onset of 13 episodes occurred within 30 days after transplantation, 10 episodes occurred on days +31 to +100, and 29 episodes occurred thereafter. Bacterial pneumonia was the terminal event or contributed to fatal outcome in 8 patients (22% of bacterial pneumonia cases, 3% total study population). Mortality due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (6/21) was significantly higher than (P = 0.03). Bacterial pathogens were identified in 27 (52%) episodes. During the first 100 days after BMT, hospital-acquired Gram-negative bacteria predominated, caused mainly by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter lwoffi, and Enterobacter cloacae. After day +100, community-acquired, Gram-positive bacteria predominated, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae. Haemophilus influenzae occurred periodically. Considering all episodes, significant association was found between bacterial pneumonia and veno-occlusive disease (VOD) (P < 0.01) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P < 0.02). For culture-positive episodes, the association between bacterial pneumonia and VOD was significant (P < 0.001) and borderline for acute GVHD (P = 0.07). It is concluded that VOD and GVHD are positively associated with post-BMT bacterial pneumonia. Its incidence, etiology, risk factors, and outcome are important considerations in its prevention and treatment.
TI  - Retropharyngeal abscess: clinical review.
AB  - Retropharyngeal abscess, once a relatively common entity in children, is uncommon today. From 1981 to 1991, we treated 20 cases. Abscesses secondary to upper respiratory infection in children were seen only in three (15%) cases. Trauma and foreign bodies were the most common etiologic factors in the adult subgroup. Streptococcus viridans and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most common pathogens. The use of contrast-enhanced computed tomography has had a significant impact on the diagnostic work-up. The choice of initial antibiotic therapy is discussed. There were no deaths in this series.
TI  - Activation of human endothelial cells by viable or heat-killed gram-negative bacteria requires soluble CD14.
AB  - In response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS; endotoxin), endothelial cells  are converted to an activation phenotype expressing both proinflammatory and procoagulant properties that include the induction of leukocyte adhesion molecules and tissue factor expression. LPS-induced endothelial cell activation requires a soluble form of the monocyte LPS receptor, sCD14. We evaluated the capacity of multiple strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to induce endothelial E-selectin and tissue factor expression through sCD14-dependent pathways with cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE). Both viable and heat-killed gram-negative bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) but not viable or heat-killed gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) induced prominent E-selectin surface expression detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Tissue factor activity on HUVE, indicated by factor X activation, was induced in response to gram-negative bacteria but not in response to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria induced transcriptional activation in HUVE, indicated by the appearance of E-selectin-specific mRNA and by the demonstration of activation of NF-kappa B, a trans-activating factor necessary for E-selectin and tissue factor gene transcription. In contrast, neither E-selectin mRNA nor activation of NF-kappa B was detected in HUVE treated with gram-positive bacteria. Endothelial cell activation by gram-negative bacteria in each of these assays was inhibited with a monoclonal antibody (60bd) against CD14. Furthermore, CHO-K1 cells, transfected with human recombinant CD14, responded to all strains of gram-negative bacteria (viable or heat killed), indicated by CHO-K1 NF-kappa B activation. We conclude that gram-negative bacteria induce endothelial cell activation through a common sCD14-dependent pathway.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of three acid-stable azalide compounds, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 compared to erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin.
AB  - L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 are novel azalide derivatives of erythromycin  that exhibit improved acid stability over erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin. The half-life in aqueous solution at pH = 2.1 of these compounds ranged from 0.3 hour for erythromycin to 16.2 hours for L-708,299. The rank order of half-life in acid solution from most to least stable was L-708,299 > L-701,677 > L-708,365 > azithromycin = clarithromycin > erythromycin. In a disseminated Streptococcus pyogenes mouse infection model, azithromycin and L-708,365 were slightly more efficacious than clarithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299; all 5 compounds being more active than erythromycin. In a Klebsiella pneumoniae pulmonary challenge mouse model, azithromycin, L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 were all equal in efficacy and at least four-fold more active than clarithromycin and erythromycin. Clarithromycin, L-708,365 and interestingly erythromycin, showed greater bacterial clearance than azithromycin, L-701,677 and L-708,299 in a localized infection model that measured clearance of Staphylococcus aureus from mouse thigh tissues. Our results indicate that L-701,677, L-708,299 and L-708,365 exhibit improved acid stability and were at least equally efficacious as presently marketed macrolide/azalide antibiotics.
TI  - [Bacteremia and sepsis in patients hospitalized at the Dr. Fran Mihaljevic Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Zagreb 1987-1991].
AB  - A total number of 836 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia were examined in 823 hospitalized patients in the University Hospital of Infectious Diseases "Dr Fran Mihaljevic" Zagreb from the beginning of 1987 to the end of 1991. Twenty-five percent of them were nosocomial bacteremias and 5% were polymicrobial bacteremias. The most frequently isolated causative agents were Salmonella spp. (26%), Escherichia coli (17%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%) and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). There were 34% of gram-positive bacteremias. The increased frequency of nosocomial bacteremias caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci was recorded. The frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci strains resistant to gentamicin and Klebsiella spp. strains resistant to cefotaxime was increased. Shock was present in 19% of episodes. Relation between septic shock occurrence and causative agent of bacteremia was not proved. Mortality in patients with bacteremia was 13%, and total mortality was 20%. The outcome of the disease was in direct relation with causative agent of bacteremia. The initial empiric antimicrobial therapy was prolonged in 91% of episodes of bacteremia after blood culture results were known.
TI  - Microflora associated with percutaneous craniofacial implants used for the retention of facial prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  - Craniofacial implants have been used successfully for the retention of facial prostheses. However, complications occur that can lead to the loss of implant integration. One such complication is infection possibly resulting from crevicular microflora activity. As part of an ongoing study, samples from crevicular sites surrounding 17 craniofacial implants were collected and submitted for microbiological assay. The results demonstrated the presence of opportunistic pathogens in many sites regardless of subjects' hygiene efforts. The significance of the findings is reviewed.

TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1991)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory tract infections were collected since 1981 in  cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, and have been investigated for their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics and reported by IKEMOTO, et al. Relationships between these isolates and backgrounds of the patients were also studied each year. These results are discussed in detail in this report. In 20 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1991 to September 1992, 631 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from sputa of 529 patients with respiratory tract infections and tentatively determined to be etiological agents. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 96 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 112 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 111 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 114 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (non-mucoid), 41 strains of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, 39 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid), Klebsiella pneumoniae and some others, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were determined except for the strains that had been killed during transportation: 1. S. aureus. S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 4 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 58.3% and the frequency of the drug resistant bacteria increased over previous year's 42.5%. As shown by the MICs, arbekacin was active as vancomycin against all the strains on S. aureus. 2. S. pneumoniae: Benzylpenicillin among the penicillins showed a potent activity against S. pneumoniae. Cefuzonam, cefmenoxime, cefozopran and cefotaxime among the cephems showed excellent antimicrobial activities against S. pneumoniae. Imipenem; a penem antibiotic, showed the most potent activity with MIC80 of 0.03 micrograms/ml. 3. H. influenzae: Activities of all drugs were excellent against H. influenzae strains tested. Ampicillin showed MIC80 of 1 micrograms/ml against H. influenzae. Cefuzonam showed the most potent activity among cephems, it completely killed all bacteria at MIC 0.06 micrograms/ml. Cefotaxime and cefmenoxime showed next most potent activities with MIC80s of 0.06 micrograms/ml. The antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin was equivalent to those of cephems. 4. P. aeruginosa (mucoid). Ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), and their MIC80s were 4 micrograms/ml. 5. P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid): Similarly, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin showed the most potent activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid) with MIC80 of 2 micrograms/ml. Comparing to activities against P. aeruginosa (mucoid), all the drugs tested showed lower activities against P. aeruginosa (non-mucoid). 6. K. pneumoniae: The activities of all drugs except for penicillins were very high against K. pneumoniae.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of furopenem against aerobic bacteria isolated from pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the oral penem furopenem (WY-49605, 545555, SUN5555, and ALP201) was tested against clinical bacteria isolated from pediatric patients. Furopenem was compared with clarithromycin, cefpodoxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefaclor, cefixime, and cefuroxime. Furopenem demonstrated consistent activity against Escherichia coli [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) = 1.0 microgram/ml)] Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90 = 2.0 micrograms/ml), Salmonella enteriditis and Shigella spp. (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml), and beta-lactamase-positive or -negative Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml) and Moraella catarrhalis (MIC90 = 1.0 microgram/ml). Furopenem was also active against a number of the Gram-positive organisms tested including methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results suggest a potential application for this agent in the treatment of children as outpatients.
TI  - Treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients--a comparison of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin. COPD Study Group.
AB  - Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were compared in an open, randomised prospective multicentre study in the treatment of acute exacerbations of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in hospitalised patients. One-hundred-and-seventy-three patients were enrolled; 164 were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 98 for bacteriological efficacy, with 144 pathogens isolated. The predominant pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae (n = 30), Streptococcus pneumoniae (18), Staphylococcus aureus (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11), Moraxella catarrhalis (8), other Gram-negative bacteria (Neisseria, Klebsiella, Proteus, and Enterobacter spp.) (53) and other Gram-positive bacteria (12). A single bacterial pathogen was identified in 61 patients, whereas two bacterial pathogens were isolated in 31 patients and three in six patients. The clinical response at the end of treatment was very high in both groups with a satisfactory outcome (cured or improved) in 97.6% of the meropenem patients and in 96.3% of the imipenem/cilastatin patients; at follow-up the rates were 89.1% and 89.8%, respectively. The bacterial success (eradication or presumed eradication) was 88.2% in the meropenem group and 89.4% in the comparator group. Nausea or vomiting were reported more frequently in patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin, whereas in the meropenem group an increase in aminotransferases was reported. One patient treated with imipenem/cilastatin was withdrawn from the study due to seizures. Meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin were highly effective for the treatment of severe bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis but meropenem was better tolerated.
TI  - Virulence factors in the colonization and persistence of bacteria in the airways.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are commonly isolated from sputum specimens of patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and M. catarrhalis have several pathogenic properties in common. These bacteria are able to interact with mucus, to exert ciliotoxic activity, to adhere to bronchial epithelial cells, and to invade airway epithelium. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae strains persist for many months in the respiratory tract of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite the specific antibodies present in serum and sputum against the persistent strain. Especially during exacerbations persistent strains with changes in their antigenic composition are isolated. Among H. influenzae strains, the antigenic characteristics of the outer membrane protein composition vary. Variation in S. pneumoniae occurs in capsular polysaccharides, the major immunogens of this bacterium. Such variations affect the efficacy of the antibody-mediated defense mechanisms against the bacteria. Between exacerbations, particularly H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae strains are recovered from the sputum of patients with COPD. Recovery may continue for periods up to 2 yr, although not continuously. Besides ineffective antibody-mediated defense mechanisms, it is likely that hiding of the bacteria in tissue contributes to the persistence of these bacteria in patients with COPD.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
AB  - The case records of all neonates admitted to the neonatal unit of Al Wasl Hospital (Dubai) in a period of 60 months (May 1987-April 1992) were analysed. One-hundred-and-six neonates had confirmed sepsis. The most common causative organisms were Group B Streptococci (23 per cent), E. coli (17 per cent), Staph. epidermidis (17 per cent), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16 per cent). Group B Streptococcus presented as the most common organism in very early (< or = 24 hours) and early onset (2-6 days) of sepsis (34 per cent, 21/61), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24 per cent), Staphylococcal epidermidis (18 per cent) and Candida (13 per cent) were most common organisms causing late onset of sepsis (7-30 days). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae had highest mortality (71 per cent, 5/7; and 59 per cent, 10/17, respectively). Lowest mortality (4 per cent, 1/25) was observed in Group B Streptococcus sepsis. Prematurity, low birth weight, and nosocomial sepsis were high risk factors associated with fatal outcome.
TI  - Chemotherapeutic activity of levofloxacin (HR 355, DR-3355) against systemic and  localized infections in laboratory animals.
AB  - Ofloxacin, its optical isomers levofloxacin (HR 355, DR-3355) and D-ofloxacin (DR-3354) and ciprofloxacin were administered orally to mice and rats which had systemic and localized infections. Both levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were equally effective in treating systemic murine infections caused by staphylococci. Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ED50s ranging from 0.18 to 15.8 mg/kg and 0.42 to 16.3 mg/kg respectively and both these agents were twice as effective as ofloxacin which had an ED50 0.41 to 39.7 mg/kg. In contrast, D-ofloxacin was either inactive or exhibited only modest chemotherapeutic activity against the staphylococci and the Gram-negative organisms tested. When given to mice to treat staphylococcal abscesses and lung infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S levofloxacin was up to four times more effective and produced a more pronounced bactericidal effect against the pathogens in vivo than the reference compounds. Despite possessing a similar, if not lesser, in-vitro activity against the infecting pathogens, levofloxacin was more effective than ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in rats with localized infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Bacterial agents causing chronic suppurative otitis media.
AB  - Ear swabs from 350 patients with chronic otitis media attending different orthorhinolaryngological clinics at different hospitals and health centres in Benin City and Ekpoma in Edo State were screened for the presence of bacterial agents of chronic otitis media. Results revealed the presence of 19 different species indicating polymicrobial infections. Species isolated comprised Staphylococcus aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.3%), Proteus mirabilis (17%), Alcaligenes faecalis (6.2%) and Klebsiella aerogenes (4.3%). Others included Escherichia coli (3.3%), Proteus rettgeri (2.8%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter spp, Proteus morgani, Haemophilus influenzae, Providencia spp, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, non-haemolytic streptococci and Diphotheroids, each accounted for less than 2% of isolates. The study also showed a higher prevalence of chronic otitis media among males (55.7%) than females (44.3%). Cases of chronic otitis media were highest among the age groups (0-5 years) with a prevalence rate of 50% and least among the 6-10 year age group with a prevalence rate of 14.9%. Antibiogram of isolates revealed marked sensitivities (over 90% of the isolates) to ciproxin, tarivid, rocephin and fortum whereas over 70% were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin. Results have indicated that Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis are leading bacterial agents of otitis media and highlights the high risk involved in the use of penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, cloxacillin and septrin in the management of chronic otitis media in our locality.
TI  - Third generation oral cephalosporins: comparative in vitro kinetics.
AB  - In order to provide additional data on the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefetamet-pivoxil against respiratory pathogens, we determined the bactericidal kinetics of this antibiotic in comparison to cefixime and ceftibuten against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. time-kill studies were performed by using concentrations equal to a x MIC, and 4 x MIC of the antibiotics tested and different inocula (10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml). The strains were incubated in a shaking incubator at 37 degrees C and 1 ml samples were removed at regular intervals for viable count determination. The antibiotics were eliminated by serial ten-fold dilutions in physiological saline before plating. At 4 x MIC of cefetamet and at 10(5) CFU/ml inoculum the results were 99.9% killing or more of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis at 4 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h, and of E. coli and K. pneumoniae within 4 to 6 h. At the same concentration of MIC and with the same inoculum a 99.9% reduction was achieved against S. pneumoniae within 4 h and against S. pyogenes within 2 h with no regrowth at 24 h in both cases. Similar results were obtained using 10(7) and 10(9) CFU/ml inocula. Cefetamet had efficient killing activity even at lower concentrations. Bactericidal kinetics of cefetamet favorably compare with those of cefixime and ceftibuten. The efficient bactericidal activity of cefetamet-pivoxil indicates a clinical role for this new oral cephalosporin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - TOC-39, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin with excellent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - TOC-39, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is a hydroxyimino-type cephem antibiotic  with vinylthio-pyridyl moiety at the 3 position. TOC-39 was evaluated for antibacterial activity against various clinically isolated strains. TOC-39 had excellent activity, stronger than that of methicillin, oxacillin, the cephalosporins tested, imipenem, gentamicin, minocycline, tobramycin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and had an MIC comparable to that of vancomycin (the MICs of TOC-39 and vancomycin for 90% of the strains tested were 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively). Against Enterococcus faecalis strains, which are resistant to cephalosporins, TOC-39 was twice as active as ampicillin. Against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, TOC-39 was twice as active as or more active than cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome. Against Streptococcus pyogenes, TOC-39 was superior to cefotiam, ceftazidime, and flomoxef and was similar to cefpirome. In addition, the activity of TOC-39 was equal to or greater than that of cefotiam, ceftazidime, flomoxef, and cefpirome against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Morganella morganii. In terms of bactericidal effect against MRSA, TOC-39 was superior to vancomycin. No mutant resistant to TOC-39 or vancomycin was obtained from susceptible MRSA strains. In murine systemic infection models, TOC-39 showed potent activity against S. aureus and E. coli. Against highly MRSA, the activity of TOC-39 was comparable to that of vancomycin.
TI  - A single daily dose of ceftriaxone for bacterial meningitis in adults: experience with 84 patients and review of the literature.
AB  - Although the pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone allows its administration in a single daily dose, this practice is not standard in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. Herein, we review our experience and that of other investigators with this mode of therapy. We used a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (50 mg/[kg.d]; maximum, 4 g/d) for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in 84 adult patients. Meningitis was due to Neisseria meningitidis in 34 cases, to Streptococcus pneumoniae in 25, to Escherichia coli in three, to Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, to Haemophilus influenzae in two, to viridans streptococci in two, and to an unknown agent in 16. Eleven patients died, for an overall mortality of 13%; therapy failed in three additional cases. The mean trough levels of ceftriaxone in cerebrospinal fluid was 3.5 micrograms/mL; the median trough bactericidal titer at this site was 1:128. Both our experience and that in the literature suggest that a single daily dose is optimal when ceftriaxone is used for the treatment of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sulbactam/ampicillin against clinically isolated microbial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities were examined for sulbactam/ampicillin (SBT/ABPC) against clinically isolated microbial strains in 1987, 1990, 1994. Besides, the beta-lactamase productivity and MICs of these strains were measured, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. The ratio of beta-lactamase producing strains were 90% of methicillin (DMPPC)-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus (MSSA), about 80% of DMPPC-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 100% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, 95% of Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and 15-20% of Haemophilus influenzae. Several kinds of beta-lactamase productivity were observed. 2. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC against beta-lactamase producing strains of MSSA, M. (B.) catarrhalis, H. influenzae, and almost all of Enterobacteriaceae were stronger than those of ampicillin (ABPC) and piperacillin (PIPC), but antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were weak against MRSA and cephems (CEPs)-resistant strains detected in some of Enterobacteriaceae. 3. It appeared that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) or PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) and CEPs-resistant Escherichia coli increased year by year. 4. Antimicrobial activities of SBT/ABPC were strong against Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, M. (B.) catarrhalis and H. influenzae including beta-lactamase producing strains. Additionally, beta-lactamase inhibiting effect of SBT was observed against beta-lactamase produced by S. aureus and K. pneumoniae which demonstrate indirect pathogenicity. Thus, SBT/ABPC is an injectable antibiotic that is expected to demonstrate clinical usefulness, especially as the first line drug for the respiratory tract infections that are community-acquired.
TI  - A 4-year study of neonatal meningitis: clinical and microbiological findings.
AB  - The clinical and microbiological data of 60 neonates, 23 from the Neonatal Unit (Group I) and 37 (Group II) from the General Paediatric Wards with meningitis are presented. The overall prevalence/1000 was significantly lower in Group I (0.36) than in Group II (1.11; P < 0.0001). This low incidence follows the introduction of amikacin for the treatment of the ill neonate in 1986. Streptococcus agalactiae 21 (35 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae 17 (28 per cent) and E. coli 10 (17 per cent) were the commonest pathogens accounting for 80 per cent of the cases. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates were uniformly susceptible to penicillin and chloramphenicol. Gram negative isolates showed resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol and sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim. In addition K. pneumoniae isolates showed resistance to gentamycin and amikacin. All isolates were fully susceptible to cefotaxime. Recently, four of six cases of K. pneumoniae in the Neonatal Unit were resistant to amikacin. Low birth weight, additional clinical problems, and ultrasound changes on cranial scanning carried a poor prognosis. Emphasis should be placed on close collaboration between clinicians and microbiologists in the choice of antimicrobial agents and aseptic techniques for the care of neonates.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine and combinations of these compounds].
AB  - Using a broth microdilution technique, the in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the equine respiratory tract to trimethoprim, sulfadoxine, sulfadimethoxine, and combinations of these compounds was determined. The bacterial strains (n = 88) isolated recently from horses with respiratory symptoms belonged to the following species: Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (n = 34), Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Rhodococcus equi (n = 4), Pseudomonas spp. (n = 3) and Escherichia coli (n = 3). In addition, two isolates of Enterobacter spp. and one isolate of Streptococcus equisimilis, Staphylococcus intermedius, Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens were examined. For determination of susceptibility of an organism the following minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were fixed as limiting values: Trimethoprim < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, sulfadoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, sulfadimethoxine < or = 32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml, trimethoprim/sulfadimethoxine < or = 0.5/32 micrograms/ml. As expected, Rhodococcus-equi-isolates were resistant to the antimicrobials tested. However, most of the clinically more common isolates showed a high degree of susceptibility to the combinations. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices indicated synergism of the combination-partners in a wide range. According to these in vitro results, application of trimethoprim/sulfonamide combinations for the initial therapy of equine respiratory tract infections can be recommended.
TI  - Efficacy of a three day course of azithromycin in moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a 3 day course of azithromycin in low to moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia. Forty patients with low to moderately severe community-acquired pneumonia (29 males, 11 females, mean age 46 +/- 17 yrs; 20 pretreated with betalactams for 2-10 days with no results before admission to hospital; 18 with evidence of co-morbidity) were enrolled in an open, randomized study with azithromycin, 500 mg q.d. oral therapy for 3 days, versus clarithromycin, 250 mg b.i.d. oral therapy for 10 +/- 2 days. The aetiology of pneumonia was identified in 18 patients by serology (nine Mycoplasma pneumoniae, four Chlamydia pneumoniae, five Legionella pneumophila; one patient with chlamydial infection also had Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia). A presumptive aetiological diagnosis was obtained with sputum culture in three other patients (one Haemophilus influenzae, two Haemophilus parainfluenzae), all strains were sole isolates with 10(8) Colony forming units (CFU), and with Gram stain in one patient with Streptococcus pneumoniae. All patients in the azithromycin group (one after a second 3 day course), and all but two (of those available for evaluation) of the clarithromycin group were cured. Defervescence occurred after 2.6 +/- 1.6 days, and chest roentgenogram cleared after 8.9 +/- 3.3 days, with no difference between the two groups. Tolerance was good, and there were no withdrawals from therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - The aetiology of severe community-acquired pneumonia and its impact on initial, empiric, antimicrobial chemotherapy.
AB  - Of 259 patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe acute community-acquired pneumonia, 173 had primary infections and 86 had secondary infections. The commonest organism isolated in each group was Streptococcus pneumoniae (51.3 and 36.6% of known isolates in each group respectively). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the next most common isolate (31.9 and 29.3% respectively). A variety of other Gram-negative organisms and Staphylococcus aureus accounted for most of the remaining pathogens. Based on retrospective analysis of data, there appeared to be no difference in the alcohol consumption of patients with infection due to S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae. The overall mortality rate for the primary infections was 47.4%, with 68.4% of these infections due to K. pneumoniae and 33.9% due to the pneumococcus (P < 0.002). Among the secondary infections, the overall mortality rate was 40.8% (not significantly different to that of primary infections) with 45.5% due to K. pneumoniae and 23.1% due to the pneumococcus (not significantly different on statistical analysis, probably due to low patient numbers). Our investigation confirms that severe community-acquired pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae is extremely common, even in patients without obvious risk factors for Gram-negative colonization. This organism is contributing to the high mortality rate seen in our intensive care unit among patients with pneumonia, and our empiric therapy for such cases routinely includes a combination of agents active against this organism (e.g. a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside).
TI  - Antibacterial activity of a substance produced by the fungus Pycnoporus sanguineus (Fr.) Murr.
AB  - A fraction obtained from the culture fluids of Pycnoporus sanguineus fungus was shown to contain a compound with biological activity against strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and members of the genus Streptococcus. The fraction was clearly more active on Gram-positive cocci than on Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Multicentre comparative study on the antibacterial activity of FK-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of FK-037, a new parenteral cephalosporin structurally related to cefpirome and cefepime, was compared with that of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, cefpirome, cefepime, imipenem and meropenem against 1,837 clinical isolates obtained from three Spanish hospitals. FK-037 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates at < or = 0.25 microgram/ml, with the exception of Enterobacter aerogenes (MIC90 1 microgram/ml), Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml). In cefotaxime- and ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains producing SHV-2 and SHV-6 beta-lactamases, the activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was similar (MIC range 0.25-32 micrograms/ml). In Enterobacteriaceae strains hyper-producing chromosomally inducible beta-lactamases, FK-037 (MIC90 range, 0.25-8 micrograms/ml) was 8- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime and ceftazidime but two- to eightfold less active than cefpirome and cefepime. FK-037 and cefpirome were twofold more active than ceftazidime and cefepime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, with MIC90 values of 16 micrograms/ml. The activity of FK-037, cefpirome and cefepime was two- to eightfold lower in ceftazidime-resistant derepressed Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutants. FK-037 (MIC range, 0.12-2 micrograms/ml) and the other beta-lactam agents tested were active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci; however, only cefpirome and, particularly, FK-037 (MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml) displayed some activity against methicillin-resistant strains. In penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, the MIC90s of FK-037 were 0.03, 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Respiratory syncytial virus--associated lower respiratory diseases in hospitalised pre-school children in Ibadan.
AB  - An analysis of the features of lower respiratory diseases (LRD) associated with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in 21 children aged 1-23 months, indicated that the clinical features did not differ appreciably from those described for LRD due to other infective agents. It was however, remarkable that none of the children was grossly malnourished, neither was there any death. The final respiratory diagnoses were bronchiolitis alone (6 cases), bronchopneumonia (6 cases), empyema/pleural effusion (3 cases, including one with bronchopneumonia), lobar pneumonia (3 cases, including one with associated bronchopneumonia). Streptococcus pneumonia and Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively, were isolated from blood culture in the two cases with lobar pneumonia alone. One child had laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) alone and another, croup associated with bronchiolitis and bronchopneumonia. Radiologically, the single most common lesion was patchy consolidation (8 cases) followed by hyper-inflation (6 cases); in one case, there was no observable lesion on the chest radiograph. All the 6 children who had bronchiolitis alone were aged 12 months and below, and were well nourished; conversely, 8 of the 12 children with pneumonia alone or in addition to other lesions and both children with pleural effusion, were older than 12 months and underweight. Other viral agents were identified in 8 (38%) of the cases. Complications included heart failure in 4 cases and a combination of anaemia and heart failure in one child with empyema. In a child with symptom complex and radiological features suggestive of acute obstructive lower respiratory infection with immunofluorescence evidence of RSV infection, age and nutritional status are important factors in determining the need for antibiotic therapy pending the outcome of bacterial cultures.
TI  - A prospective study of microorganisms in urine and bladder biopsies from interstitial cystitis patients and controls.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the bladder of unknown etiology. We tested the hypothesis that a microorganism would be found at higher prevalence in urine or bladder tissue from women with IC than from control women. METHODS: Urine and bladder tissue were obtained at cystoscopy from 11 IC patients and 7 control subjects. These specimens were cultured for a variety of fastidious and nonfastidious bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, and viruses. In addition, special staining techniques were used to examine biopsy specimens and cytospun urine, and tissue sections and outgrowths of explanted bladder cells were examined by electron microscopy. RESULTS: Cultures of urine from 6 of 11 IC patients grew five different bacteria (Corynebacterium sp. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Lactobacillus sp, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus morbillorum), human cytomegalovirus, or Torulopsis glabrata; one of these organisms (Lactobacillus sp) was found in urine from 2 patients. Although contamination by urethral organisms is possible, the prevalence of microorganisms in urine of IC patients (6 of 11) was significantly greater than in urine of control subjects (0 of 7) (P < 0.05). Acridine orange staining revealed rods with appropriate morphology in urine from 4 of the 5 IC patients who had positive bacterial cultures and yeastlike organisms in urine and bladder tissue specimens that grew Torulopsis. Additionally, rodlike organisms were seen in urine from 2 IC patients with negative bacterial cultures and cocci were seen in the urine of 1 control patient. Biopsy specimens from 2 IC patients grew Torulopsis sp or Lactobacillus sp, in agreement with the results of acridine orange staining and culture of urine from these patients; in contrast, specimens from 3 control subjects grew small numbers of Pseudomonas sp or Staphylococcus epidermidis, but no organisms were cultured from urine or seen in acridine orange-stained tissue smears. All other cultures and stains were negative. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not provide evidence that IC is associated with infection or colonization by a single microorganism. However, they do generate the hypothesis that the prevalence of microorganisms, especially bacteria at low concentrations, is greater in the urine of IC patients than of control subjects. If these results are confirmed by other controlled studies, the question of whether the presence of these organisms is a cause or a result of IC should be addressed.
TI  - Influence of pulmonary surfactant on in vitro bactericidal activities of amoxicillin, ceftazidime, and tobramycin.
AB  - The influence of a natural pulmonary surfactant on antibiotic activity was investigated to assess the possible use of exogenous surfactant as a vehicle for antibiotic delivery to the lung. The influence of surfactant on the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the influence of surfactant on the activities of ceftazidime and tobramycin was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae. In vitro antibiotic activity was determined by killing curve studies in media with and without surfactant. Amoxicillin and ceftazidime activities were not changed in the presence of surfactant, except for a decreased killing rate of S. pneumoniae by ceftazidime in medium with additional rabbit serum. In contrast, killing curves with low concentrations of tobramycin (0.25x and 1x the MIC) showed a decreased level of activity of tobramycin against all pathogens tested in the presence of surfactant. With higher tobramycin concentrations (4x the MIC) killing rates were decreased less or were unchanged in the presence of surfactant. Concluding from the results of the study, both amoxicillin and ceftazidime can be combined with surfactant without the loss of activity. For mixing surfactant with tobramycin, dosages should be adjusted to overcome the partial inactivation of tobramycin by surfactant.
TI  - The effects of X-ray contrast media on bacterial growth.
AB  - Six widely used X-ray contrast media (XRC) were tested against nine commonly isolated organisms to determine the practicality of using XRC to outline body spaces prior to obtaining specimens for culture and to assess the feasibility of using XRC in divided doses to reduce cost. Preparations of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus milleri in two approximate concentrations of 10(4) and 10(8) colony forming units/mL (cfu/mL) were inoculated into the following XRC: Conray 280, Hexabrix 320, lopamiro 370, Omnipaque 350, Ultravist 300 and Optiray 320 each in two concentrations. Sampling was performed in triplicate at 0, 2, 4 and 20 h with the 20 h counts made after exposure at both 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. There were 16 significant interactions, predominantly with the Gram-negative organisms. Conray 280 produced the greatest number of effects. Most effects were bacteriostatic. Organisms were most susceptible at low concentration and after prolonged contact with XRC. No effect was seen with dilute XRC. All weekly sterility checks were negative. Non-ionic XRC have no significant effect on the growth of Gram-positive organisms and little effect on Gram-negative organisms if processing is performed promptly. Using standard aseptic technique, no contamination of XRC occurred, suggesting multi-dosing may be a safe and cost-effective method of XRC utilization.
TI  - Pulmonary penetration of ceftazidime.
AB  - For an antibiotic to be effective in lower respiratory tract infections, it should be available in adequate concentrations in respiratory tissues and fluids. Cephalosporins usually achieve modest concentrations in the respiratory tract. In this study we have determined the pulmonary penetration of intramuscularly administered ceftazidime (a single dose of 1 g). Levels of ceftazidime in bronchial secretions (BS), bronchial mucosa (BM), epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and serum (S) were measured by microbiological assay in 25 patients suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis who were divided into 5 groups of 5 subjects according to sampling time (1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours after the administration of the antibiotic). The peak S level was high (39.89 +/- 10.42 micrograms/ml at 1 hour) and mean S concentrations decreased slowly and were still detectable at 12 hours (1.07 +/- 0.45 microgram/ml). In all other samples, mean concentrations were in excess of the ceftazidime minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for many relevant respiratory pathogens (Haemophilus influenzae 0.15 microgram/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis 0.06 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae 0.15 micrograms/ml; Klebsiella pneumoniae 0.4 microgram/ml). Concentrations in BM (7.05 +/- 2.38, 8.14 +/- 2.23, 6.40 +/- 1.63, 4.06 +/- 0.99 and 0.45 +/- 0.27 microgram/g) were higher than that in BS (6.87 +/- 1.96, 6.54 +/- 1.84, 3.52 +/- 1.23, 1.56 +/- 0.92 and 0.23 +/- 0.19 microgram/ml).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparative evaluation of orally active antibiotics against community-acquired pathogens: a multi-center study in five Mediterranean countries.
AB  - In 5 Mediterranean countries 7902 pathogens, all isolated in 1992 and 1993 from community-acquired infections, were studied for susceptibility to the following orally active antibiotics: penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid (both 2:1 ratio), cefalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline and erythromycin. Ten centers in Italy, 4 centers in Greece, 3 centers in Spain, and 1 center in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia contributed to this study; all centers used performed standardized microtiter panels (Sceptor, BBL, Heidelberg, FRG). The most frequently isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli (n = 1267), Proteus mirabilis (n = 843), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 771), enteric Salmonella spp. (n = 629), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 486), Citrobacter freundii (n = 383), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 346), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 298), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 294), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 246), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 243), and Shigella spp. (n = 185). Statistical analysis was performed for each of the above countries and for all pooled data available. The penicillin antibiotics were the most active compounds against the gram-positive cocci, exceeding the MIC90 values 2- to 8-fold over all cephalosporins. Regarding the gram-negatives (above all Klebsiella spp.) cefetamet was by far the most active compound (MIC90 = 1 mg/l). Regarding the percentage of resistant isolates, there were no striking discrepancies between the centers and countries involved in this study. There was, however, complete cross-resistance in penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC90 = 2 mg/l). By far the majority of the penicillin-resistant pneumococci showed additional resistance to doxycycline and erythromycin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Spectral Studies and Bactericidal, Fungicidal, Insecticidal and Parasitological Activities of Organotin(IV) Complexes of Thio Schiff Bases Having no Donor Atoms.
AB  - Twelve new organotin(IV) complexes of the type RnSnLm [where n = 3, m = 1, R = CH(3) or C(6)H(5); n = 2, m = 2, R = C(6)H(5) or C(4)H(9) ; L = anion of Schiff bases derived from the condensation of 2-amino-5-(o-anisyl)-l,3,4-thiadiazole with salicylaldehyde (HL-1), 2- hydroxynaphthaldehyde (HL-2) and 2-hydroxyacetophenone (HL-3)] have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductances, electronic, infrared, far-infrared, (1)H NMR and (119)Sn Mossbauer spectral studies. Thermal studies of two complexes, viz., Ph(3)Sn (L-1) and Ph(2)Sn(L-2)(2) have been carried out in the temperature range 25-1000 composite functionC using TG, DTG and DTA techniques. All these complexes decompose gradually with the formation of SnO(2) as an end product. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the Schiff bases and their complexes has also been determined against Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus Penicillin resistance (2500 units), Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporotrichum schenckii, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Aspergillus fumigatus. The Schiff bases (HL-1), (HL-2) and the organotin(IV) compounds have also been tested against various important herbicidal, fungicidal, insecticidal species and also for parasitological activity against freeliving nematode.
TI  - Structure and functions of endotoxin-binding peptides derived from CAP18.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein, 18kDa) is a 142 amino acid protein originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using agglutination of LPS-coated erythrocytes as an assay. CAP-18 is composed of an N-terminal domain of unknown function (CAP181-105) and a C-terminal LPS-binding domain (CAP18106-142). Synthetic CAP18106-142 and CAP18106-137, a 32-amino acid peptide resulting from the truncation of 5 amino acids from the C-terminus of CAP18106-142, inhibited LPS-induced tissue factor generation, nitric oxide production and TNF release by macrophages. Mice treated with CAP18106-142 or CAP18106-137 were significantly protected from LPS lethality. Although CAP18106-142 and CAP18106-137 were highly active, other fragments of CAP18106-142, including CAP18110-142 with a truncated N-terminus, did not exhibit LPS-binding and LPS-neutralizing activities. Both peptides had broad anti-microbial activity against both Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IC50; 40-100 nM) and Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus(Methicillin sensitive and resistant strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (IC50; 100-200nM). We cloned a CAP18 family protein from human granulocytes. The cloned cDNA encoded 140 amino acid residues. Human CAP18 (CAP181-140) was highly homologous to that of rabbit. A 32- amino-acid C-terminal fragment (CAP18104-135) was shown to bind LPS, inhibit LPS-induced tissue factor generation by murine macrophages, and protect mice from LPS lethality. This peptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We hypothesize that CAP18 and the derived peptides bind to LPS and alter the capacity of LPS to initiate disseminated intravascular coagulation. In this regard, CAP may act as host defense protein against infectious diseases, and have therapeutic potential for sepsis and endotoxin shock.
TI  - Trends in antimicrobial resistance among today's bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Resistance of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem with significant clinical consequences. Microbiologic surveillance data, such as those provided by the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, supply information on current nosocomial pathogens in the United States. Many species show resistance to commonly used antimicrobials and, in many cases, it is emerging resistance. Resistance in many gram-negative bacteria is caused by beta-lactamase production. Escherichia coli, the leading nosocomial pathogen, is capable of hyperproducing TEM-1 beta-lactamase. A novel form of resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli is caused by extended-spectrum cephalosporinases. Many Enterobacteriaceae can be induced to produce group 1 beta-lactamase by exposure to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and other beta-lactams. Thirty percent of Haemophilus influenzae isolates are resistant to ampicillin because of beta-lactamase production. Issues of concern in gram-positive species include multiple antimicrobial resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci, and increasing beta-lactam resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. To minimize the development of resistance, antimicrobials must be administered judiciously, and infection-control practices must be instituted and followed.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of SY5555 in pediatrics].
AB  - We assessed the in vitro antimicrobial activity and the clinical efficacy and safety of SY5555 in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. In vitro antibacterial activities of SY5555 against 52 clinical isolates were compared with those of clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefaclor (CCL) and cefdinir (CFDN). Against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes, SY5555 displayed antimicrobial activities superior or nearly equivalent to those of the reference agents used in the study. In cases of Gram-negative bacteria, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 against Haemophilus influenzae was inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN. Against Klebsiella pneumoniae, the antimicrobial activity of SY5555 was less potent than that of CPDX. 2. Forty-seven children with infectious diseases were treated with SY5555 dry syrup (powder dissolved just before use). The clinical results were excellent in 24 and good in 16, with an efficacy rate of 85.1%. 3. Bacteriological screening identified 30 pathogenic organisms, and the eradication rate was 76.7%. 4. Side effects consisted of diarrhea in 12.5% (6 cases), loose stools in 4.2% (2 cases) and urticaria in 2.1% (1 case) of the patients. The only abnormal laboratory test value observed was an increase in eosinophil count in one child. 5. The palatability of SY5555 dry syrup was very good; it was very easily ingestable or easily ingestable by 32 of the 48 children. From the above results, SY5555 dry syrup appears to be a useful drug with a preferable safety profile in the treatment of pediatric patients with infectious diseases.

TI  - [Antibacterial activities of cefetamet against clinically isolated strains from community acquired respiratory tract infections (II)].
AB  - Antibacterial activities of cefetamet (CEMT) against clinically isolated strains  from patients with community acquired respiratory tract infections were compared to those of other oral beta-lactam antibiotics in the period from January to March 1994. The following results were obtained. 1. CEMT showed strong antibacterial activities against three major pathogens causing community acquired respiratory tract infections, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. However, antibacterial activities of CEMT against benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) and PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) were slightly weaker than of those of some the reference antibiotics. 2. No MIC value changes of CEMT were observed from year to year against Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae DNA.
AB  - In this study, we have developed a chemically sensitive and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic DNA. The target DNA sequence was a 322-base pair segment of the S. pneumoniae DNA polymerase I gene (pol I). PCR products of pure cultures of a set of pneumococcal serotypes commonly associated with human infection could be amplified in water and in blood cultures of clinical isolates containing S. pneumoniae. We were able to detect 2 fg of purified S. pneumoniae DNA. There were no false-positive reactions when the assay was performed on samples containing the following clinically encountered bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae type B, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas spp. nontypeable H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The addition of EDTA and citrate-anticoagulated whole blood to the PCR reaction mixture inhibited the PCR assay, whereas the addition of lithium heparin, sodium heparin, and sodium polyanetholesulfonate-anticoagulated whole blood to PCR reaction mixture did not interfere with the ability to detect the presence of S. pneumoniae DNA.
TI  - Comparison of the antibody responses to the 77 Klebsiella capsular types in ankylosing spondylitis and various rheumatic diseases.
AB  - The production of antibodies to Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides was measured  in sera from either HLA-B27-positive (HLA-B27+) or HLA-B27-negative (HLA-B27-) patients with classical ankylosing spondylitis (n = 54). These sera were compared with sera from patients with various rheumatic diseases (n = 82) and HLA-B27+ or HLA-B27- healthy individuals (n = 85). All sera were analyzed by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific to each of the 77 Klebsiella serotypes. The sera from HLA-B27+ patients with ankylosing spondylitis showed a significantly higher antibody frequency to the capsular types K26, K36, and K50 than the sera from HLA-B27- ankylosing spondylitis patients, patients with psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or reactive arthritis after Yersinia enterocolitica infection, or healthy controls (P < 0.02). The antibodies were of the immunoglobulin G type. No significant antibody response to the other 74 Klebsiella serotypes, noncapsulated mutants of K26, K36, and K50, or preparations of Citrobacter, Serratia, Hafnia, or Morganella spp. or Streptococcus pneumoniae could be detected. The results might suggest a specific association between these capsular types and HLA-B27+ ankylosing spondylitis and might imply their predominance in this disease.
TI  - Bacterial crude extracts or ribosomes are recognized similarly by peripheral and  mucosal B cells.
AB  - Bacterial ribosomes have been shown to induce effective humoral and cellular immunological responses to whole microorganisms. In this study, the numbers of specific antibody producing cells directed towards Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae ribosomes or whole bacteria sonicates were compared in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 7 children, and in the tonsils, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes of 10 sheep. No significant difference was noted between the two types of antigens, confirming that ribosomal preparations are able to mimic the immunogenicity of whole bacteria in the mucosae-associated lymphoid tissue.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (V). The pattern of distribution on bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from patients with respiratory infections, who were seen in six private clinics, and clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin and roxithromycin].
AB  - The pattern of distribution of bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and virus isolated from the same specimen recovered from the throat swab or the sputum of 479 patients with respiratory infections who were seen in six private clinics in Sendai City of Japan during the period from October to November in 1992 (period I) and from January to February in 1993 (period II) was documented. Of the 479 patients, 234 had acute pharyngitis, 145 had acute bronchitis, 96 had influenza, 21 had acute tonsillitis, 5 had acute pneumonia and 9 had other respiratory infections. One hundred (42.4%) strains of potential pathogen and one strain of M. pneumoniae were recovered from 236 cases in period I, and 66 (27.2%) strains of potential pathogen, one strain of M. pneumonae and 73 strains of Influenza virus (30.0%: 43 of type A Hong-Kong and 30 of type B) from 243 cases in period II. Of the 166 strains, major isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (56 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (15 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (17 strains), Esherichia coli (4 strains), Klebsiella spp. (35 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (23 strains). Only one strain of S. aureus was resistant to methicillin (MIC: 50 micrograms/ml). None of S. pneumoniae was resistant to 1 microgram/ml of ampicillin. Ciprofloxacin was administered to 113 cases and roxythromycin to 220 cases by doctors in charge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Evaluation of OPC-17116 against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract  infections.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent, against important pathogens that cause respiratory tract infections was evaluated in vitro and in vivo and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. The pharmacokinetic profiles of OPC-17116 were studied in both mice and rats given the drug orally at doses of 50 and 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. OPC-17116 showed a high degree of distribution in the lung tissues of both species, with maximum concentrations of 29.6 and 32.0 micrograms/g, respectively. Furthermore, the drug concentrations in lung tissue were about 10 to 15 times greater than the concentrations in plasma. OPC-17116 showed potent antibacterial activity against such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound for 90% of these organisms except methicillin-resistant S. aureus and P. aeruginosa ranged from < or = 0.006 to 0.78 microgram/ml. The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116 was reflected by the efficacy of a single oral dose against systemic bacterial infections in mice. OPC-17116 showed a superior effect against gram-positive bacteria, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis. In comparison with the other reference compounds, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was less than that of ciprofloxacin against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. OPC-17116 showed a greater therapeutic effect than the other drugs against experimental acute pneumonia caused by these organisms in mice or rats. This excellent therapeutic effect against respiratory tract infections may be a result of its high level of distribution in lung tissue.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefditoren against clinical isolates obtained from outpatients].
AB  - To examine the antimicrobial activity of cefditoren (CDTR) against strains clinically isolated from outpatients at this hospital from November, 1993 to February, 1994, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined including those of the control drugs. The results were as follows: 1. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs of CDTR against benzylpenicillin-insensitive or -resistant S. pneumoniae distributed in the lowest concentration range even compared to those of the control drugs. 2. CDTR showed strong antimicrobial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp. The MIC of CDTR against CEPs-resistant E. coli was lower than those of most control drugs. 3. Since the microbes described above the major pathogens for the community-acquired infections, CDTR will be effective against infectious diseases transmitted at outpatient visits.
TI  - Acute mastoiditis--revisited.
AB  - The clinical course and causative organisms were studied in 18 patients with acute mastoiditis, 13 of whom (72%) had no previous history of middle ear disease. Their age ranged from 5 months to 21 years, and duration of middle ear symptoms immediately prior to admission ranged from 1 to 45 days (average 9.7 days). None had undergone a myringotomy prior to admission, while 13 (72%) had been receiving antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media. Three were admitted with intracranial complications. Bacteria were isolated in 10 of the 16 patients in whom samples were available for bacterial culture, and included Streptococcus pneumonia (2), Streptococcus pyogenes (2), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Staphlococcus coagulase negative (2), Klebsiella pneumonia (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Of the 17 patients treated by us, 11 received surgery. Acute otitis media, secretory otitis media, acute mastoiditis, subacute mastoiditis and masked mastoiditis create a continuum. Antibiotic treatment for acute otitis media cannot be considered as an absolute safeguard against acute mastoiditis. When antibiotics are prescribed for acute mastoiditis before culture result is available, an anti-staphylococcal agent should be included. At least some patients with acute mastoiditis develop a primary infection of the bony framework of the middle ear cleft. The prevalence of the intracranial complications in acute mastoiditis is still high and may appear soon after or concomitant with the first sign of acute mastioditis.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics.
AB  - The aim of our study was to re-evaluate the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime in comparison with other oral beta-lactam antibiotics against bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. The study drugs were cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, cefprozil, and the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (= augmentin). In addition, cefotaxime as the standard agent of parenteral third generation cephalosporins was examined. The organisms tested were Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, streptococci of serogroups C and G, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of the antimicrobials were determined with the agar dilution procedure. Cefpodoxime showed the broadest spectrum and generally also the highest activity of the oral beta-lactam antibiotics examined. The drug was equally active against the major groups of beta-lactamase negative and positive bacteria causing respiratory tract infections. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, all beta-lactam agents exhibited reduced activity comparable to the reduced activity of penicillin.
TI  - Enterobacter cloacae causing pneumatocele in a neonate.
AB  - Pneumatocele formation, a cyst-like rarefaction that develops within the lung parenchyma, is an unusual complication of pneumonia in the neonate. It has been reported to occur with Staphlococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We describe a case of a premature neonate with pneumonia and subsequent pneumatocele formation caused by Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Compartmentalization of specific B-cells in sheep mucosae associated lymphoid organs.
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that Peyer's patches (PP) contribute to the seeding of other lymphoid organs in sheep. This was demonstrated by perfusing labeled lymphocytes in PP, and later investigating their presence in drainage lymph nodes, spleen, peripheral blood or bone marrow. These data showed that PP export considerable numbers of cells every day, but provided no information as to their specificity. In this work, we used the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) spot method to investigate, in the peripheral blood, mesenteric and cervical lymph nodes and tonsils from ten sheep, the numbers of specific B-cells, directed to four common bacteria of the oro-pharyngeal area of mammals: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae. The data were obtained from five sets of monozygous sheep, one animal of each pair being previously fed ribosomal preparations of these bacteria. Both prior to and after oral challenge, specific B-cells could be found in all the tissues tested. They were mostly IgG-producing cells and preferentially located in oro-pharyngeal drainage lymph nodes and tonsils. Their numbers increased in these lymph nodes after stimulation, while they decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes. These observations are consistent with the current hypothesis suggesting intestinal sensitization, proliferation and fast emigration of specific B-cells after oral challenge.
TI  - Posttraumatic meningitis: bacteriology, hydrocephalus, and outcome.
AB  - To investigate the conditions that have developed in the treatment of posttraumatic meningitis with the use of new antibiotics, the authors studied cases with this infection retrospectively for a period of 68 months. Among 860 patients with moderate to severe head injuries, 12 (1.39%) sustained this complication. Of these, nine patients (75%) had a demonstrable basilar skull fracture and seven (58.3%) presented obvious rhinorrhea. Of these seven, four (57.1%) were treated conservatively and three (42.8%) finally underwent surgery for dural repair. The infecting agents were Gram-positive cocci (Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) in five patients and Gram-negative bacilli in six patients (Escherichia coli in two, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Acinetobacter anitratus in two). In one patient, the culture results were negative. All Gram-negative strains appeared resistant to ampicillin and third-generation cephalosporins, but sensitive to imipenem and to the quinolone ciprofloxacin. Gram-positive strains were sensitive to vancomycin. Hydrocephalus finally developed in the two patients who had received intrathecal infusions of amikacin. No other report of the relation of intrathecal infusion of antibiotics and the development of hydrocephalus was found. All patients survived, indicating that, for the present, posttraumatic meningitis is a nonfatal complication of head injury.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
TI  - [Multicenter evaluation of oral antibiotics: resistance behavior in 5 Swiss centers].
AB  - The susceptibility of 2196 fresh clinical isolates to twelve different oral compounds was assessed in five Swiss microbiology institutions during summer 1992. A standardized microdilution system including all other material necessary was employed to assess the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, amoxycillin + clavulanic acid, cefadroxil, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, doxycycline, erythromycin and clindamycin. The aminopenicillins (including the beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) were highly active against the streptococci, in combination with a beta-lactamase inhibitor they covered the majority of the bla+ E. coli and Proteus mirabilis and between 60 to 80% of the Klebsiella spp. and Proteus vulgaris isolates. All the cephalosporins exhibited good activity against the streptococci, they were active against Gram-negative fermentative rods to a varying degree. Cefetamet was also active against many cefaclor and cefuroxime-resistant isolates. A considerable part of the species studied exhibited resistance to doxycycline; the observed resistance of S. agalactia, P. mirabilis, and Morganella morganii agreed with previous findings. Most of the Streptococcus spp. were inhibited by erythromycin and clindamycin. There were only single penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in the five Swiss centers. Taking account of the above particulars the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in Switzerland can be considered satisfactory.
TI  - Childhood bacteremia in Israel: causes, age relation, predisposing factors and source.
AB  - To delineate the spectrum of childhood bacteremia in a tertiary medical center in Israel and to define the historical, clinical and environmental variables that affect it, 339 bacteremic episodes were studied. Ten of the episodes (3%) were polymicrobial and 148 (44%) were hospital acquired. Staphylococcus epidermidis (17%), Staph. aureus (10%), gram-negative bacilli and Haemophilus influenzae (7%) were the most frequent etiologic pathogens. Some organisms (e.g., H. influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae) caused mainly community-acquired bacteremia, while Klebsiella sp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Acinetobacter sp. caused mainly nosocomial bacteremia. Underlying conditions were noted in 72% of the bacteremic children. A source of the bacteremia was identified in 60% of the episodes; the most common was i.v.-line infection. Age, underlying condition, source and location in the hospital markedly affected the profile of microorganisms causing childhood bacteremia. Each of these variables defined 3-5 organisms that were most prominent. In each episode of suspected bacteremia, these variables should be considered, thus defining the most likely causative pathogen(s), which should be covered by appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of minocycline and cefuzonam for antimicrobial activity against clinical isolates.
AB  - The Antibacterial activity of minocycline (MINO) and that of cefuzonam (CZON) were assessed with clinical isolates of 19 species, and compared with that of other antibiotics. MINO was highly active against methicilli-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Propionibacterium acnes, but not as effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia and Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. CZON was highly active against MSSA, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, N. Gonorrhoeae, M(B). catarrhalis, H. influenzae, H. pylori, P. mirabilis, Peptostreptococcus spp. and P. acnes, but not effective against MRSA. It was minimally active against Gram-negative rods (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) and bacteria that do not ferment glucose.
TI  - In vitro activity of CP-99,219, a novel 7-(3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl) naphthyridone antimicrobial.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CP-99,219 was compared with that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 814 clinical bacterial isolates using a microdilution method with brain-heart infusion broth. CP-99,219 was the most potent agent tested against methicillin-resistant, ciprofloxacin-susceptible staphylocci (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC]90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was 32-fold and fourfold more potent than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, respectively, against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to penicillin G and erythromycin (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). CP-99,219 was also the most potent agent tested against S. pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). The activity of CP-99,219 against Enterobacteriaceae was comparable to that of sparfloxacin, with 90% of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, C. diversus, Helicobacter pylori, and K. oxytoca being inhibited by < or = 0.5 microgram/ml. Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less susceptible, with MIC90 values to CP-99,219 of 4, 2, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Bacteroides fragilis was 0.39 microgram/ml for CP-99,219 compared with 12.5 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. CP-99,219 was highly bactericidal at 1 x to 4 x MIC against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms; its activity was similar in nutrient, trypticase soy, and cation-supplemented Mueller-Hinton broths. The spectrum and potency observed with CP-99,219 warrant further testing with this novel quinolone.
TI  - Prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the United States, I. Study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? Fluoroquinolone Resistance Surveillance Group.
AB  - Forty-three medical centers participated in a national (United States) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500 strains, 200 per laboratory). All laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips. Quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (1648), Staphylococcus aureus (1408), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), Klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). Among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against Gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against Gram-positive aerobes. Several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the United States: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly Enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (14.9%). Fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). Seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an ESBL and resistance to aminoglycosides. Clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of emerging resistant bacteria. Continued US surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize its occurrence.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of cefdinir on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyrogenes.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of a new cephalosporin, cefdinir, were determined against a range of organisms using a viable counting technique. Cefdinir exerted considerable PAEs against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, but no overall post-antibiotic inhibition of growth was detected against Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Exposure to cefdinir made the gram-negative organisms susceptible to the washing procedure used for drug removal, but this was followed by rapid recovery of viability in drug-free broth.
TI  - Characterisation of an oxidative response inhibitor produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia caused by infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae is still  a major clinical problem. Reactive oxygen species contribute to the killing of these bacteria by polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs). Defence mechanisms of Str pneumoniae which counter reactive oxygen species are characterised. METHODS: PMNs were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in the presence and absence of Str pneumoniae and supernatants from them, and superoxide (O2-) production was measured by the reduction of ferricytochrome c. RESULTS: Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not Klebsiella pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus, inhibited PMA stimulated superoxide production by PMNs. Washed PMNs which had been preincubated with Str pneumoniae autolysis phase supernatants also exhibited depressed H2O2 production in response to PMA. The inhibitory activity was not attributable to non-specific cytotoxicity as assessed by release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, nor did the supernatants inhibit PMA stimulated degranulation of PMNs. Fractionation of the autolysis phase supernatants revealed inhibitory activity in both the fractions greater than and less than 10 kD. Like pneumolysin the inhibitory activity was heat sensitive. However, both a parent and pneumolysin negative mutant Str pneumoniae, and autolysis phase supernatants from them, inhibited PMN superoxide production. Antisera to pneumolysin failed to abrogate the inhibitory effect of intact Str pneumoniae or autolysis phase supernatants from types 1 or 14 Str pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibitory effect of Str pneumoniae on the respiratory burst of PMNs is not shared by two other common lung pathogens. The existence of a novel inhibitor of the PMN respiratory burst, distinct from pneumolysin, has been demonstrated. The inhibitor is specific for the respiratory burst and is active both in the logarithmic phase of growth and during autolysis.
TI  - Antibody-producing cells in peripheral blood and tonsils after oral treatment of  children with bacterial ribosomes.
AB  - The efficacy of ribosomal preparations as mucosal immunostimulants was examined in the peripheral blood and tonsils of 14 children, before and after 28 days of oral treatment with D-53, a preparation of ribosomes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Tonsils from 10 untreated children were used as controls. Immunofluorescence and ELISAspot were performed to analyse variations in the numbers of immunoglobulin-containing and immunoglobulin-secreting B-cells. Both isotypic and antigenic specificities of these two types of cells were investigated. Significant differences were observed after treatment in the peripheral blood as well as between tonsils from treated and untreated children. In the peripheral blood a significant increase in immunoglobulin-secreting cells directed against antigenic specificities of D-53 was the major change. In tonsils, higher numbers of specific immunoglobulin-containing and secreting cells, and higher numbers of IgA-secreting cells were induced in treated children. These data support the efficacy of D-53 as an oral immunostimulant.
TI  - The etiology of community acquired pneumonia in adults in Addis Ababa.
AB  - Over a two year period, we prospectively studied 110 adult patients with Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) who presented to the Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Pneumococcal infection was diagnosed in 41% by the detection of pneumococcal antigen in sputum and other biologic fluids; in 72% by Gram stain of Lung Aspirate (LA) and in 67.5% by Gram stain of sputum. Blood and Lung Aspirate culture grew Streptococcus Pneumoniae in 4 cases (6%), Staphylococcus Aureus in 4 (6%), Enterobacteriacae in 3(5%), Pseudomonas, Klebsiella Pneumoniae and Strep. Viridans in one case each. Other non-bacterial causes included Mycoplasma Pneumoniae in 4 (4%) Influenza A in 4 (4%), Influenza B in 3 (3%) and Psittacosis/LGV in a 4 (4%). There was no case of Legionnaires disease. 39% had taken treatment before coming to hospital. The mortality was 11%. The study showed that antibiotic treatment during the preceding 36 hours did not affect the outcome of the Gram stain.
TI  - The bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. A prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  - Obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. In the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. From March 1992 to February 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. The obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. Chest ultrasound (US) and US-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. Microorganisms were isolated from seven of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. A total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, two Peptostreptococcus species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus sanguis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides species, Veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and Escherichia coli). In five cases the isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. The results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. Pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. The pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections: an open non-comparative and multicentered trial. Latin American Clinical Research Group.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and bacteriological efficacy  and safety of piperacillin-tazobactam (PT) (4g/500 mg IV tid) in the treatment of 107 adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) requiring hospitalization. Patients included were 66 men and 41 women with a mean age of 55.2 years (range 18-89), enrolled from Mexican (6) and Argentinean (5) hospitals. Ninety-nine clinically evaluable patients (92.5%), 87 with pneumonia and 12 with bronchitis, were treated for a mean period of 9.3 and 7.3 days, respectively. Response to treatment was favorable in 94.3% cases with pneumonia and 100% of cases with bronchitis; 86 cases (80.3%) were bacteriologically evaluable, 77 with pneumonia (eradication 74, persistence 1, superinfection 2), and 9 with bronchitis (eradication in all). Streptococcus pneumoniae was recovered in 24, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 21, Staphylococcus aureus in 8, Haemophilus influenzae in 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5, Enterobacter spp. in 6, Escherichia coli in 6 and other organisms in 12. Toxicity or intolerance were not observed. Our data suggest that PT is a reliable therapy for severe LRTI.
TI  - Sepsis-induced apoptosis of the thymocytes in mice.
AB  - Intraperitoneal injection of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) induces thymic atrophy in mice. The thymus weight, cell number, and viability began to decrease at 3 h, and reached their lowest level at 72 h. The thymocyte death was associated with DNA fragmentation of approximately 200 base pairs in ladder form. The kinetic study on histopathology revealed the process of thymocyte death and thymic atrophy. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that CD4+CD8+ thymocytes decreased predominantly. LPS caused thymocyte apoptosis, but only in LPS-responder mice, unlike Gram-negative bacteria that induced apoptosis in both LPS-responder (C3H/HeN) and LPS-nonresponder (C3H/HeJ). Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae also caused apoptosis in LPS-nonresponder (C3H/HeJ) and LPS-responder mice (B6). The kinetics of serum TNF-alpha production after Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria injection was slightly different. E. coli induced serum TNF-alpha peak at 1 h in B6 mice, whereas S. pneumoniae induced a peak at 6 h in C3H/HeJ and at 9 h in B6 mice. Similarly, S. pneumoniae induced thymocyte apoptosis around 9 to 12 h, which was 6 to 9 h later than that observed with E. coli in B6 mice. Anti-TNF-alpha Ab completely blocked the E. coli-induced thymocyte apoptosis, but was only partially inhibitory on the S. pneumoniae-induced thymocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, thymocyte apoptosis induced by E. coli was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. These data indicate that both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria could induce thymus atrophy via apoptosis, and that TNF-alpha is a common denominator released and might be responsible for the thymocyte apoptosis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime and flomoxef. The advantages of in vitro activity of FK037 were as follows: (1) a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, (2) the most potent activity (MIC90: 25 micrograms/ml) of the cephalosporins tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA), (3) a strong activity against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii resistant to the third-generation cephalosporins tested. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested (MIC90s) were 0.012 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pyogenes, 0.05 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, 0.1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.2 microgram/ml for Haemophilus influenzae and Proteus mirabilis, 0.39 microgram/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1.56 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Enterobacter aerogenes, 3.13 micrograms/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Moraxella catarrhalis, 6.25 micrograms/ml for C. freundii, 12.5 micrograms/ml for low-level methicillin-resistant S. aureus (L-MRSA), Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 25 micrograms/ml for H-MRSA and Serratia marcescens. FK037 was similar in potency to cefpirome against strains except MRSA, and was superior to ceftazidime and flomoxef against strains except P. vulgaris and/or M. catarrhalis. The increase in MICs of FK037 against 2 L-MRSA strains (2- or 4-fold) was smaller than that of cefpirome and flomoxef (16- to 64-fold) after the third serial culture in the presence of each drug. FK037 was highly bactericidal against S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa at the MIC or higher. FK037 had a potent protective activity against murine experimental systemic infections due to a wide variety of bacteria. Its protective activity was the strongest among the cephalosporins tested against H-MRSA and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Against the other strains, FK037 was as effective as cefpirome and similar or superior to flomoxef and ceftazidime though it was inferior to ceftazidime against P. aeruginosa. Transmission electron microscopic studies revealed that FK037 inhibited septum formation and induced thick cross walls and bacteriolysis at the division sites in MRSA after 4 h incubation.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, FK037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between January 1992 and June 1993. The MICs of FK037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for Streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for Gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for Peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for Enterococcus faecalis. FK037 was superior in potency to ceftazidime against all strains except E. faecalis, P. anaerobius and P. bivia. It was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and P. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. FK037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against MRSA, S. agalactiae and E. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except G. vaginalis and B. fragilis that were 4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to FK037.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  - Platelet concentrates (PC) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. We evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (PCD) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and long wavelength UV light (UVA) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic PC. Twelve phylogenetically distinct pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into PC to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. Contaminated PC were treated with 8-MOP (5 micrograms/mL) and 5 J/cm2 of UVA, a PCD treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. Greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of all 5 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. The remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) CFU/mL inactivated under these conditions. The inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when PC were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-MOP concentration (23.4 micrograms/mL). Illumination with 3 J/cm2 of UVA in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) CFU/mL of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (Salmonella choleraesuis, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) CFU/mL of the most resistant gram-negative organism (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This level of PCD treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. These results demonstrate that PCD using 8-MOP (5 to 23.4 micrograms/mL) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in PC with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.
TI  - Optimal times above MICs of ceftibuten and cefaclor in experimental intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The duration of time that serum drug levels remain above the MIC (time above the  MIC) for the pathogen has been shown to be the most significant parameter determining the efficacies of beta-lactam antibiotics. In the described study, we investigated the optimal time above the MIC of ceftibuten and cefaclor using a nonneutropenic mouse model of intra-abdominal infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The abilities of the drugs to protect mice against the organisms were determined in mouse protection tests, and the doses were fractionated to produce various dosing regimens with different times above the MIC. All drug-organism combinations showed a significant correlation (r > 0.9) between drug efficacy and the time above the MIC. Also, with ceftibuten treatment, the different dosing regimens that produced equal times above the MIC resulted in the same efficacy, whereas with cefaclor, an apparent dose-dependent effect was observed. These results showed that for a 100% recovery from K. pneumoniae and E. coli infections, the optimal times above the MIC with ceftibuten treatment were 2.2 and 1.6 h, respectively. Relatively high doses of both antibiotics were required to ensure recovery from S. pneumoniae infections. In vitro time-kill studies demonstrated that cefaclor exhibits a marked inoculum effect against the pathogens, and there was a concentration-dependent killing at a large inoculum size. On the other hand, ceftibuten showed no inoculum effect. It is suggested that optimization of both dose and time above the MIC appears to be necessary for the treatment of S. aureus infections with cefaclor, and this may apply to other beta-lactams tht exhibit marked inoculum effects.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefuroxime against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of cefuroxime axetil (CXM-AX) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains obtained mainly from outpatients of our center in a period from January to September of 1990 and 1993. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC80 of CXM were equal to or lower against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium acnes, except for Streptococcus pneumoniae, MIC80 which was slightly higher. 2. MIC90 of comparator drugs reflected those of new resistant organisms recently appeared, such as benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp., new quinolone-resistant H. influenzae and N. gonorrhoeae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected also from specimens of community acquired infections. From the nature of MRSA detected in those situations MRSA appeared to present a continuing problem. 3. MIC90 against strains obtained from patients with community acquired infections was a good index of increases of multidrug-resistant organisms in the past. Therefore, the determination of MIC90 is important in examining changes with time of sensitivities or resistances of clinically isolated strains to antimicrobial drugs. 4. Antimicrobial activities of CXM against recent clinical isolates showed the existence of problems as mentioned above. However, MIC of CXM as well as those of comparator drugs indicated that antimicrobial activities of CXM against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., H. influenzae appeared to be relatively strong, and it is concluded that cefuroxime axetil still is one of the clinically useful oral antimicrobial drugs in the 1990's.
TI  - Comparison of sterility profiles from slaughterhouse versus surgically removed pancreata for islet isolation with a new semiclosed method involving the COBE 2991.
AB  
TI  - Randomized comparative trial with ampicillin/sulbactam versus cefamandole in the  therapy of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  - In a randomized prospective study ampicillin/sulbactam and cefamandole were compared in the therapy of patients hospitalized with community acquired pneumonia. Patients receiving ampicillin/sulbactam (n = 37) and cefamandole (n = 38) were similar with respect to age (mean age 70 vs. 76 years respectively), clinical characteristics, severity of illness and underlying disease. Pathogens isolated from patients in the cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam group, respectively, were Streptococcus pneumoniae (7 vs. 7 patients), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (7 vs. 6 patients), Haemophilus influenzae (5 vs. 5 patients), Staphylococcus aureus (5 vs. 4 patients), Escherichia coli (4 vs. 4 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 vs. 3 patients), Enterobacter spp. (2 vs. 3 patients), Moraxella catarrhalis (1 vs. 2 patients), and organisms of the oral flora (4 vs. 3 patients). The rate of resistance to penicillin was 80%, to clindamycin 76%, to erythromycin 45%, to ampicillin 43%, and to cefazolin 18%. Overall successful treatment rates of 81% for cefamandole and 97% for ampicillin/sulbactam (p = 0.05) were observed. Both cefamandole and ampicillin/sulbactam were shown to be effective agents for therapy of community acquired pneumonia; however ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated superior overall clinical efficacy.
TI  - Formation of B-vitamins by bacteria during the soaking process of soybeans for tempe fermentation.
AB  - The formation of B-vitamins (nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, thiamine, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12) during the soaking of soybeans by bacteria, isolated from tempe, was investigated. Among the isolates examined no vitamin B6 producer was found. After inoculation of the soaking soybeans with Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Streptococcus spp. the concentrations of vitamin B12 increased significantly. For the first time it was found that soakings inoculated with C. freundii showed an increased vitamin B12 content. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were produced by Lactobacillus spp. and C. freundii. C. freundii synthesized thiamine as well.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia in adults in Addis Abeba: etiologic agents, clinical and radiographic presentation.
AB  - We prospectively studied 110 adult patients coming to Black Lion Hospital between August 1987 and July 1989 with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) for various etiologic agents and clinical and radiographic presentation. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common offending pathogen in 72% and 67.5% from sputum and lung aspirate (LA) Gram stain respectively, and in 41% by pneumococcal serotyping of sputum. Blood and LA culture grew Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4 (6%), Staphylococcus aureus in 4 (6%), Enterobacteriaceae in (3%), Pseudomonas, Klebsiella and Streptococcus viridans in one case each. Non-bacterial pathogens included Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3 (3%), Influenza A in 4 (4%), Influenza B in 3 (3%) and psittacosis/LGV in 4 (4%). Fever, cough, chest pain, tachypnea and coarse crepitations/bronchial breathing were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. Thirty per cent had associated diarrhoea and vomiting initially and 9% had altered state of consciousness at admission. Six patients came in a state of shock. Thirty-nine per cent had underlying illnesses. Ninety-three per cent had either segmental or lobar consolidation. Parapneumonic effusion occurred in 14%. The mortality was 11%. Tachypnea, the presence of underlying illness, altered state of consciousness, extreme leucocytosis and the presence of bilateral and multilobar lung involvement were found to be signs of poor prognosis. Our finding is similar to those from other African countries, except that we are reporting psittacosis/LGV for the first time in Africa.
TI  - Cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - Cefuroxime is the first commercially-available second-generation cephalosporine to be widely used in therapy; it is a semi-synthetic cephalosporin obtained from the 7-cephalosporanic acid nucleus of cephalosporin C. Cefuroxime axetil is the acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime. The majority of micro-organisms associated with respiratory infections are highly sensitive to cefuroxime. These include Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and the other streptococci (excluding group D streptococci), and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria sensitive to cefuroxime include the enterobacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Salmonella and Shigella and Straphylococcus aureus (methicillin-sensitive strains). The pharmacokinetic studies show that the maximum plasma concentration of cefuroxime after oral administration of 250 mg and 500 mg of cefuroxime axetil after a meal are respectively 4.6 and 7.9 mg/l. The absolute bioavailability of tablets is 68% (extremes 63-73%) after oral administration of 500 mg cefuroxime axetil. The protein binding is 33+/-5.7%. Tissue diffusion was studied in the interstitial fluid, the bronchial mucosa, the tonsils, and the bronchial secretions. Cefuroxime axetil is available as capsule-shaped tablets containing 125, 250 or 500 mg. An oral suspension dosage form for paediatric purposes is also available as granules in multidose bottles and sachets. Constitution gives a suspension containing 125 mg or 250 mg cefuroxime (as cefuroxime axetil). Cefuroxime axetil is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Indications include: lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., acute and chronic bronchitis and pneumonia); upper respiratory tract infections (e.g., ear, nose and throat infections such as otitis media, sinusitis tonsillitis and pharyngitis); genito-urinary tract infections (e.g., pyelonephritis, cystitis and urethritis, gonorrhoea, acute uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis and cervicitis); and skin and soft tissue infections (e.g., furunculosis, pyoderma and impetigo). For most infections, a dose of 250 mg twice daily is appropriate. In some urinary tract infections, 125 mg twice daily has been shown to be effective. If pneumonia is suspected or in more severe lower respiratory tract infection, doses of 500 mg bd should be used. Uncomplicated gonorrhoea has been shown to respond to a single 1-g dose of cefuroxime axetil. Adverse reactions to cefuroxime have generally been mild and transient in nature (gastrointestinal disturbances, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting).
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates in south Sweden including a 13-year follow-up study of some respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - The antibiotic susceptibility of consecutive isolates of the upper respiratory tract pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus, (100 strains of each species collected each year during March through April 1985, 1988 and 1992) to penicillin V, amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, doxycycline, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole was investigated by MIC determination on PDM and PDM II agar. The MICs of the upper respiratory isolates from 1992 supplemented with 100 isolates each of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus saprophyticus collected during 1992 were determined against the above antibiotics plus cefadroxil, cefpodoxime, roxithromycin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and BAY Y 3118. Beta-lactamase production was found in 10% of H. influenzae and 80-90% of S. aureus and B. catarrhalis in 1992. Among H. influenzae isolates, non-beta-lactamase-induced resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics was first detected in 1988 and amounted to 3% of isolates in 1992. Decreased susceptibility of S. preumoniae to penicillin (> or = 0.12 mg/l), co-trimoxazole > or = 32 mg/l, doxycycline (> or = 2 ml/l) and erythromycin (> or = 1 mg/l) was detected in 11%, 7%, and 8%, respectively, in 1992, which is significantly higher than in previous years at the same laboratory. Decreased susceptibility of S. pyogenes to doxycycline and erythromycin was detected in 11% and 9% in 1992. The two most recently developed antibiotics, cefpodoxime and BAY Y 3118, showed high antibacterial activity. The study emphasizes the need to screen for resistance mechanisms such as beta-lactamase production and lowered penicillin affinity.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefdinir (FK482) and ten other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated from adult and pediatric patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefdinir, an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin was compared with that of cefixime, cefpodoxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, oxacillin, ampicillin, vancomycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole against 279 gram-positive and gram-negative recent clinical isolates from adult and pediatric patients. Cefdinir was the most active drug among the cephalosporins against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90 0.015-2 mg/l). Cefixime was the most active agent against Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris (MIC90 < 0.015-0.125 mg/l). The activity of cefpodoxime was better than that of cefixime against S. pneumoniae and oxacillin-sensitive staphylococci (MIC90 0.25-8 vs. 0.5-32 mg/l), similar to cefixime against S. pyogenes (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) and not as good as cefixime against H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, Klebsiella spp. and Proteus spp. (MIC90 < 0.015-0.25 vs. 0.125-0.5 mg/l). The activity of cefdinir was greater than that of the other cephalosporins against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90 16-32 vs. > 64 mg/l). None of the cephalosporins were active against methicillin-resistant, coagulase-positive or -negative staphylococci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 > 64 mg/l). Overall, the susceptibilities of adult and pediatric isolates were similar. Kinetic kill curves demonstrated rapid and similar killing at 6 h by cefdinir, cefixime, cefpodoxime and ofloxacin. At 24 h at 1 x MIC, the least regrowth was observed with cefdinir and cefpodoxime; at 2 x MIC, suppression of growth was similar with all four drugs.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - The effects of intravesical pretreatment with pentosan polysulfate on the bacillus Calmette-Guerin induced immune reaction of the guinea pig.
AB  - Immunotherapy with intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is an effective treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. In the present study the BCG-induced immunological reaction in the guinea pig (PPD skin test, bladder wall infiltrates and number of cells in the iliac lymph nodes) was investigated after intravesical pretreatment with pentosan polysulphate (PPS), which modulated BCG attachment to the bladder wall. Pentosan polysulfate is a molecule comparable to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the bladder mucosa. The data obtained after six weekly instillations of BCG-RIVM (5 x 10(6) - 5 x 10(7) cfu) with or without preinstillation with PPS (10 mg. in 1 ml. for 0.5 hour) suggested an elevation of the immunological reaction to intravesical BCG. A strong binding capacity of PPS to the mammalian bladder wall was observed. In addition, and in contrast to bacteria commonly causing cystitis, a significant binding of PPS to mycobacteria was found: 3.5, 3.6 and 3.1 micrograms./ml. dry weight of BCG Connaught, RIVM and Pasteur, compared with 0.2, 0.3, 0.7 and 0.0 microgram./mg. dry weight of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus. The results suggest that PPS enhances the attachment of BCG to the bladder wall, resulting in an increased BCG-induced immunological reaction in the guinea pig. It may be speculated that pretreatment with PPS may increase the efficacy of BCG therapy in man, especially in those patients not exhibiting an immunological reaction.
TI  - Immune response in the lungs following oral immunization with bacterial lysates of respiratory pathogens.
AB  - We have investigated the local immune response of the BALB/c mouse respiratory tract after oral immunization with a bacterial lysate of seven common respiratory pathogens. After two immunization on five consecutive days, we examined the immunoglobulin (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgM, and IgA) secretion rates of cells isolated from the lungs and compared them with those of spleen cells of orally immunized and nonimmunized animals by using a new test system based on time-resolved fluorescence. The procedure followed the principle of the classical ELISPOT test with nitrocellulose-bottomed microtiter plates, but europium (Eu3+)-linked streptavidin rather than enzyme-conjugated streptavidin was used, with the advantage of quantifying secreted immunoglobulins instead of detecting single antibody-secreting cells. Lymphocytes isolated from the lungs of treated animals revealed significant increases in total and antigen-specific IgA synthesis compared with the rates of the controls, whereas IgG and IgM production rates showed no remarkable differences. In addition, the sera of treated mice revealed higher antigen-specific IgA titers but not increased IgM and IgG levels. We conclude that priming the gut-associated lymphoid tissue with bacterial antigens of pneumotropic microorganisms can elicit an enhanced IgA response in a distant mucosal effector site, such as the respiratory tract, according to the concept of a common mucosa-associated immune system.
TI  - Interaction between antibiotics and antineoplastic drugs on antibacterial activity in-vitro - estramustine phosphate sensitizes pneumococci to amikacin.
AB  - The antibacterial and interactive effects of doxorubicin, cisplatin, cytarabine,  vincristine, carmustine, mitoxantrone, methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, DTIC, mitomycin, etoposide and estramustine phosphate on the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, piperacillin, ceftazidime, imipenem, trimethoprim, amikacin, tetracyclin, oxacillin, metronidazole, 5-FC, and amphotericin B were studied on 57 bacterial strains. The bacterial species investigated were Escherischia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The antineoplastic drugs were diluted in Muller-Hinton agar on which the bacteria were propagated. For the susceptibility tests standard antibiotic paper discs were used and results were confirmed with the PDM epsilometer test. Seven of the fourteen cytostatic agents displayed an intrinsic antibacterial effect. A most striking interactive effect was seen in the situation where estramustine phosphate caused a marked increased sensitivity of pneumococci to amikacin, a drug to which they are regularly completely resistant.
TI  - Nutritional profile and antimicrobial spectrum of the spice Aframomum danielli K. Schum.
AB  - The spice, Aframomum danielli, on a wet weight basis with a moisture content of 10.5%, protein content of 8.2% (dry matter basis) and caloric value of 469.7 kcal/100 g, contains in varying amounts, minerals like calcium, magnesium, sodium, manganese, phosphorus, zinc and copper. Amino acids found in varying concentrations in A. danielli include L-Threonine, L-Serine, L-Valine, L-Proline, L-Glutamic acid, glycine, L-Leucine and L-Lysine. Using minimum inhibition zone of 20-22 mm in diameter, A. danielli inhibited the growth of Salmonella enteriditis, Psudomonas fragi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. ochraceus and A. niger. The minimum concentration (MIC) determined for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1 in 320 whilst the MIC for S. aureus was 1 in 8,000.
TI  - [Bacterial endophthalmitis].
AB  - Bacterial endophthalmitis is generally considered to be the most severe and vision-threatening form of ocular infection. It may follow ocular surgery, trauma or microbial keratitis, -exogenous endophthalmitis-, or derived from a blood borne organism-endogenous endophthalmitis. The most common organisms causing exogenous endophthalmitis were gram positive bacteria, including Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococcal species. On the other hand, endogenous cases were mainly due to gram negative bacteria, including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial agents should be chosen based on the usual sensitivity of known or suspected pathogens. Aminoglycosides are almost universally used, combined with cephems and fluoroquinolone topically, subconjunctivally, parenterally and intravitreally. Vancomycin is applied in MRSA infection. In severe cases, vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, corticosteroid are performed most effectively.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefodizime, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefodizime and two comparative cephalosporins, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone were studied against respiratory pathogens. MIC90s of cefodizime were 0.06-0.512 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. MIC50s of cefodizime for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were 2 micrograms/ml and 8 micrograms/ml respectively. Cefuroxime and ceftriaxone at a concentration of 2 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml inhibited 50% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 50% of Staphylococcus aureus strains studied respectively. Cefodizime inhibited many of the important respiratory pathogens and can be suggested as an active antimicrobial agent for respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Survey of bacteraemia in a Spanish hospital over a decade (1981-1990).
AB  - The aetiology, epidemiology and in-vitro antibiotic susceptibility of bacteraemic isolates in a Spanish hospital, over a decade (1981-1990), were reviewed. A total of 4363 possible episodes were microbiologically confirmed (incidence: 15.7 cases per 1000 admissions). A slight increase in the number of Gram-positive cocci and anaerobes over the last 4 years was found. The most frequent species (annual range) were: Escherichia coli (13.5%-18.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.5%-17.8%), Klebsiella spp. (3.0%-9.4%), Enterococcus faecalis (3.0%-8.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.5%-5.8%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.8%-5.6%). Males were more affected than females (ratio 1.7:1). The portal of entry was known in 2126 episodes, of which the most frequent were urinary and gasto-intestinal tracts (24.4% and 19.4% respectively). Bacteraemia was associated with rapidly and ultimately fatal underlying diseases in 7.2% and 15.1% of the cases respectively. The hospital location of patients was: medical ward 46.0%, surgical ward 22.7%, paediatric ward 16.9%, and intensive care unit 14.4%.
TI  - Comparative crossover assessment of serum bactericidal activity and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
AB  - The study compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin in 12 healthy male volunteers with normal renal function. Each volunteer received oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg, intravenous (i.v.) ciprofloxacin 400 mg, oral ofloxacin 400 mg, or i.v. ofloxacin 400 mg in a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with a one-week 'washout' period between doses. Mean peak serum concentrations were 4.48 and 5.44 mg/L for i.v. ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, respectively. For the oral regimens, mean peak serum concentrations were 2.45 mg/L for ciprofloxacin and 4.44 mg/L for ofloxacin. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) and serum bactericidal activity (SBA) for each drug were measured against five strains of each of the following species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, using the microdilution method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Ciprofloxacin was more active in vitro than ofloxacin against the tested species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, while ofloxacin was slightly more active against A. anitratus. MBCs for the two drugs were similar for H. influenzae and S. aureus. Oral and i.v. ciprofloxacin in the doses given resulted in nearly equivalent SBA. Similarly, oral and i.v. ofloxacin had nearly equivalent SBA. For the i.v. and oral regimens of both agents, peak SBA was > or = 2 throughout the 12-hour test period against the Enterobacteriaceae and H. influenzae. At peak concentrations, both drugs had modest SBA against P. aeruginosa, A. anitratus, and S. aureus but little or no activity 8 and 12 h after dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - Microbiology and management of otitis media.
AB  - Otitis media is a complex and multifactorial condition with four defined stages:  myringitis, acute otitis media, secretory (serous) otitis media and chronic otitis media. Drugs utilized in its treatment are antihistamines, decongestants, mucolytic agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, corticosteroids, vaccine therapy and antibiotics. The rationale for using antibiotics is that inflammation has been associated with the presence of virulent bacteria in all types of otitis media. In acute otitis media the major organisms, present are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In chronic otitis media these organisms, plus Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobic bacteria are all prevalent. The microbiological flora of the middle ear in secretory otitis media is almost identical with that in acute otitis media. Empirical therapy can be given in most instances of acute and serous otitis media. However, in cases of failure, in the immunocompromised and in instances of chronic otitis media, establishing the individual microbiology of the inflamed middle ear is very helpful. The growing resistance of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis to amoxycillin, due to beta-lactamase production, increases the risk of treatment failure of acute and serous otitis media. By adding a beta-lactamase inhibitor (clavulanic acid) to amoxycillin, or using second-generation cephalosporins, clearance can be achieved. Management of chronic otitis media requires surgical correction, drainage and coverage of anaerobic bacteria with agents such as amoxycillin plus clavulanic acid, or clindamycin plus antimicrobials against other pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. where present.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced antistaphylococcal activity and beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - Cefdinir (FK482), a new oral cephalosporin with enhanced beta-lactamase stability, was tested by microbroth dilution against respiratory, urogenital, and skin and skin-structure bacterial pathogens. Included were beta-lactamase (beta LAC)-producing and -nonproducing isolates. Activity was compared with that of other orally administered beta-lactams. Cefdinir minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates MIC90s (microgram/ml) were < or = 0.5 versus beta LAC+/oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus, aureus, S. epidermidis, and S. saprophyticus; < or = 0.06 versus Streptococcus groups A and B, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae beta LAC+; 0.125 versus S. pneumoniae penicillin-susceptible and Proteus mirabilis beta LAC+; 0.25 versus beta LAC+ versus strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca; 0.5 versus Haemophilus influenzae beta LAC-; 1 versus H. influenzae beta LAC+; 4 versus Legionella pneumophila beta LAC+; and 8 versus Enterococcus faecalis beta LAC-strains. Cefdinir was equally effective against both standard and high inocula of S. aureus strains producing A, B, C, or D beta LAC types. MICs were also generated versus quality-control reference strains.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of cefepime in vitro.
AB  - Cefepime is a new parenterally active fourth-generation cephalosporin which is undergoing in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Using the standard agar dilution method we compared the in vitro activity of this drug with other cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli (98 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (99 strains), Acinetobacter spp. (24 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (98 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (108 strains), Staphylococcus aureus (100 strains), Enterococcus spp. (45 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (group A; 19 strains) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B; 36 strains). Cefepime showed excellent activity against E. coli and K. pneumoniae, inhibiting 90% of these isolates at 0.12 mg/l. The in vitro activity of cefepime was superior to or comparable to the third-generation cephalosporins tested but was inferior to ciprofloxacin against Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Against H. influenzae, whether or not the strains produced beta-lactamase, its activity was similar to comparable drugs. All 84 isolates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime whereas, like other cephalosporins, it had little activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 45 enterococci isolates tested, 44.4% were inhibited by 8 mg/l of cefepime. Against streptococci, its activity was superior to any drug tested. This in vitro study indicates that cefepime has the potential to be a valuable agent for the treatment of community- and hospital-acquired cutaneous, respiratory and urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia by pristinamycin (Pyostacine 500). Results of a non comparative open study].
AB  - Activity of natural streptogramin (NSG) appears well adapted to pathogens responsible for CAP. The goal of this multicenter pilot study was to bring first data about efficacy of NSG in treatment of CAP. PATIENTS METHOD: Ten days of a NSG (1 gr b.i.d. or t.i.d.) regimen was administered to 46 hospitalized adult patients for CAP defined with fever > 38 degrees C, respiratory symptoms and X-ray opacity. Severely ill patients were excluded. A broncho-pulmonar sample (expectoration or trantracheal aspiration or protected distal sample) was performed in all patients. RESULTS: two patients were excluded because of pulmonary embolism (n = 1) or tuberculosis (n = 1) and 44 patients were analyzed. 50% of them had associated disease, 20% had failure of prior antibiotherapy. At inclusion, mean fever was 39.2 +/- 0.7 degrees C, respiratory rate was 22 +/- 5/mn, PaO2 was 74 +/- 10 mmHg, chest X-ray showed bilateral opacity in 16%, unilateral in 84% and pleural fluid level in 6 cases. Etiological diagnosis was determined in 70% of cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 14), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 5), Legionella pneumophila (n = 2), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 2) and Chlamydia psittaci (n = 1) were the most frequent isolated pathogens. 40 patients (91%) were cured with NSG and delay to obtain apyrexia was 4.4 +/- 3.9 days. NSG was stopped in 4 patients: 1 clinical and bacteriological failure (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 2 clinical failures (1 pneumococcus with purulent pleurisy, 1 pneumococcus with worsening of respiratory status), 1 patient with resistant H. influenzae strain in spite of favourable clinical evolution. NSG was well tolerated in 86% of patients. CONCLUSION: these data invite to carry on evaluation of first line therapy of CAP with NSG.
TI  - Rabbit CAP18 derived peptides inhibit gram negative and gram positive bacteria.
AB  - CAP18 (cationic antimicrobial protein of 18 kDa) was originally isolated from rabbit granulocytes using as an assay the agglutination of Re-lipopolysaccharide coated erythrocytes. The C-terminal 37 amino acids of CAP18 comprise the LPS-binding domain called RNIP, reactive nitrogen inhibitory peptide. Synthetic RNIP has broad antimicrobial activity versus both gram positive [IC50 = 130-200 nM] and gram negative bacteria [IC50 = 20-100 nM). Susceptible strains include Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Antimicrobial activity is highly dependent upon peptide structure. Although a 32 amino peptide resulting from truncation of five amino acids from the C terminus of RNIP is highly active, other fragments of RNIP including truncation of its N-terminus do not exhibit antimicrobial activity. Unlike previously characterized antimicrobial peptides derived from granulocyte proteins RNIP is active in serum. RNIP or a derivative peptide may have therapeutic potential for bacterial sepsis.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration and in-vitro activity of loracarbef, a beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of loracarbef in plasma and a mild inflammatory exudate were studied in human volunteers. After a single oral dose of 400 mg, a mean maximum drug concentration (Cmax) of 17.8 mg/L was achieved in the plasma at 1.2 h (mean Tmax). The mean plasma elimination half-life (T1/2) was 1.3 h. In the inflammatory exudate the mean Cmax was 8.9 mg/L at a mean Tmax of 2.0 h and with a mean T1/2 of 1.7 h. The mean penetration into the inflammatory exudate was 90.1%. The in-vitro activity of loracarbef was determined against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90s of 4 mg/L and 1 mg/L respectively, regardless of beta-lactamase production), as well as Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 of 2 mg/L). Loracarbef was also active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC90s of < or = 2 mg/L). The in-vitro activity and pharmacokinetics of loracarbef suggest that it would be efficative therapy for patients with community-acquired respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by the most frequently-encountered bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical experience with S-1108 on bacterial infection in the pediatric field].
AB  - The effects of S-1108, an orally active cephem antibiotic newly synthesized by Shionogi Res. Lab., on pediatric bacterial infections was studied. S-1108 was administered orally at a daily dose between 9.3 and 12.4 mg/kg in three divided doses (after each meal) for 5 to 11 days to patients with pharyngitis (2), tonsillitis (1), bronchitis (3), pneumonia (1), lymphadenitis (1), enteritis (1) and cystitis (1). The clinical efficacy rate was 100% with excellent responses in 3, good in 6 and undetermined in 1. Bacteriological effects observed indicated that one strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae and two strains of Haemophilus influenzae were eradicated by the treatment. No clinical side effects and laboratory test abnormalities were observed at all in this study. These results suggested that S-1108 would be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - Induction of the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes by Bacteroides fragilis: its possible role in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
AB  - The presence of anaerobic bacteria, especially of Bacteroides (B.) fragilis, in abdominal abscesses, infected decubitus ulcera, and the infected foot of diabetic patients is well documented. The importance, however, of these microorganisms in the pathogenesis of deep tissue infections has still to be evaluated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potency of B. fragilis as compared to aerobic bacteria widely known for causing inflammation, in inducing the release of prostaglandin E2 from polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Prostaglandin E2 is a potent vasodilator and contributes to edema and erythema, which are part of the inflammatory response. Furthermore, the cAMP-content of the neutrophils was determined after stimulation of the cells with the various bacteria. Of the bacterial species tested, B. fragilis proved to be one of the most potent triggers for prostaglandin E2 release from neutrophils indicating a possible major role of this microorganism in the pathogenesis of mixed infections.
TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of bronchoalveolar lavage and protected catheter brush methods for isolating bacteria from foals with experimentally induced pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - One indication for referral of horses to veterinary hospitals is for diagnosis of the microbiologic cause of pneumonia, particularly when the initial treatment fails. Although endoscopic methods have long been available for microbiologic sample collection, accuracy of these methods under these conditions have not been studied in detail. We compared the bacteria isolated from samples obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with those obtained by protected catheter brush (PCB) from foals with unilateral pneumonia induced by inoculation with Klebsiella pneumoniae. As part of previously described clinical trials, foals were administered antimicrobial therapy IM (n = 15) or vehicle IM (n = 7), and collection of distal airway secretion samples was conducted during the treatment period. Sensitivity and specificity of the sample collection methods were assessed by comparison of the isolates from BAL or PCB samples with isolates from tissue of the inoculated lung lobe, which was the most severely affected lung region. Sensitivity and specificity of BAL for recovery of K pneumoniae (challenge strain) and Streptococcus zooepidemicus (common secondary pathogen) was 90 and 69%, respectively, compared with 76 and 85%, respectively, for the PCB method. Sensitivity was significantly (P = 0.03) higher for BAL (100%) than for PCB (69%) for recovery of K pneumoniae (P = 0.03) from lungs. However, difference in the sensitivity of these methods for recovery of S zooepidemicus was not significant. In conclusion, BAL was a more reliable method for recovery of bacteria from the lungs in chronically infected foals that received antimicrobial treatment.
TI  - Suture abscesses after penetrating keratoplasty.
AB  - Eighteen suture abscesses that developed after penetrating keratoplasty in 15 patients were reviewed. The time from keratoplasty to the diagnosis of an abscess ranged from 1 to 53 months with a mean of 21.5 months. In 13 of the 18 cases, the patient was taking topical steroids at the time of diagnosis. All were culture-proven bacterial ulcers, except for one case that had a positive Gram's stain, but no growth on culture. The organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidemidis (six eyes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (five eyes), Sta. aureus (four eyes), Str. viridans (two eyes), Klebsiella oxytoca (one eye), Serratia marcescens (one eye), Moraxella sp (one eye), and Escherichia coli (one eye). The offending suture was removed in all cases, and the eyes were treated with topical fortified antibiotics (cefazolin and tobramycin). After treatment, 67% (12 of 18 eyes) had clear grafts, 17% (three of 18 eyes) were scarred, and 16% (three of 19 eyes) had failed grafts. Intensive topical steroid therapy was used when a subsequent graft rejection developed. Retained sutures following corneal transplants can result in sight-threatening infections and should be considered for removal as soon as the wound is well healed.
TI  - Bacterial lysates and ribosomes as inducers of specific immune responses: a comparative study.
AB  - A bacterial lysate (OM-85 BV), a preparation of purified bacterial ribosomes (D53) and a placebo were tested for ability to induce the local appearance of specific antibody-containing cells. The three compounds were given orally to 90 children who required tonsillectomy. Surgery was carried out after 1 month of therapy. Frozen-cut sections of each tonsil were tested in indirect immunofluorescence. Cells containing antibodies directed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae were enumerated. Lowest values were noted in the placebo group. Slightly higher numbers were observed after treatment with OM-85 BV, but significant increases were noted only for the elevated numbers of specific antibody-containing cells observed after D53 therapy. Bacterial ribosomal preparations thus contribute efficient induction of specific local immune responses in man.
TI  - Adverse perinatal outcome and resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes and group B streptococcus carriage.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a case series of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with  resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and group B streptococcus. METHODS: Maternal and neonatal records were reviewed of four cases in which adverse perinatal outcomes occurred from resistant Enterobacteriaceae after antibiotic usage for either PROM or positive group B streptococcal cultures. Information on clinical setting, antibiotic usage, maternal and neonatal complications, and maternal and neonatal cultures was noted. RESULTS: All four cases were complicated by PROM at 25-35 weeks' gestation. Ampicillin or amoxicillin was used in several clinical settings, including therapeutically for the presence of group B streptococcus, presumptively for PROM, and prophylactically pending the results of group B streptococcal cultures. Clinical chorioamnionitis subsequently developed in all four cases, and in two cases the maternal course was prolonged and complicated by persistent fever and the need for therapy for pelvic vein thrombophlebitis. Two neonates died from fulminant clinical sepsis. A third infant, one of a twin gestation, was stillborn, presumably because of sepsis. In three cases, neonatal and placental cultures revealed Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin; in the fourth case, Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified, with only intermediate sensitivity to ampicillin. CONCLUSION: Resistant Enterobacteriaceae associated with adverse perinatal outcomes may result from the use of antibiotics, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, after PROM. In deciding whether antibiotic therapy for PROM or group B streptococcal prophylaxis is appropriate, the value of purported benefits must be weighed against presumably infrequent but serious outcomes, including neonatal sepsis and death due to selection or overgrowth of resistant organisms.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - In order evaluate antimicrobial activities of cefodizime (CDZM), minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of CDZM and other control drugs were determined against various clinical isolates, that were sent to our center from nation-wide medical institutions or were isolated and identified in our laboratory from various specimens of infected patients. The followings are a summary of the results: 1. Bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cephems including CDZM included Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter diversus, most of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Some strains of Klebsiella oxytoca were resistant to cephems increases in beta-lactams resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and cephem resistant Escherichia coli seemed likely. Among Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. belonging to a category of so-called "mildly toxic bacteria", high portions of the strains examined were resistant to cephems including CDZM and these strains were also resistant to new quinolones, thus they showed multiple drug resistance. 2. MIC90's of CDZM against Streptococcus spp., H. infleunzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. mirabilis, frequently found in daily treatment of infections, were less than < or = 0.025 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. This indicates that CDZM would be expected to have enough antibiotic activity in infections caused by above mentioned bacteria. However, cautions are needed in the treatment of infections by beta-lactam resistant S. pneumoniae, cephem resistant E. coli and cephem resistant K. oxytoca with CDZM. 3. Among the above mentioned "mildly toxic bacteria", many multiple drug resistant strains exist. Therefore, we evaluated an usefulness of concomitant use of CDZM with aminoglycosides in the treatment of infections by these bacteria, using other reports which indicates the usefulness in vitro and in vivo. 4. Antibacterial activities of CDZM we observed in this study seem to indicate that CDZM concentrations in infected areas are maintained at above MIC levels for relatively long periods of time.
TI  - Ultrasonographic study in meningitis.
AB  
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid osmolal changes in bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Sixty children with acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) were prospectively studied for their serum sodium values and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), serum and urinary osmolality. The results have been compared with 20 age and nutritionally matched controls. Even though mean serum osmolality (283.2 +/- 13.84 mOsm/kg) and serum sodium levels (130.5 +/- 8.15 mEq/L) were significantly lower in ABM in comparison to controls (p < 0.05 and < 0.001, respectively), the overall mean CSF osmolality in patients with ABM (282.5 +/- 12.3 mOsm/kg) was not significantly different as compared to controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mOsm/kg). As expected, cases of ABM with syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) had significantly lower CSF osmolality (272 +/- 9.42 mOsm/kg) as compared to those without SIADH (288.5 +/- 9.34 mOsm/kg) and controls (288.2 +/- 7.89 mOsm/kg). However, our observations indicate that whereas the mean CSF osmolality was lower than the serum osmolality in the control group as well as in ABM without SIADH, it was greater than serum osmolality in ABM with SIADH (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that in the presence of SIADH, hypo-osmolality of serum may eventually result in hypo-osmolality of CSF, but the fall in CSF osmolality is not of the same degree as that of serum. Low CSF osmolality was observed to be associated with an unfavorable prognosis (p < 0.05).
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infants and children in southern Taiwan: emphasis on Haemophilus influenzae type B infection.
AB  - During a four-year period from November 1988 to October 1992, 41 cases of bacterial meningitis with a positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture and/or CSF antigen test were collected at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. The ages of the subjects ranged from 32 days to 13 years, with a median of seven months. The male to female ratio was 2.4:1. The most common causative agent was Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib, 29.3%), followed by group B beta-hemolytic streptococci (GBS, 24.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.0%), Escherichia coli (4.9%), Neisseria meningitidis (4.9%), Salmonella species (4.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.6%), and viridans streptococci (2.6%). The onset of GBS meningitis was always prior to four months of age. Of the 41 cases studied, 27 (65.9%) were aged from two months to five years; 12 (44.4%) of these had meningitis caused by Hib. Most of the cases (90.2%) had a fever as the first clinical manifestation. Ampicillin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin was effective against most of the causative pathogens. The most frequently encountered short-term sequelae were seizures (64.7%), subdural effusion (55.9%) and ventriculomegaly (44.1%). Observations on long-term sequelae are ongoing. While the case-fatality rate was as high as 33.3% in S. pneumoniae, and 25% in Hib-infected patients, the overall mortality rate was 17.1%. There is a need for greater emphasis on prevention through the use of available vaccines, including the newly introduced conjugate vaccines against Hib which are capable of eliciting immune responses in infants as young as two months.
TI  - The bacterial etiology of conjunctivitis in early infancy. Eye Prophylaxis Study  Group.
AB  - The authors conducted this study to determine the etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in early infancy. From 1985 to 1990, 630 infants enrolled in a randomized, controlled, double-masked study of eye prophylaxis were observed for 60 days after delivery for signs of conjunctivitis. The following isolates were categorized as pathogens: Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria cinerea, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Using conditional logistic regression for analysis of 97 infant pairs, the authors identified isolates categorized as pathogens almost exclusively among cases (odds ratio (OR) = 18.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3-128). Among the microorganisms which have not usually been regarded as pathogens in the etiology of infant conjunctivitis, Streptococcus mitis was the only microorganism associated with an increased risk of conjunctivitis (OR = 5.3, 95% CI 1.8-15.0). The findings concerning the species of bacteria most often associated with conjunctivitis, as well as the finding that method of delivery is unimportant, suggest that bacteria were transmitted to the infants' eyes after birth and not from the birth canal.
TI  - Bronchointerstitial pneumonia and respiratory distress in young horses: clinical, clinicopathologic, radiographic, and pathological findings in 23 cases (1984-1989).
AB  - Twenty-three foals, between 1 and 7 months old, with signs of acute respiratory distress, were examined at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH), University of California, Davis, between 1984 and 1989. Characteristic features included sudden onset of severe respiratory distress and tachypnea, cyanosis unresponsive to nasal oxygen, pyrexia, hypoxemia, hypercapneic respiratory acidosis, poor response to treatment, and histopathologic lesions of bronchiolitis and bronchointerstitial pneumonia. Seven of the 23 foals were normal before the onset of respiratory distress, 3 foals were found dead, and 13 foals were being treated for respiratory tract infections at the time of presentation. Laboratory data obtained for 13 horses showed increased plasma fibrinogen concentration (630.7 +/- 193 mg/dL), leukocytosis (18,607 +/- 7,784/microL), and neutrophilia (13,737 +/- 8,211/microL). Thoracic radiographs showed a diffuse increase in interstitial and bronchointerstitial pulmonary opacity and, in 5 foals, an alveolar pulmonary pattern of increased density was also seen. In 3 foals heavy interstitial infiltration proceeded to a coalescing nodular radiographic appearance. Microbiological culture of tracheobronchial aspirates (TBA) from 9 foals yielded bacterial growth, but no one bacterial species was consistently isolated. Microbiological culture of postmortem specimens of the lung from 6 foals yielded growth of bacteria that included Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhodococcus equi, or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. Tracheobronchial aspirates from 4 foals and lung samples collected from a further 4 foals at necropsy yielded no bacterial growth. Cultures were not taken from two foals premortem or postmortem. Virologic examination of TBA, lung tissue, or pooled organ tissue from 12 foals was negative. Viral culture of TBA from 1 foal showed cytopathic effects and positive immunofluorescence for equine herpes virus type II (EHV-II). In addition to the 3 foals that were found dead, 11 foals died or were euthanatized. Pathologic lesions were limited to the lungs in 50% of the foals; the remainder also had bowel lesions suggestive of hypoxic injury. The predominant histopathologic pulmonary lesions included bronchiolitis, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial hyperplasia, and necrosis. Many bronchioles were filled with mucoid and fibrinocellular exudate. The peribronchiolar interstitium and adjacent alveolar spaces were also infiltrated with inflammatory cells and contained proteinaceous edema fluid. Type II cell hyperplasia and hyaline membrane formation were observed in the majority of foals and in 2 foals alveolar multinucleate giant cells were also present.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [The antimicrobial activity of cefteram against recently clinically detected and  isolated strains].
AB  - In order to examine antibiotic activities of cefteram (CFTM), its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) and those of other cephem drugs were determined against clinically isolated strains received from July 1990 to June 1991 and from July 1992 to February 1993 from medical facilities throughout the country and against clinically isolated strains detected in our laboratory in samples from patients with various infectious diseases. The obtained results are summarized below. 1. No CFTM-resistant strains were found among beta-streptococci, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae or even when found, they were present in extremely low proportions. 2. It appeared that Streptococcus pneumoniae insensitive or resistant to beta-lactams, as well as cephems-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were increasing. The former included benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) of PCG-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), and the presence of the latter suggests the possibility of the existence of "Extended broad-spectrum beta-lactamase" producing strains. The MIC's of beta-lactams against the above PISP or PRSP, and against cephems-resistant E. coli tended to be high, but those of CFTM were relatively low (in most cases). 3. Proportions of strains resistant to cephems, including CFTM among Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Providencia rettgeri were high, and in addition, the existence of these cephem resistant species suggests an increase in multiple drug resistant strains that show resistance to new quinolone drugs. 4. As mentioned above, CFTM is by no means a perfect drug or utility drug and its antimicrobial activities do not cover some recent isolates with multiple drug resistance. Except problems encountered with so-called "attenuated" strains of bacteria, increases in resistance can only be observed at a level of MIC90's, and as far as MIC80's are concerned, CFTM still is as active as before and may be used in the treatment of most infections we encounter in normal medical practices.
TI  - In vitro activities of BAY Y3118, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens from respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.
AB  - BAY Y3118 was highly active against Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (except quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 0.063 micrograms/ml). For Enterococcus faecalis and Corynebacterium jeikeium, MIC90s were 4 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. BAY Y3118 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and had potent activity against Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [The antimicrobial spectrum of the action of bacteriocins and bacteriophages from Klebsiella strains].
AB  - The percentage of bacteriocin-producing and phage-producing Klebsiella strains was as follows: K. pneumoniae-10%, K. ozaenae-7%, K. rhinoscleromatis-9%. The antimicrobial spectrum of the studied inducible particler was broad and was not limited by the frames of the genus and family. Bacteriocins and bacteriophages from Klebsiella were active to Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Shigella and Proteus representatives significant in medicine. Klebocins and Klebsiella phages exhibited antagonistic effects to phytopathogenic bacteria. Some strains of Erwinia and Pseudomonas were sensitive to phages or bacteriocins from Klebsiella. Bacteriocins protected corn and tomato seeds from contamination by erwinioses agents. All cultures of Agrobacterium, Corynebacterium, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus were resistant to action of phages and klebocins. Bacteriocins from Klebsiella were assayed for their sensitivity to trypsin, chymotrypsin, lysozyme, ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease. Action of klebocins was associated with a protein component. Proceeding from data of diffusion through the disc ultrafiltration membranes molecular weight of klebocins was in the range of 30,000 and 50,000 Da.
TI  - Adult response to initial treatment with ampicillin in community acquired pneumonia in Yaounde, Cameroon.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of ampicillin as an initial therapy in 60 adult patients with community acquired pneumonia. Bacteriological etiology was obtained only in 24 (40pc) patients by microscopic examination, culture and antigen detection. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the leading causative agent identified in 15 cases. Other etiologies were Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Streptococcus pyogenes (2) Staphylococcus aureus (2), Haemophilus influenzae (1) and Moraxella catarrhails (1). Patients were started on ampicillin one gram twice daily, empirically, and treated for 10 days. There were 52(86.7pc) patients cured, two(3.3pc) patients improved and six (10pc) were therapeutic failures. The causative agents in patients with failures were: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1) and unknown in three cases. Only six of 60 patients still febrile after three days were switched to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid or cefaclor according to culture results and susceptibilities or to roxythromycin because no organisms were isolated. Side effects were observed in only one (1.7pc) patient who developed a mild skin rash. Due to its low cost and its high efficacy, ampicillin still appears to be the drug of choice in adult community acquired pneumonia in our region.
TI  - Influence of temperature and relative humidity on the survival of Chlamydia pneumoniae in aerosols.
AB  - The survival of Chlamydia pneumoniae in aerosols was investigated by using a chamber with a capacity of 114.5 liters. We injected 5 x 10(7) inclusion-forming units (IFU) of C. pneumoniae in aerosols with a droplet size of 3 to 5 microns. Samples were taken after 30 s and every 1 min thereafter. The survival of C. pneumoniae was measured at four temperatures (8.5, 15, 25, and 35 degrees C) and at three different relative humidities (RH) of 5, 50, and 95% for each temperature. The survival rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis LGV2, and cytomegalovirus were also determined at 25 degrees C and 95% RH and compared with that of C. pneumoniae. At the mentioned temperatures and RH, a rapid decrease of C. pneumoniae IFU was observed in the first 30 s. After this the decrease in the number of IFU was more gradual. The survival of C. pneumoniae in aerosols were optimal at 15 to 25 degrees C and 95% RH; it was good compared with those of other microorganisms. A lower death rate was observed only in S. faecalis. In C. trachomatis, the death rate during the first 30 s was higher than that in C. pneumoniae (85 and 53.3%, respectively). After the first 30 s, the death rates in the two organisms were identical. It was concluded that transmission of C. pneumoniae via aerosols was possible. There is probably a direct transmission from person to person, taking into account the relatively short survival period of C. pneumoniae in aerosols.
TI  - Secular trends in rates and etiology of nosocomial urinary tract infections at a  university hospital.
AB  - To examine changing trends in the microbial etiology of nosocomial urinary tract  infections, we reviewed culture data from a surveillance database for the calendar years 1982 to 1991. The overall rates of nosocomial urinary tract infections have increased significantly during the last decade from 2.63 per 1,000 patient-days to 4.35 per 1,000 patient-days (p = 0.0023). For specific isolates the rates of yeasts, Klebsiella pneumoniae and group B streptococcus have increased significantly during the last decade. The rates of Escherichia coli, Proteus species and Pseudomonas species have all decreased. Analysis of these secular trends can provide important information relating to the etiology of nosocomial urinary tract infections. It is likely that antibiotic "pressure" has influenced the microbiology of infections and that altered case-mix would explain much of the increase in rates. However, the multiple reasons for these secular trends and their precise contributions to them are unknown.
TI  - The North American component (the United States and Canada) of an International Comparative MIC trial monitoring ofloxacin resistance.
AB  - Common lots of reference MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) method reagents were used to monitor ofloxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, and 13 other drugs against 3200 recent clinical isolates in February-April 1992. Five medical centers in the United States and Canada contributed 640 strains per facility as follows: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Klebsiella spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (100 strains each); Streptococcus pneumoniae (40 strains); and Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis (20 strains each). Quality-control strains were processed concurrently, MICs recorded, and data processed at a common location. Selected ofloxacin-resistant isolates were retested at a reference laboratory to confirm resistances and determine cross-resistant patterns. Results indicate the following (a) fluoroquinolones were superior in usable spectrum of activity to other orally administered drugs (for example, cefaclor, cefixime, ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, minocycline, oxacillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); (b) ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were generally equal to gentamicin and cefotaxime against commonly isolated Gram-negative pathogens; (c) fluoroquinolone resistance was rare among enteric bacilli, pneumococci (ciprofloxacin > ofloxacin), H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis, but more common among oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and P. aeruginosa; (d) cross resistance was generally observed between ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin but was species or genus dependent; and (e) a new fluoroquinolone, levofloxacin, demonstrated promising activity against contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Management of maxillofacial infections: a review of 50 cases.
AB  - Maxillofacial infections often place the oral and maxillofacial surgeon in situations where timely decisions have to be made. These decisions can be life-saving. This study reviews 50 infections treated over a 3-year period. The results reveal rapid resolution of the infections by adhering to fundamental principles in their management: recognition of airway compromise, surgical intervention, and the administration of the appropriate antibiotic. A protocol for the management of maxillofacial infections is described.
TI  - Microbiologic contamination during dental radiographic film processing.
AB  - This study investigated microbiologic contamination of an automatic dental radiograph processor and daylight loader during a week of simulated clinical use. Pure cultures of Candida albicans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Klebsiella pneumoniae were used to contaminate 320 vinyl intraoral radiograph packets. Each end of the films was deliberately contaminated during opening. These films and 24 uncontaminated control films were processed. Daylight loader ports, inlet and outlet rollers, fixer and developer samples, and 12 processed films were cultured daily. To simulate a weekend, the processor sites were cultured during 72 hours of inactivity after the contaminated runs. The results showed that contamination of the processor and daylight loader occurred and remained even after 48 hours of inactivity. Films remained contaminated after processing. In addition, cross-contamination of films occurred in the processor.
TI  - Post-antibiotic effects of ofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either once of four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. Similar to the results obtained previously with ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin gave PAE values with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cell division of Klebsiella pneumoniae was inhibited on removal of ofloxacin, but no clear PAE was demonstrated with this species because once replication recommenced, the mean generation times of drug-treated cultures were much shorter than those of untreated controls. Therefore, although the results obtained with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin imply a consistency of PAE for 4-quinolones within a species, the response to DNA damage induced by 4-quinolones is multifaceted and species dependent. 4-quinolones inhibit both DNA replication and cell division, whilst at the same time stimulating DNA repair pathways. Thus, in some cases PAEs result from an increased post-treatment lag phase which may be followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag may be followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being shorter than those of corresponding drug-free controls. The PAE of a drug-induced lag may thus be masked by rapid cell division once growth resumes.
TI  - Sequence analysis of scrA and scrB from Streptococcus sobrinus 6715.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Streptococcus sobrinus 6715 scrA and scrB, which encode sucrose-specific enzyme II of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system and sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, respectively, have been determined. These two genes were transcribed divergently, and the initiation codons of the two open reading frames were 192 bp apart. The transcriptional initiation sites were determined by primer extension analysis, and the putative promoter regions of these two genes overlapped partially. The gene encoding enzyme IIScr, scrA, contained 1,896 nucleotides, and the molecular mass of the predicted protein was 66,529 Da. The hydropathy plot of the predicted amino acid sequence indicated that enzyme IIScr was a relatively hydrophobic protein. The gene encoding sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase, scrB, contained 1,437 nucleotides. The molecular mass of the predicted protein was 54,501 Da, and the encoded enzyme was hydrophilic. The predicted amino acid sequences of the two open reading frames exhibited approximately 45 and 70% identity with those encoded by scrA and scrB, respectively, from Streptococcus mutans GS5. Homology also was observed between the N-terminal region of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr and other enzyme IIs specific for the glucopyranoside molecule, all of which generate glucopyranoside-6-phosphate during translocation and phosphorylation of the respective substrates. The sequence of the C-terminal domain of the S. sobrinus 6715 enzyme IIScr shared significant homology with enzyme IIIGlc from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and with the C-terminal domain of enzyme IIBgl from E. coli, indicating that the two functional domains, enzyme IIScr and enzyme IIIScr, were covalently linked as a single polypeptide in S. sobrinus 6715. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene product of S. sobrinus scrB shared strong homology with sucrase from Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Vibrio alginolyticus, suggesting conservation based on the physiological roles of these proteins.
TI  - [A nationwide survey of antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibiotics in Japan (1988-1990)].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  antibacterial agents at 149 hospitals throughout Japan from September to December in both 1989 and 1990. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testings were performed according to the disk diffusion method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci showed high or moderate resistance rates to beta-lactam antibiotics, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were highly susceptible to them. Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to imipenem (IPM) and piperacillin but resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides. Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs and aminoglycosides. Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had a good susceptibility to IPM and aminoglycosides. Bacteroides fragilis was highly susceptible to IPM. IPM had strong antibacterial activity to many species of clinical isolates, including strains which were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of cefminox against recent clinical isolates].
AB  - Against main clinical isolates at our center in 1990 to 1992, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefminox (CMNX) and some other comparable cephems were determined. The results are summarized as follows. 1. As to the strains resistant to cephems including CMNX, annual increases were observed for Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive bacteria and Proteus vulgaris among Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, cephem-resistant strains of Escherichia coli were constantly isolated, and there were signs indicating that cephem-resistant strains would increase among strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. 2. The annual increases in cephem-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae and P. vulgaris may respectively reflect the recent increases in the incidence of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive strains of S. pneumoniae (PISP) and multi-drug resistant strains including oxime type cephems and new quinolones introduced into clinical use in the latter half of the 1980s. 3. Concerning antimicrobial activities of CMNX against recent clinical isolates, the same problems as described above will remain. However, these tendencies have been observed only with regard to MIC90. No remarkable changes have been noted for MIC50 or MIC80 at this time.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis and meningitis in Mallorca, Spain, 1977-1991.
AB  - In a retrospective study at Son Dureta Hospital (Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca, Spain) of the period 1977-1991, 334 cases of culture-proven sepsis and/or meningitis in neonates born at the facility were identified. Overall, there was an incidence rate of 4.9 cases per 1,000 live births. The case-fatality rate was 7.5%. Infection was more frequent in infants of low birth weight, with the exception of infants with meningitis and infections due to group B Streptococcus and Listeria species. The patterns of predominance among bacterial pathogens that were isolated changed during the period studied. From 1977 to 1984, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequent such isolate, but this frequency declined in the following years. Group B Streptococcus organisms and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and Staphylococcus epidermidis replaced K. pneumoniae as the predominant pathogens in early- and late-onset infections, respectively. The frequency with which other pathogens were isolated did not vary significantly during the study period. Invasive infection caused by Candida organisms was found in two patients. The incidence of infection due to group B streptococci has increased in the last few years (to 2.4 cases per 1,000 live births in 1991) and has become a significant problem that requires a thorough epidemiological evaluation.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of empyema. A retrospective review in two military hospitals.
AB  - The microbiology and clinical features of empyema were studied retrospectively in 197 patients whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Three hundred forty-three organisms (216 aerobic or facultative and 127 anaerobic organisms) were isolated. Aerobic bacteria were isolated in 127 (64 percent) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 25 (13 percent), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 45 (23 percent). The predominant aerobic or facultative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (70 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (58), Escherichia coli (17), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), and Haemophilus influenzae (12). The predominant anaerobes were pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species (24), Bacteroides fragilis group (22), anaerobic cocci (36), and Fusobacterium species (20). beta-Lactamase-producing organisms were recovered in 49 (38 percent) of 128 tested specimens. These included all 42 tested S aureus and 15 B fragilis group, 4 of 9 K pneumoniae, 3 of 9 H influenzae, 3 of 8 pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas species, and 2 of 6 E coli. Most patients from whom S pneumoniae and H influenzae were recovered had pneumonia, and most patients with S aureus had pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and lung abscesses. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, and lung, subdiaphragmatic, dental, and oropharyngeal abscesses. These data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema.
TI  - Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of the scrK gene encoding fructokinase of Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - A gene encoding an ATP-dependent fructokinase from Streptococcus mutans GS-5 was  identified within a 2 kb DNA fragment immediately downstream from the scrA gene. The gene cloned in Escherichia coli also expressed mannokinase activity. Insertional inactivation of this gene in S. mutans markedly decreased both fructokinase and mannokinase activities. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 2 kb fragment revealed an ORF starting 199 bp downstream from the scrA gene, preceded by potential ribosome-binding (Shine-Dalgarno) and promoter-like sequences. This ORF specified a putative protein of 293 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 31,681. The deduced amino acid sequence of the fructokinase gene, scrK, from S. mutans exhibited no significant similarity to fructokinase genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli plasmid pUR400 or Vibrio alginolyticus, but was similar to a comparable gene from Zymomonas mobilis.
TI  - Structure of the maltodextrin-uptake locus of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Correlation to the Escherichia coli maltose regulon.
AB  - The mechanism of induction of the maltose/maltodextrin regulon of the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae seems to be different to the positively controlled maltose regulons of the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium. In this work, we report on the structure of the S. pneumoniae genes involved in maltodextrin uptake malX, malC and malD. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences encoded by these genes indicate that they are homologous to the E. coli MalE periplasmic maltose binding protein and the two maltose permeases MalG and MalF. The analysis of transcription start points indicates that malXCD could be transcribed from a single consensus promoter sequence. Northern analysis of the mRNA molecules pertaining to this region reveals that the transcript encompassing all these three genes is apparently cleaved at a large putative mRNA secondary structure, yielding two mRNA molecules. The smaller of these molecules would include only the malX gene while a larger fragment spans through malC and malD. The processing of mRNA has not been reported in the Gram-negative maltose regulons, and may suggest either a less evolved or a divergent system for the control of gene expression of this regulon in S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of acute lower respiratory infections in pre-school Nigerian  children and comparative predictive features of bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic illnesses.
AB  - In a 9-month surveillance of the microbial agents causing acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in hospitalized preschool Nigerian children, 24 bacterial isolates were made from 22 (33 per cent) out of 66 blood cultures, including seven (70 per cent) of the 10 cultures from subjects with pleural effusion. Of the 24 positive isolates, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 14 (58 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae for four (17 per cent), Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus albus for two (8 per cent) each, and Haemophilus influenzae for only one case. Seven subjects had a mixed aetiology, comprising one bacteraemic case with measles and six with concomitant viral identifications. Sixteen cases, 10 (63 per cent) of whom were malnourished, had two or more pathogens, including 10 with multiple viruses. Bacterial isolates from the throat, were not significantly predictive of the ALRI aetiology. Overt malnutrition, empyema, and anaemia, were significantly commoner in bacteraemic cases (P < 0.03, 0.01, and 0.05), while rhinorrhoea and crepitations were each associated with the non-bacteraemic ones. (P = 0.05 and < 0.05). A similar association was shown between rhinorrhoea, wheezing/rhonchi and the mixed aetiological group (P < 0.05 and 0.05, respectively). The case-fatality in bacteraemic subjects, was 9 per cent and was 2.1 times higher than that for non-bacteraemic cases, in whom a shorter mean duration of admission was recorded. In developing countries, the need for periodic local surveillance of ALRI pathogens, as a prerequisite for evolving rational antimicrobial policies, is emphasized. Our findings underscore the predictive importance of malnutrition as a risk-factor of severe bacteraemic ALRI, frequently associated with multiple pathogens. The relative usefulness of blood culture in identifying bacterial agents of ALRI is discussed.
TI  - Changes in adherence of respiratory pathogens to HEp-2 cells induced by subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Preincubation with subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim decreased the adherence of the respiratory pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis to human larynx carcinoma HEp-2 cells. Subinhibitory concentrations of sparfloxacin did not change the adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae 15.62, but adhesion of S. pneumoniae 15.42 was significantly enhanced by subinhibitory antimicrobial concentrations.
TI  - Pre- & post-fumigation bacteriological surveillance of hospital environment.
AB  - Study of bacteria in the environment and surfaces of hospital wards revealed Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter species, coagulase negative staphylococci and Serratia marcescens to be the predominant bacterial isolates. Surface sampling following fumigation showed significant reduction in most of the isolates. Bacterial counts in the air also showed considerable decline. Fumigation under proper technical supervision showed significant reduction in bacterial count as compared to that carried out without such supervision. This study highlights that certain bacterial species are predominantly found in the hospital environment and emphasises the need for frequent supervisory monitoring of hospital wards.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK-037, a parenteral cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of FK-037, 5-amino-2-[[(6R, 7R)-7-[[(Z)-2-(2-amino-4-thiazolyl)-2- methoxyimino) acetyl] amino]-2-carboxy-8-oxo-5-thia-1- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-3-yl]methyl]-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1H-pyrazoli um hydroxide, inner salt, sulfate (1:1), a new parenteral cephem, was compared with those of cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. FK-037 inhibited methicillin-susceptible staphylocci at < or = 4 micrograms/ml. Of 98 isolates of homogenous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 55 (56.1%) were inhibited by 8 micrograms of FK-037 per ml, compared to 3.1% for cefepime. Imipenem was the most active beta-lactam tested against staphylococci. The MIC of FK-037 for 90% of the strains tested (MIC90) was 0.06 micrograms/ml for hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and Streptococcus bovis. The MIC90 for many of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was 1 microgram/ml, similar to that of cefepime and lower than those of ceftazidime and imipenem. The MIC90 for Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae was 8 micrograms/ml, similar to that for cefepime, but all isolates were inhibited by 2 micrograms of imipenem per ml. K. pneumoniae isolates with cefotaxime and ceftazidime MICs of > 32 micrograms/ml with Bush type 2b' beta-lactamases were inhibited by 4 micrograms of FK-037 per ml. E. cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and S. aureus stably resistant to FK-037 could be selected by repeated transfer in the presence of FK-037. The FK-037 MIC90 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 4 microgram/ml, compared to 32 microgram/ml for cefepime and ceftazidime and 8 microgram/ml for imipenem. Xanthomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter anitratus, and Bacteroides species were resistant to FK-037 (MIC, more than or equal 32 microgram/ml). MBCs were identical to or within twofold of the MICs except for a 32-fold greater MBC for P. aeruginosa. Inoculum size and acid environment did not lower the activity of FK-037. FK-037 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by Bush group 1, 2a, 2b, and 2e beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by 2b' and 2d enzymes at rates comparable to that of ceftazidime. Nonetheless, FK-037 inhibited bacteria possessing TEM-3, -5, and -7 and SHV -5 at less than or equal 8 microgram/ml. Overall, FK-037 has lower MICs against staphylococci and P. aeruginosa than the currently available iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporins and has activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae comparable to that of cefepime.
TI  - Characterization of Pseudomonas pseudomallei antigens by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot.
AB  - Immunological characterization of various Pseudomonas pseudomallei preparations was carried out by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using sera from infected humans and from patients with other bacterial infections. Somatic (SOM) and partially purified cell extracts (PCE) gave more complex SDS-PAGE patterns: M(r) ranged from 86 to 12.7 and 48 to 10 kDa, respectively. The culture-filtrated antigens (CF) from 3 different kinds of synthetic media consisted of fairly simple profiles with common bands M(r) of 40, 26 and 16 kDa. PCE and CF reacted specifically with infected human sera; SOM did not. The components with M(r) of 40 kDa in CF reacted consistently with all infected sera but failed to react with sera infected with Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri. This peptide was demonstrated to be a major component in CF thus suggesting its potential for development of immunodiagnostic methods for melioidosis.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, is an oxime-type cephem antibiotic with a  1-hydroxyethyl-5-amino-pyrazole moiety at the 3 position. FK037 was evaluated for antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, FK037 was twofold or more active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC for 90% of the strains [MIC90] = 32 micrograms/ml), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 < or = 2 micrograms/ml), group A streptococci (MIC90 = 0.015 microgram/ml), and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). In addition, the activity of FK037 was equal to or greater than that of ceftazidime, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 = 0.12 microgram/ml) and methicillin-sensitive or -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90 = 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively). FK037 was more active in vitro than cefepime (two- to fourfold) and cefpirome (twofold) against S. aureus. In murine systemic infection models, FK037 showed potent activity against P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. FK037 was also efficacious in a mouse model of pyelonephritis caused by S. aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae and in a mouse model of pneumococcal pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae. Additional studies on this compound to assess its potential clinical utility are warranted.
TI  - Immunodiagnosis of group-A streptococci by latex agglutination assays with monoclonal or monospecific polyvalent antibodies.
AB  - Seven clones of murine monoclonal antibodies specific for group-A streptococci were generated. All of them were of IgM isotypes and recognized trypsinized as well as nontrypsinized group-A streptococci and polysaccharide. These were devoid of reactivity with streptococci-B, -C, -G and Staphylococcus aureus. Polyclonal antibodies against group-A polysaccharide (APS) were also raised in rabbits by linking APS to bovine serum albumin, and rendered monospecific by adsorption. Latex agglutination assays were developed employing both types of antibodies. The assay employing monospecific polyvalent antibodies had a sensitivity of 12.5 ng APS/ml as compared to 1 microgram APS/ml for latex sensitized with monoclonal antibodies. Both assays were specific, as no agglutination was observed with polysaccharides obtained from streptococci-B, -C, -G, Staph. aureus, Cornybacterium diptheriae, Candida albicans, Candida spp., Morexella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Strep. pneumoniae. Salmonella typhi and S. paratyphi A and B. Throat swabs from children obtained in duplicate, when tested for the presence of streptococci-A, showed a good correlation of the results obtained by latex agglutination assay with the microbial culture test and serogrouping.
TI  - The microbiology of acute and chronic sinusitis and otitis media:a review.
AB  - There exists no real controversy about the role of aerobic bacteria in acute sinusitis and in acute otitis media. The "infernal trio" Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are by far the most common pathogens in these acute infections. On the contrary, there is still much debate about the normal flora of the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, although there are some reports of the presence of anaerobes and aerobes in the majority of the normal paranasal sinuses. In chronic sinusitis bacteriological cultures show a greater variation than those in acute sinusitis. Nonetheless, it is demonstrated in most studies that besides the "infernal trio" additional bacteria are present, including anaerobes and gram negative bacteria. In otitis media with effusion (OME) we find the same bacteria as in acute otitis media (AOM) and a pathologic flora in the nasopharynx seems to be important for both AOM and OME. In chronic otitis cultures are nearly always positive and reveal Pseudomonas species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus species and anaerobes.
TI  - Etiology and pathology of equine placentitis.
AB  - Placentas from aborted, stillborn, and premature foals were examined during the 1988 and 1989 foaling seasons, and 236 of 954 (24.7%) had placentitis. Microorganisms associated with placentitis were isolated or demonstrated from 162 of 236 (68.6%) placentitis cases. Leptospira spp. and a nocardioform actinomycete were 2 important, newly emerging bacteria associated with equine placentitis. Major pathogens identified in decreasing order were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Leptospira spp., Escherichia coli, a nocardioform actinomycete, fungi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus equisimilis, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus. Pathogens were not recovered in 64 cases (27.1%) and overgrowth by saprophytic bacteria was recorded in 10 cases (4.2%). Twenty-seven cases (16.6%) had mixed bacterial growth and 93 cases (57.4%) had bacteria cultured from both placenta and fetal organs. The majority of the placentitis cases caused by bacteria, with the exception of Leptospira spp. and the nocardioform actinomycete, occurred in 2 forms. One was acute, focal or diffuse; had an infiltration of neutrophils in the intervillous spaces or necrosis of chorionic villi; was associated with bacteremia; and frequently occurred in the placenta from fetuses expelled before or at midgestation. The other was observed from foals expelled at late gestation, was mostly chronic and focal or focally extensive, and occurred mostly at the cervical star area. Chronic placentitis was characterized by the presence of 1 or a combination of the following lesions: necrosis of chorionic villi, presence of eosinophilic amorphous material on the chorion, and infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells in the intervillous spaces, villous stroma, chorionic stroma, vascular layer, and allantois.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Comparison of empiric aztreonam and aminoglycoside regimens in the treatment of serious gram-negative lower respiratory infections.
AB  - An open-label, controlled, randomized study was performed to assess the efficacy  and safety of combination regimens using either aztreonam or an aminoglycoside control regimen as empiric therapy for suspected aerobic gram-negative bacillary pneumonia or purulent bronchitis. Eighty-four patients, 42 in each arm of the study, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens. The combination aztreonam regimen included aztreonam, 2 gm every 8 hours (q8h), plus either clindamycin, 600 to 900 mg q8h, or nafcillin, 1.5 gm to 2 gm every 6 hours (q6h). The control regimen was one of the following depending on the combination therapy that was designated standard at each of the three study institutions: amikacin, 5 mg/kg q8h, plus cefazolin, 1 gm q8h; amikacin, 500 mg every 12 hours plus mezlocillin, 4 gm q6h; or kinetically dosed tobramycin plus ticarcillin, 3 gm to 4 gm q4h. The two groups were well matched in terms of demographics and clinical characteristics. Among the 84 patients, organisms from the Enterobacteriaceae family accounted for the largest proportion of isolates (44%) including Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella species (14%), and Serratia species (9%). Other commonly identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19%), Haemophilus influenzae (15%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (12%), and Staphylococcus aureus (8%). Results of this trial included clinical response rates of 83% in both groups (P = 0.951) and a microbiologic cure rate of 75% in the aztreonam group and 63% in the control group (P = 0.291). In the 59 patients with documented aerobic gram-negative pneumonia, microbiologic eradication rates were 72% in the aztreonam group versus 57% in the control group (P = 0.359). Duration of treatment tended to be shorter in the aztreonam group than in the control group, with a median 10 days of therapy versus 12 days of therapy (P = 0.095), respectively. In addition, the percentage of patients requiring nonstudy antimicrobial agents tended to be lower in the aztreonam group than the control group, involving 21% of patients in the aztreonam group compared with 36% of patients in the control group (P = 0.086). All regimens were well tolerated, and no patient was withdrawn because of adverse reactions to the study medications. Two patients, both in the control group, required dose reduction, which was necessitated by possible aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. This trial shows that aztreonam is an effective agent with an excellent safety profile when used in combination regimens for the empiric treatment of pneumonia. A well-controlled trial is needed to verify the trend toward shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for additional antimicrobial agents seen with the aztreonam regimen when compared with those receiving aminoglycoside-combination regimens.
TI  - In vitro activity of clarithromycin, cefprozil, and other common oral antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Macrolide and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents are frequently used for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin or skin structure infections. To evaluate the relative in vitro activity of these antimicrobial drugs against organisms commonly involved in these infections, we tested clarithromycin, erythromycin, cefprozil, cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline against 174 gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Manual broth microdilution susceptibility testing was used with a standard inoculum of 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units/well at pH of 7.2. Clarithromycin was the most active agent against streptococci. Methicillin-susceptible S aureus exhibited resistance to both clarithromycin and erythromycin, but was susceptible to cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline. Cefprozil was at least as active as cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cephalexin against all organisms tested, but was fourfold less active than doxycycline against E coli and 16-fold less active than clarithromycin versus S pneumoniae. The gram-negative isolates tested showed resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin; however, cefprozil was as active as amoxicillin/clavulanate against K pneumoniae and E coli. These results demonstrate that clarithromycin provides superior in vitro activity against common streptococci, while cefprozil, cefuroxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and doxycycline provide greater activity against methicillin-susceptible S aureus, K pneumoniae, and E coli. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the clinical significance of these findings.
TI  - [Cefuzonam penetration into cerebrospinal fluid].
AB  - We studied the penetration of cefuzonam (CZON) into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 20 patients with neurosurgical diseases. Influences of the presence of meningeal reaction and the intensity of brain damage on CSF penetration of CZON were also examined. Concentrations of CZON in serum and CSF were determined using the thin-layer cup method before and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after 2 g of CZON was administered intravenously. The serum concentration at 1 hour was 60.4 +/- 31.3 (mean +/- S.D.) microgram/ml, then rapidly decreased to 2.1 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. In contrast, the CSF concentration gradually increased, reached a peak level of 0.319 +/- 0.313 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and then slowly decreased to 0.273 +/- 0.249 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The CSF penetration ration: CZON ([CSF]/[serum]) was 5.6% at 4 hours. The peak CSF concentration in patients with meningeal reaction (0.465 +/- 0.364 micrograms/ml at 2 hours) was about 2-fold higher than that in those without the reaction (0.249 +/- 0.223 micrograms/ml at 4 hours). The peak CSF concentrations in patients with slight, moderate, and severe brain damage were 0.231 +/- 0.133 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, 0.270 +/- 0.232 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, and 0.680 +/- 0.467 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, respectively. CSF penetration of CZON was augmented in patients with meningeal reaction or severe brain damage. These findings indicate that the concentration of CZON in CSF after intravenous administration is sufficient for treatment of meningitis or infections after neurosurgical operations caused by such bacteria as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Treatment recommendations for respiratory tract infections associated with aging.
AB  - Age-related changes, for example reduced elasticity and earlier airways collapse, predispose the elderly to respiratory infection. Other factors such as a lifetime of smoking, the use of hypnotics, or the development of stroke also predispose. Pneumonia becomes increasingly common with advancing age, and both morbidity and mortality increase with associated disease burden. Diagnosis of pneumonia may be more difficult in the aged because of physiological changes. However, careful physical examination with accurate, regular recording of body temperature will usually reveal the characteristic features of pneumonia, which should be confirmed by chest radiograph. In the frail elderly, the onset of impaired function, such as confusion, immobility, falling or incontinence, should raise suspicion of infection. Pneumonia is classified as community-acquired, nursing home-acquired or nosocomial, which helps in the empirical choice of antibiotics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common organism in the community, then Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Gram-negative organisms like Klebsiella and Escherichia coli are more common in nosocomial infections. Nursing home patients with pneumonia tend to be more frail than those in the community. Treatment is directed at eradication of the organism with the appropriate antibiotic, maintaining hydration and oxygenation, as well as managing impaired mobility, faecal loading, urinary incontinence and confusion. Influenza vaccination is strongly recommended for the frail elderly. Tuberculosis remains an important diagnosis in the frail elderly and should always be considered, especially in patients with respiratory infection who fail to respond to conventional therapy.
TI  - Contributions of post-antibiotic lag and repair-recovery to the post-antibiotic effects of ciprofloxacin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - A viable counting technique was used to determine the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of ciprofloxacin against four bacterial species, treated with either one or four times the minimum inhibitory concentration for 1 or 3 h. PAE were demonstrated with Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes after exposure to either concentration for both times. No clear PAE was demonstrated for Klebsiella pneumoniae after any treatment. In some cases, PAE was due to an increased post-treatment lag phase, which was followed by nearly normal multiplication, whereas in other cases a long lag was followed by abnormally rapid cell division, with the generation times of treated cultures being much less than those of the corresponding drug-free controls. This is evidence of recovery of cells that have completed DNA repair. S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumoniae all exhibited evidence of this type of repair even though K. pneumoniae gave no significant PAE. However, the post-treatment generation times of S. pyogenes, which produced the greatest PAE, gave no evidence of such repair. It is concluded that PAEs may result from a variety of factors.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK037, a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - FK037 has potent therapeutic activity against lethal systemic infections and experimental local infections due to a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. In murine systemic infections, FK037 was the most effective of the cephalosporins and imipenem tested against highly methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (H-MRSA). It was more effective than ceftazidime against selected strains of S. aureus and Enterobacteriaceae, except Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was as effective as ceftazidime and was as effective as cefpirome against all organisms tested, except MRSA and P. aeruginosa against which FK037 was more effective than cefpirome. These results correlated well with its in vitro activity. In murine local infections, with few exceptions, FK037 was more effective than ceftazidime and cefpirome against Klebsiella pneumonia in ED50 values and against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) subcutaneous abscess, pyelonephritis with Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, intrauterine infections with S. aureus and E. coli in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the abscess, kidneys and uterus. It is noteworthy that the therapeutic effects of FK037 were more potent than had been anticipated from its in vitro activity against local infections with staphylococci and P. aeruginosa when compared with ceftazidime or cefpirome. In addition, the therapeutic effects of FK037 were equipotent or superior to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime against pneumonia due to MSSA, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs in mice using an in vivo pharmacokinetic model simulating human plasma concentrations after drip infusion of usual clinical doses (0.25 to 1.0 g for MSSA, 0.063 to 0.125 g for K. pneumoniae and 1.0 to 2.0 g for P. aeruginosa). FK037 induced an in vivo post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.4 hours against a thigh infection with MSSA in neutropenic mice. These results strongly suggest that it has potential for clinical use against various infections due to bacteria which include staphylococci and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - [Nose and throat carriage in "food handlers"].
AB  - From December 1991 to February 1992, 450 personnel have been investigated for pathogen microorganisms in their nose and throat. The study was performed in the Infectious Diseases Section of Gulhane Military Medical Academy. Pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from 54 nose culture (12%) and 6 throat culture (1.33%). In one person pathogen microorganisms have been isolated from his nose and throat. The difference between the two groups (The nose and throat cultures) was significant at p = 0.001 by Fisher's exact test (t = 6.414). In the nose cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (85.2%), Proteus vulgaris (5.6%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.8%), Citrobacter freundii (1.8%), Group C beta-hemolytic streptococcus (1.8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.8%). Only one (1.85%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris) in his nasal culture. In the throat cultures the pathogen microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (66.7%) and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (50%). Only one (16.6%) had two different pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus) in his throat culture. The same pathogen microorganisms (S.aureus) has been isolated in an only one person's nasal and throat cultures (0.22%). We treated 60 personnel who were nasal and throat carriers according to the results of antibiograms. After treatment, two still had previous pathogen microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus). These two carriers were eradicated by repeating the treatment.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against > 500 bacterial isolates.
AB  - An agar dilution technique was used to compare the antimicrobial activities of lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enoxacin against 544 strains of bacterial isolates. Among the five quinolone agents tested, ciprofloxacin was the most active. Enoxacin was the most active after ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, and Haemophilus influenzae with an MIC90 of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ofloxacin was the most active agent after ciprofloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Legionella pneumophila with an MIC of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Ciprofloxacin inhibited Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., at < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. Norfloxacin and enoxacin had the same antimicrobial activity (MIC90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and some other Gram-positive species, but these activities were weak when compared with ciprofloxacin. The results of this in vitro study show that ciprofloxacin is very active against Gram-negative and Gram-positive species.
TI  - Importance of beta-lactamase stability in treating today's respiratory tract infections.
AB  - In respiratory tract infections Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis,  Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella spp. are the most frequently encountered bacterial pathogens. Resistance of clinical S. pneumoniae isolates is known to be independent of beta-lactamase production, whereas resistance of the other species mentioned is due to beta-lactamase production. With respect to M. catarrhalis the first beta-lactamase-producing (bla+) isolate was detected in clinical specimens in 1976 and now, 70-90% of all clinical isolates are bla+. The enzymes BRO-1 and BRO-2 are transposon-mediated thus explaining their rapid spread; they hydrolyze penicillin compounds very rapidly and, to a lesser extent, the older cephalosporins. Resistance in clinical H. influenzae isolates is mainly due to the prevalence of the most widespread transposon-mediated beta-lactamase, TEM-1, which has a substrate profile resembling that of the BRO enzymes. Bla+ H. influenzae isolates make up to 6% of the total in Northern Europe, in Southern Europe up to 55% and in many African countries more than 80%. More than 95% of Klebsiella spp. isolates possess a chromosomally encoded penicillinase and to a varying extent a plasmid-mediated enzyme in addition. Recently, reports from several countries have pointed to the clinical relevance of 'extended-spectrum enzymes' derived by point mutation from the 'classical' TEM-1 or TEM-2 enzymes. These new enzymes (TEM-3 to TEM-21) exhibit a broadened substrate profile, inactivating even the oxyiminocephalosporins. The most stable compounds are ceftibuten and cefetamet. With respect to the future, these enzymes may spread between species due to their location on transposons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [The protective activity of a multicomponent vaccine made from the antigens of opportunistic microorganisms when administered orally].
AB  - Multicomponent vaccine VP-4, prepared from Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Proteus and Escherichia coli antigens, was tested for protective activity by oral administration to mice with experimental Klebsiella, Proteus and S. pneumoniae infections. Vaccine VP-4, when introduced orally (in 2-3 administrations of 2 mg), was found to produce a protective effect with respect to K. pneumoniae (the effectiveness index was equal to 5.7 and 4.3). With respect to P. vulgaris, the effectiveness index was 2.7 (immunization was made in two oral administrations of 2 mg); in pneumococcal infection preliminary oral immunization with vaccine VP-4 in two administrations in a dose of 2-4 mg produced high protective effect. Thus, immunization with vaccine VP-4, introduced orally in comparatively small doses, proved to be effective in animal models used in the experiment.
TI  - Lomefloxacin versus amoxicillin in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: results of multinational studies.
AB  - The results of two large, multicenter studies comparing the safety and efficacy of lomefloxacin (400 mg administered orally once daily) and amoxicillin (500 mg administered orally three times daily) in adult patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens have been combined. The studies were both randomized and blinded. One study enrolled 127 patients in 12 centers in Belgium; the second enrolled 510 patients in 52 centers in ten countries. The protocols were essentially identical, whicl allowed data to be pooled. A total of 253 lomefloxacin-treated patients and 254 amoxicillin-treated patients were considered evaluable. Both groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, and severity of presenting signs and symptoms. The most common pathogens in both treatment groups were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two to four days after the conclusion of treatment, bacterial eradication rates were 85.4% for lomefloxacin-treated patients and 75.2% for patients receiving amoxicillin (p = 0.004). The clinical success rate (total of evaluable patients either cured or improved) 2-4 days after the conclusion of treatment for the lomefloxacin group was 90.9%, and for amoxicillin was 82.3% (p = 0.005). The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment groups, and no interactions were noted in those patients in both groups who received concomitant theophylline. In these studies, lomefloxacin administered once daily was superior to amoxicillin given three times daily to patients with acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis caused predominantly by Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of a single dose of ceftriaxone (1,000 milligrams intravenously) for antibiotic prophylaxis in thoracic surgery.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of ceftriaxone after a single intravenous injection of 1,000 mg to 17 patients for antibiotic prophylaxis in thoracic surgery were studied. The patients were scheduled for elective noncardiac thoracic surgery. Adequate levels in serum (higher than or equal to the MIC for 90% of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were found for all patients throughout the surgical procedures. Mean maximal (5-min) and final (24-h) ceftriaxone levels in serum were 157 +/- 42 and 8.6 +/- 4.5 mg/liter, respectively. The beta-phase elimination half-life was 8.6 +/- 3 h, the plasma clearance was 18.4 +/- 6.25 ml/min, and the apparent volume of distribution at steady state was 0.21 +/- 0.07 liters/kg. At the time of the thoracotomy, the ceftriaxone concentrations were 13.5 +/- 7.8 micrograms/g in thoracic wall fat and 27 +/- 9 micrograms/g in lung tissue. At the time of closure, the ceftriaxone concentration was 15 +/- 9 micrograms/g in thoracic wall fat. During the different steps of the surgical procedures, 100% of patients had adequate levels in tissue (higher than or equal to the MIC for 90% of isolates of Streptococcus spp., E. coli, H. influenzae, and K. pneumoniae). For S. aureus, 90 to 100% of patients had adequate tissue ceftriaxone levels.
TI  - eNAP-2, a novel cysteine-rich bactericidal peptide from equine leukocytes.
AB  - We purified a novel cysteine-rich antibiotic peptide, eNAP-2 (M(r), approximately 6,500), from acid extracts of equine neutrophils by sequential gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and determined its partial N-terminal amino acid sequence. Although its cysteine motif distinguished eNAP-2 from all other currently known endogenous antibiotic peptides, including defensins and granulins, it showed substantial sequence similarity to WDNM1, a putative member of the four-disulfide-core protein family that also includes animal and human antiproteases, snake venom neurotoxins, and rat and mouse whey proteins. The antibacterial properties of eNAP-2 were tested against several equine uterine pathogens, namely, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Killing of S. zooepidemicus was very efficient, as evidenced by a 94% decrease in numbers of CFU per milliliter after exposure to 100 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml (approximately 15 microM) for 2 h. Exposure of E. coli and P. aeruginosa to 200 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml for 2 h resulted in 90.2 and 77.6% reduction, respectively, in the numbers of CFU per milliliter. Bacteriostasis, without bactericidal activity, occurred after K. pneumoniae was incubated with 200 micrograms of eNAP-2 per ml. Additional studies will be required in other species and cell types to determine whether eNAP-2 is restricted to equine neutrophils or is the index member of a larger family of endogenous antibiotics.
TI  - [Clinical study on cefprozil in pediatrics].
AB  - Clinical efficacy and safety of cefprozil (CFPZ, BMY-28100), a newly developed oral cephalosporin, were studied in our pediatric department. Clinical effectiveness, bacteriological effectiveness and side effects were studied in 116 pediatric patients with ages ranging 4 months to 11 years. CFPZ was given 4.6-14.1 mg/kg daily in 3 times for 3-10 days. Clinical efficacies were evaluated in 112 patients, and the therapeutic effectiveness were excellent in 1 and good in 6 for 7 patients with acute pharyngitis, excellent in 24 and good in 26 for acute purulent tonsillitis, excellent in 3, good in 8 and fair in 1 for acute bronchitis, excellent in 21, good in 7, fair in 1 and poor in 1 for acute pneumonia, excellent in 1 acute purulent parotitis, excellent in 2 and good in 7 for acute UTI, good in 1 impetigo, fair in 1 periproctal abscess and good in 1 acute enteritis. The effectiveness rate was 96.4%. Bacteriologically, 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase producing strains), 1 strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (beta-lactamase producing strain), 2 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 strains of beta-Streptococcus, 1 strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (beta-lactamase producing strain) and 1 strain of Salmonella C2 were all disappeared, and of 22 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 20 strains were disappeared, 1 was decreased and 1 was unknown, of 5 strains of Escherichia coli (3 beta-lactamase producing strains), 4 were disappeared and 1 was decreased, of 29 strains of Haemophilus influenzae (14 beta-lactamase producing strains), 14 were disappeared, 11 were decreased, 3 persisted and 1 was unknown and of 2 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae (1 beta-lactamase producing strain), 1 was disappeared and 1 persisted. The bacteriological eradication rates for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 97.1% and 56.8%, respectively, and the drug was especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria. No side effects nor refusal of ingestion were observed. As abnormalities in laboratory test results, 3 cases of elevation of eosinophil counts and 1 of elevation of platelet counts were observed. In conclusion, CFPZ was considered to be a safe and highly effective antibiotic in pediatric infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefetamet against clinically isolated microbial strains collected from urban RTI patients].
AB  - The authors studied antimicrobial activities of cefetamet (CFMT) and other leading oral antimicrobials of beta-lactam class against clinically isolated strains from urban respiratory tract infection (RTI) patients from January to March, 1992. 1. CFMT showed potent antimicrobial activities against "3 primary pathogens" of RTIs i.e., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, but the drug had a slightly higher MIC than those of a few oxime-type cephems already on the market. 2. CFMT was as stable as cefixime to beta-lactamase, generated by Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, which reduces the antimicrobial activity of cephems. 3. Blood concentrations of CFMT after administering cefetamet pivoxil (CFMT-PI), an oral form of the drug, exceeded the MIC80 against the "3 primary pathogens" as well as M. (B) catarrhalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, for a duration of approximately 9 and 11 hours, respectively, after single doses of 250 and 500 mg. This suggests that CFMT could remain above the MICs for a sufficient time period with twice daily dosages of normal dose levels. 4. It is concluded that CFMT-PI will be useful for treating urban RTIs.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (CAZ) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout Japan in 1989 and 1991. Those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. The results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, MIC90 of CAZ in 1991 were markedly higher against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Also, among other bacteria such as Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to CAZ were observed in high proportions. However, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of CAZ on Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella spp, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Haemophilus influenzae and Anaerobic GPC (Gram-positive cocci). 2. Among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli of Enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. It appears therefore, that CAZ failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. Antimicrobial activities of CAZ on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. However, it was also demonstrated that CAZ maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. When it is additionally taken into account that CAZ is one of those limited drugs with activity against P. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that CAZ still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.
TI  - Evaluation of progesterone treatment to create a model for equine endometritis.
AB  - To investigate a model for equine endometritis, 12 mares with normal reproductive tracts were divided into 2 groups. All mares received progesterone in oil, 250 mg im, daily. At 5 days after initiation of progesterone administration, the uteri were inoculated with 10(6) colony forming units of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The day of inoculation was designated Day 0. On Day 6, endometrial swab samples yielded P. aeruginosa in 5 mares; samples from the other 7 mares yielded heavy growth of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter diversus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus morbillorum. On Days 6, 7 and 8, Group A mares received intrauterine infusions of 6 g ticarcillin disodium and 0.2 g clavulanate potassium in 100 ml sterile saline. Group B mares received infusions of saline only. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was significantly higher in Group A than Group B mares on Days 8 and 13 (4/6 vs 0/6). Swab samples from 5 of the 6 mares in Group A yielded growth of fungi on Days 13 and 19. Mares in Group B were then similarly treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate infusions, on Days 19, 20 and 21. The incidence of swab specimens yielding no bacterial growth was 2/6 and 1/6 on Days 21 and 26, respectively; fungi were not recovered from these mares at any time. The incidence of no-growth swabs after antibiotic treatment tended to be higher in Group A and incidence of fungal recovery after antibiotic treatment was significantly higher in Group A.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of paper money].
AB  - Bacteriological survey of one hundred twenty currency notes was done. Aerobic spore-forming bacilli (91%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (63.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.2%), Enterococcus (24.1%), alpha-hem. streptococcus (4.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1.7%), Corynebacterium (7.5%), Lactobacilli (10.8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31.7%), Enterobacter (19.2%), E. coli (17.5%), Proteus (1.7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%), Shigella flexneri (0.8%) were isolated from paper money samples. Currency notes in general were bacteriologically contaminated especially with enteric pathogens and potentially pathogens, it was thought that some measures have to be taken to reduce these ill effects.
TI  - DNA amplification fingerprinting of bacteria.
AB  - We have amplified short arbitrary stretches of total bacterial DNA to produce highly characteristic and complex DNA fingerprints. This DNA amplification fingerprinting (DAF) strategy involves enzymatic amplification of DNA directed by a single arbitrary oligonucleotide primer. Amplification produces a characteristic spectrum of products that is adequately resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. Although DAF is simple in concept, we found that amplification parameters must be within an optimal range for reproducibility. We establish a safe window for these parameters, which include magnesium, primer and enzyme concentration as well as cycle number. The refined procedure was used to distinguish between clinical isolates of Streptococcus uberis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. The use of template DNA concentrations higher than 1 ng.microliters-1 and high MgCl2 levels was especially important for reproducibility when amplifying small bacterial genomes. We tested a truncated Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase, the Stoffel fragment, and found it more tolerant of reaction conditions, more efficient in the amplification of short products, and able to produce more informative fingerprints when compared to the normal thermostable polymerase from which it was derived. Because DAF produces representative fingerprints quickly and reliably from bacteria regardless of prior genetic or biochemical knowledge, we anticipate the general use of this diagnostic tool for bacterial identification and taxonomy.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of OPC-17116, a new fluoroquinolone, against  a wide variety of clinical isolates was evaluated and compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. OPC-17116 showed potent broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The activity of this compound against gram-positive bacteria was higher than those of other quinolones, and its activity against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria was roughly comparable to those of other quinolones. OPC-17116 had potent activity against important pathogens of respiratory tract infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. The MICs of this compound against 90% of these organisms, except for methicillin-resistant S. aureus, ranged from less than or equal to 0.006 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. OPC-17116 at more than one-half the MICs was bactericidal against clinical isolates of S. aureus, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 was decreased by several culture conditions such as acidic pH, high concentration of Mg2+ ions, and inoculum size of 10(7) CFU/ml. OPC-17116 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrases from E. coli KL-16 and S. aureus SA113 (50% inhibitory concentrations, 0.19 and 23.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). The amount of OPC-17116 accumulation was higher than that of other quinolones in S. aureus.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of bronchial aspirates obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy].
AB  - We present the bacteriological findings in 329 aspirates from fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Quantitative cultures were not performed. 92 of the patients had radiologically confirmed pneumonia, 58 possibly had infectious bronchitis or pneumonia which was not verified radiologically, 154 had other pulmonary diseases and 25 had no verified pulmonary disease. 13% of aspirates contained no bacterial isolates and 33% revealed growth of multiple bacteria, classified as "normal pharyngeal flora". Among the 54% with specified bacterial findings the most frequent bacteria were viridans streptococci, staphylococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The differences in bacterial flora between the patient groups were only minimal. Klebsiella and Escherichia coli were the only bacteria indicating presence of pneumonia. S pneumoniae were found more frequently among patients with no signs of infection. Bronchial aspirates obtained with a fiberbronchoscope may give false positive results and are of limited value in diagnosing pneumonia. However, the presence of gram negative intestinal rods may indicate bacterial respiratory infection in hospitalized patients. Improving sampling and culture techniques can possibly improve the value of bacteriological findings.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E1077, a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a broad antibacterial spectrum.
AB  - E1077 is a new injectable cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The in vitro activities of E1077 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of E1077 for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.78 microgram/ml) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MIC90, 50 micrograms/ml) were similar to those of cefpirome and flomoxef. Against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml), E1077 was the most active of the drugs tested and four times more active than cefpirome. The MIC90S of E1077 for streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae ranged from 0.05 to 0.78 microgram/ml; E1077 was similar in activity to cefpirome. E1077 inhibited 90% of most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml, with the exception of Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris (12.5 micrograms/ml). The activity of E1077 against P. aeruginosa (MIC90, 6.25 micrograms/ml) was comparable to that of ceftazidime. In vivo activity was evaluated with systemic infections in mice. E1077 showed a protective effect against systemic infections by gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria, as reflected by its in vitro activity. The protective effects of E1077 were higher than those of cefpirome against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa infections and similar to those of cefpirome against other bacterial infections. Morphological studies using differential interference and phase-contrast microscopy showed that low concentrations of E1077 caused swelling of S. aureus and spheroplast and bulge formation in P. aeruginosa. In general, the antibacterial profile of E1077 is similar to that of cefpirome.
TI  - Plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone after oral doses of 400 and 800 mg.
AB  - The plasma bactericidal activity of a new C-5 methyl fluoroquinolone, OPC-17116,  was determined after once-daily oral ingestion of 400 mg and 800 mg in normal, healthy volunteers. OPC-17116 at a 400-mg dose produced plasma bactericidal titers greater than or equal to 1:16 at 12 hours against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. OPC-17116 bactericidal titers against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1:2 or 1:4 at 6 and 12 hours. The plasma bactericidal titers against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 1:4 or greater, but bactericidal titers against Staphylococcus aureus were 1:2 at 12 hours and less than 1:2 at 24 hours. The 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 produced bactericidal titers of at least 1:32 at 12 hours for the Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus, and Moraxella, and 1:4 for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, but bactericidal titers against S. aureus were 1:2. These data would suggest that an 800-mg dose of OPC-17116 taken orally once daily would provide adequate concentrations to treat infections due to the pathogens examined in this study.
TI  - Identification of eNAP-1, an antimicrobial peptide from equine neutrophils.
AB  - Endogenous, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides known as defensins are prominent components of human, rabbit, and rat neutrophils, yet little is known about their occurrence in other mammalian species. Although we did not detect mature (i.e., processed) defensins in equine neutrophil granules, we found that these granules contained small amounts of other cysteine-rich peptides with antimicrobial activity. One of these, eNAP-1, was purified by a combination of gel permeation and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography from acid extracts prepared from the cytoplasmic granules of equine neutrophils. The molecular mass of eNAP-1 was approximately 7.2 kDa, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Amino acid analysis revealed that eNAP-1 had an unusually high cysteine content and that it was relatively enriched in alanine, glycine, lysine, and proline residues. The partial (N-terminal) amino acid sequence of eNAP-1 was DVQCGEGHFCHDXQTCCRASQGGXACCPYSQGVCCADQRHCCPVGF. Thirty-six of these residues (78.3%) were identical to those of a recently cloned human neutrophil peptide of unknown function and belonging to the granulin family. Homologous peptides have also been noted in rat bone marrow cells and rat kidney epithelins. We tested the ability of eNAP-1 to kill several equine uterine pathogens. Streptococcus zooepidemicus was killed most effectively, sustaining a greater than 99.8% decrease in CFU per milliliter after a 2-h exposure to 100 micrograms of eNAP-1 per ml (approximately 15 microM). Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were somewhat less susceptible, manifesting 87.0 and 87.1% mean decreases in CFU per milliliter, respectively, after incubation for 2 h with 200 micrograms of eNAP-1 per ml. Klebsiella pneumoniae numbers were not significantly reduced after exposure to eNAP-1. These antimicrobial properties suggest that eNAP-1 may contribute to phagocyte-mediated host defense against equine infections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of major oral antibacterial agents against clinically isolated microbial strains from outpatients with respiratory tract infection].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for major oral antibacterial agents for clinically isolated microbial strains from materials collected from outpatients with respiratory tract infections in 1988, 1989 and 1990, and the following conclusions were obtained. 1. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) appeared to be responsible for community-acquired respiratory tract infections, but there also was a tendency showing that MRSA increased year by year. 2. A tendency was observed indicating that benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP) increased year by year. 3. Beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae were observed in a certain ratio, and also those of Branhamella catarrhalis were found in high ratios. 4. A tendency of increasing resistance of Klebsiella pneumoniae to new quinolones was observed. 5. It is of a great importance to evaluate methods of selecting primary choice antibiotic agents since increasing numbers of new oral antibacterial agents are becoming rapidly available.
TI  - In vitro activity of MC-352, a new 16-membered macrolide.
AB  - The in vitro activity of MC-352, 3,4'-dideoxy-5-O-mycaminosyltylonolide, was compared with those of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (MIC for 90% of isolates) for erythromycin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, similar to those of the other agents. The MC-352 MIC50 for erythromycin-resistant S. aureus was 2 micrograms/ml, similar to that of rokitamycin. The MC-352 MIC90 (0.12 micrograms/ml) for Streptococcus pyogenes was similar to those of erythromycin and clarithromycin and superior to that of rokitamycin, and the MC-352 MIC90 for group B, C, and G streptococci was 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 and clarithromycin had an MIC90 of 0.12 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Erythromycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis was inhibited by MC-352 at 1 microgram/ml, but the MIC for constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates was greater than 16 micrograms/ml. Legionella pneumophila was inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. MC-352 was the most active agent against Bacteroides fragilis, with an MIC90 of 8 micrograms/ml, and was more active than the other agents against Haemophilus influenzae, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. Moraxella spp. were inhibited by MC-352 at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia spp. was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MC-352 was bactericidal for S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae, and its activity was not altered by human serum.
TI  - Ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone. Results from a Multicenter, National Comparative Activity Surveillance Study. The Ofloxacin Surveillance Group.
AB  - Ofloxacin, a newer broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against 6967 clinical isolates in a multicenter surveillance trial using a standardized disk diffusion method. Thirty-five geographically diverse laboratories contributed zone diameter results for two (ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) to five (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, cefaclor, and cefixime) antimicrobial agents, depending on the site of infection. Ofloxacin was determined to have the widest spectrum of activity and potential empiric use (90.6%, range 87.1%-92.2%) for respiratory tract, urinary tract, and cutaneous infections. The spectrum was superior to ciprofloxacin (average 85.3% versus three sites), ampicillin (35.5%, respiratory tract), cefaclor (60.5%, respiratory tract), cefixime (60.9%, respiratory tract), and norfloxacin (87.3%, urinary tract). Strains resistant to ofloxacin (35 isolates, 0.5%) were confirmed by reference laboratory tests and cross resistance was observed among several current and investigational fluoroquinolone agents. The species most often found to be fluoroquinolone resistant among the Enterobacteriaceae were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Providencia spp. Monitoring for increasing fluoroquinolone resistance should be considered as greater use of drugs in this class develops. By these cited statistics, ofloxacin appears to have a broad and balanced spectrum of potential use, particularly against Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of ceftriaxone against clinically isolated strains].
AB  - Antibiotic activities (MICs) of ceftriaxone (CTRX) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of other cephems. 1. When compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated MIC90s of CTRX: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii and Providencia spp. No changes were observed in MIC90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Peptostreptococcus spp. 2. The MIC90 of CTRX to S. pneumoniae was high because a large number of benzylpenicillin (PCG)-insensitive S. pneumoniae (PISP) was present among this species. The MIC80 to Bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. Other oxime-type cephems also had high MICs against the above mentioned bacteria. Therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as CTRX against PISP and B. fragilis group. 3. Sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), cephamycin-resistant as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. Some of there resistant bacteria are also CTRX-resistant, and CTRX had insufficient activities against them. 4. With regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with CTRX-resistance from year to year, the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989 and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "Subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. It appears that those strains resistant to cephems including CTRX are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. CTRX, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. Furthermore, considering that CTRX is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that CTRX is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LJC 10,627.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LJC 10,627, a new carbapenem, was compared with those of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. LJC 10,627 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas cepacia, salmonellae, shigellae, aeromonas, and yersiniae at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Haemophilus influenzae was inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml, and moraxellae were inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml. LJC 10,627 was twofold more active than imipenem against aerobic gram-negative organisms and inhibited ceftazidime-, cefotaxime-, and gentamicin-resistant members of the genera Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Serratia at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Xanthomonas maltophilia strains were resistant to the drug. Imipenem was two- to fourfold more active than LJC 10,627 against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. LJC 10,627 did not inhibit most methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. LJC 10,627 inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.06 and 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. were inhibited by 0.5 microgram of LJC 10,627 per ml. Serum (50%) did not affect the MICs. LJC 10,627 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases of Bush types 2b, 2b', TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, TEM-7, TEM-9, and SHV-1; the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Bush type 1; P-99; a Morganella enzyme; or a Citrobacter freundii enzyme. The Bush type 2c and 2d enzymes OXA-1, OXA-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, and PSE-4 did not hydrolyze LJC 10,627, nor did the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Proteus vulgaris. The beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas hydrolyzed LJC 10,627, albeit at approximately one-third the rate that imipenem was hydrolyzed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of RU29246, the active metabolite of HR916B.
AB  - HR 916B is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. In tests its active metabolite, RU29246, inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. It was also more active (MIC 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. RU29246 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia stuartii and Salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor, but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens or Bacteroides fragilis. RU29246 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, Staphylococcus aureus TEM-2 or Moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Proteus vulgaris and Morganella morganii. Plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by RU29246.
TI  - In vitro activity of loracarbef and effects of susceptibility test methods.
AB  - Loracarbef is a new oral antimicrobial of the carbacephem class with in vitro activity against the common pathogens associated with skin infections, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchopulmonary infections, and urinary tract infections. A review of the literature shows the following ranges for 90% minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90) values (microgram/mL) against the organisms that commonly cause these illnesses: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.25-2.0; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-8.0; M. catarrhalis (beta-lactamase negative), 0.12-0.25; Haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive), 0.5-16.0; H. influenzae (beta-lactamase negative), 0.25-8.0; Escherichia coli, 2.0-25; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.25-8.0; Proteus mirabilis, 1.0-8.0; Streptococcus pyogenes, less than or equal to 0.06-1.0; Staphylococcus aureus (beta-lactamase positive), 8.0; S. aureus (beta-lactamase negative), 1.0-2.0. The in vitro activity of loracarbef against these common outpatient pathogens is similar to that of other oral antimicrobials such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The results of in vitro susceptibility tests with any antimicrobial, including loracarbef, are somewhat dependent on the specific test method that is employed in the laboratory. This is particularly true with H. influenzae. Furthermore, the results of loracarbef susceptibility tests are of uncertain value in predicting therapeutic outcome.
TI  - The predominant microflora of the palatal mucosa in an elderly island population.
AB  - The prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary health-monitoring project (Koster Health Project) on the Koster islands, Sweden. Upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. Denture stomatitis type I was identified as sialadenitis. The more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types II and III) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. Only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. Hemophilus spp. and Bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types II and III. Shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. It is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies with meropenem in the pediatric field. Pediatric Study Group of Meropenem].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic and clinical evaluations in pediatrics were made on meropenem (SM-7338, MEPM), a new parenteral dehydropeptidase-1 stable carbapenem used without any inhibitors, at 33 medical institutions. The results are summarized as follows. 1. Pharmacokinetic studies. MEPM at a dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg was administered to 53 children by 30-minute drip infusion. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax's) and plasma half-lives (T1/2's) of these doses were 28.5, 47.2 and 130.0 micrograms/ml, and 0.80, 0.93 and 0.94 hours, respectively. A clear dose response was observed in Cmax's and T1/2 values were quite similar to those observed in adults. In the first 6 hours after administration, 54.4 to 68.1% of the administered drug was recovered in urine. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of MEPM in patients with purulent meningitis were 0.13 microgram/ml at a dose of 6 mg/kg, and 0.64 to 4.22 micrograms/ml at a dose of 29 to 44 mg/kg within day 4 of onset. The penetration rate of MEPM showed an intermediate value among those for other cephalosporin antibiotics. 2. Clinical study. Clinical efficacies of MEPM were evaluated in 389 cases. The most common doses used were 10 to 20 mg/kg/once, 2 to 3 times a day. The maximum dose was 173 mg/kg/day q.i.d. MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 242 (97.6%) out of 248 cases in which causative organisms were documented and in 134 (95.0%) out of 141 cases in which causative organisms were not identified. Clinical efficacy rates were 100% in 11 patients with purulent meningitis, 85.7% in 7 with septicemia, 98.8% in 173 with pneumonia, and 100% in 65 with UTI. Bacteriologically, 260 strains (96.7%) out of 269 strains were eradicated by MEPM treatment. Eradication rates were 89.2% for Staphylococcus aureus (37 strains) and 100% for Streptococcus pneumoniae (35 strains). The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive bacteria was 94.6%. Among Gram-negative bacteria, 98.3% out of 172 strains were eradicated. The eradication rate of Haemophilus influenzae (73 strains) was 98.6% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11 strains) was 90.9%, and all of Branhamella catarrhalis (15 strains), Escherichia coli (42 strains), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 strains) were eradicated. Out of 84 cases for which previous antibiotic therapies of 3 days or longer were not successful, MEPM gave "excellent" or "good" responses in 77 cases (91.7%) and excellent bacteriological responses (95.7%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin prodrug-ester HR 916. III. Pharmacokinetic properties and antibacterial activity in vivo.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of the broad spectrum cephem RU 29 246 and its prodrug-ester HR 916 B were investigated in mice, rats and dogs and compared to those of cefpodoxime proxetil, cefuroxime axetil and cefixime. HR 916 B is well absorbed following oral administration and efficiently converted to the antibacterially active form. In mice, mean peak blood levels of 31.1 micrograms/ml of the parent compound were recorded within 20 minutes after oral administration of a single dose equivalent to 40 mg/kg RU 29 246. The bioavailability calculated on the basis of the areas under the concentration-time curves (AUC) and the urinary recoveries was about 90%. In rats, peak blood levels of 14.5 micrograms/ml were obtained 1 hour after an oral 20 mg/kg dose. The bioavailability was calculated as 70%. In dogs, 40% of an oral 10 mg/kg dose was recovered in the urine within 24 hours. Cmax was 15.9 micrograms/ml at 4.6 hours. Mean elimination half-lives of RU 29 246 were 0.35, 0.5 and 2.1 hours in mice, rats and dogs, respectively. After an oral HR 916 B dose equivalent to 50 mg/kg of RU 29 246, tissue concentrations at 0.5 hour ranged between 0.8 micrograms/g in brain and 95.7 micrograms/g in murine kidneys. These values of HR 916 B are similar to, or distinctly higher than, those of the reference compounds. Of the oral cephalosporins tested, HR 916 B had the most balanced antibacterial spectrum. With ED50s of between 0.9 and 11.5 mg/kg against staphylococci, its activity was similar to that of the additional reference compound cefaclor and higher than that of cefuroxime. Cefixime and cefpodoxime proxetil displayed low antistaphylococcal activity or were inactive. In septicemias with Enterobacteriaceae, cefixime and cefpodoxime proxetil were more potent than HR 916 B and cefaclor. Cefuroxime axetil was inactive against most of these infections. HR 916 B was also highly effective against murine lung infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae DT-S or Streptococcus pneumoniae 1147.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolones: rufloxacin and MF 961.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of two new quinolone antimicrobials, rufloxacin and MF 961, together with the desmethylated metabolite of rufloxacin (MF 922) were compared with other orally administered agents against 622 bacterial strains. Against Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa rufloxacin was generally active (MIC90 1-8 mg/L) with the exception of Klebsiella and Serratia spp. (MIC90 32 mg/L and Enterobacter spp. (MIC90) 64 mg/L. The respiratory pathogens Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/L respectively) but Streptococcus pneumoniae was less susceptible (MIC90 32 mg/L). Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to rufloxacin (MIC90 2 mg/L). The rufloxacin metabolite MF 922 was generally as active as its parent. MF 961 was usually two-fold more active than rufloxacin. All three compounds were four to 16 times less active than norfloxacin, but rufloxacin was as active or somewhat more active than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus spp. Any strains showing decreased susceptibility to other quinolones exhibited cross resistance to these new agents. The MBC of rufloxacin and MF 922 was within one dilution of the MIC and human serum had little effect upon the activity of both agents. The protein binding of rufloxacin and MF 922 at 1 and 10 mg/L were 55% and 63.8% and 30.3% and 32.6% respectively. The activity of rufloxacin against four strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and one strain of Chlamydia pneumoniae was determined. The MICs for C. trachomatis were 4-8 mg/L and 4 mg/L for C. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Acute suppurative thyroiditis and Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. A case report and review of the literature].
AB  - The acute suppurative thyroiditis is a rare infection. It affects specially patients with preexisting thyroid gland pathology and its frequency is higher in women. In childhood it's linked to local anatomic defects. The infection used to be located in left thyroid lobe and it's much less usual in right lobe, in both or in isthmus. The most important causal microorganisms are staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus overcoat) and streptococci (usually Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae), with frequent isolation of mixed flora and anaerobes in the last reported cases. We present the case of a male patient, without previous thyroid disease, who suffered an acute suppurative thyroiditis and Sepsis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae, with right lobe abscess and secondary septic focus formation (kidneys, spleen, lungs), with fatal course despite of medical treatment, favoured or precipitated by the development of serious alcoholic abstinence.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefquinome, a new cephalosporin, compared with other cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefquinome, a new aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a C-3 bicyclic pyridinium group, was compared with ceftazidime, cefpirome, and cefepime. Cefquinome inhibited members of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Citrobacter diversus, Salmonella Shigella, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella, and Providencia. Although most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae were inhibited by less than 2 micrograms/ml, some strains resistant to ceftazidime were resistant, [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) greater than 16 micrograms/ml]. Serratia marcescens were inhibited by less than 1 microgram/ml and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by 8 micrograms/ml similar to the activity of cefepime. The majority of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited by less than 0.25 microgram/ml. Most enterococci had cefquinome MICs of 4-8 micrograms/ml. Cefquinome was extremely active against group-A streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MICs less than 0.12 microgram/ml. 90% of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus 90% were inhibited by 2 micrograms/ml. Overall, the in vitro activity of cefquinome was comparable with aminothiazolyl cephalosporins. It inhibited some Enterobacter and Citrobacter freundii resistant to ceftazidime as did cefpirome and cefepime. Cefquinome was not destroyed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Klebsiella, Branhamella, and Pseudomonas, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-5, and TEM-9. Its activity was not adversely decreased in different medium or protein, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for most species except for Enterobacter were within a dilution of MICs.
TI  - [Peripheral blood cells secreting specific antibodies after oral stimulation with a ribosomal vaccine].
AB  - This investigation was designed to investigate mechanisms underlying oral immunization in humans after ingestion of the ribosomal vaccine D53. Immunofluorescence and ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) spot techniques were used for peripheral blood studies. The first part of the investigation was a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 12 healthy volunteers; counts of cells containing immunoglobulins and cells producing specific antibodies were higher in the individuals given the oral ribosomal vaccine than in the placebo-treated controls. In the second part of the investigation, analysis of the kinetics of apparition of the immunoglobulin-containing and specific antibody-producing cells suggested prompt stimulation of Peyer patch B lymphocytes following ingestion of the vaccine. Lastly, a study of 5 children given the vaccine on a long-term basis demonstrated increased counts of both above-described cell types after one month treatment.
TI  - Microflora of the pouch of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus).
AB  - Microflora of the pouch epithelium of 17 female koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) were examined in relation to their current reproductive status and recent reproductive history. No microbial growth was observed in pouch swabs from 13 of 17 (76%) koalas, including four females without young, seven with pouch young and two with back young (i.e. permanently emerged from the pouch). Growth of bacteria or yeasts was observed in pouch swabs from four koalas, each of which had experienced mortality of its pouch young during the current breeding season. Seven species of microorganisms were isolated, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Enterococcus faecalis. Based on the absence of microflora in the majority of females examined, we propose that the pouch epithelium normally provides a hostile environment for microbial colonization.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of levofloxacin (l-ofloxacin), an optically active ofloxacin.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of levofloxacin was compared with those of ofloxacin,  ciprofloxacin, and other antibiotics. In general, levofloxacin was equally active or up to fourfold more active than ofloxacin against all 801 organisms tested. Levofloxacin was twofold [corrected] more active than ciprofloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and 2- to 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Xanthomonas maltophilia, and Bacteroides fragilis. Levofloxacin was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci and Acinetobacter spp., although these improvements in potency may not be clinically relevant. Levofloxacin inhibited 90% of streptococci when it was used at concentrations of 1 to 2 micrograms/ml. Levofloxacin was two- to fourfold less active than ciprofloxacin against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter, Proteus, Providencia, Salmonella, and Yersinia spp.; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both compounds were equally active against Pseudomonas cepacia. The in vitro DNA gyrase inhibitory activity of levofloxacin was as potent as that of ciprofloxacin, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.65 micrograms/ml against an E. coli enzyme. In vivo, oral treatment with levofloxacin was as efficacious or more efficacious than that with ciprofloxacin in systemic as well as pyelonephritis infections in mice. Levofloxacin achieved higher concentrations in the serum and tissue of mice than did ciprofloxacin. This study presents some potential advantages of the pure L isomer of ofloxacin over ciprofloxacin and other quinolones.
TI  - Loracarbef (LY163892) versus amoxicillin/clavulanate in the treatment of acute purulent bacterial bronchitis.
AB  - In this single-blind study, 488 patients with acute bronchitis were randomly assigned to receive 400 mg of loracarbef twice daily or 500/125 mg of amoxicillin/clavulanate three times daily for seven days. Treatment efficacy was evaluated in 98 patients treated with loracarbef and in 99 treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate in whom pretreatment positive cultures of pathogens susceptible to both study drugs were found. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in pure or mixed cultures in 64% of the evaluable patients; S pneumoniae was found in 26%. Among the evaluable patients, the rate of favorable clinical responses (cure and improvement) in the loracarbef group (96 of 98 patients; 98.0%) was similar to that in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group (96 of 99 patients; 97.0%); the favorable bacteriologic response rates were also similar (93.7% vs 92.9%, respectively). Eight patients in the loracarbef group and nine in the amoxicillin/clavulanate group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The events were presumed to be drug related in five of the loracarbef group and in seven of the amoxicillin/clavulanate group. During therapy, diarrhea was the most frequently reported event in both groups. However, it occurred in only 8.2% of the loracarbef-treated patients compared with 22.5% of the amoxicillin/clavulanate patients (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that both loracarbef and amoxicillin/clavulanate are safe and effective in the treatment of acute purulent bacterial bronchitis.
TI  - Bacterial quantification--a necessary complement for the comprehension of middle  ear inflammations.
AB  - Quantification of bacteria in various types of middle ear effusion (MEE) obtained during current acute otitis media (AOM), otitis media with effusion (OME) and chronic suppurative otitis media (COM) was performed. The bacteria were stained with acridine orange and their number per ml effusion evaluated under the fluorescence microscope according to a method described in detail elsewhere. During AOM, 53% of the MEE samples were culture-positive and contained 10(6)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 10(7) per ml). During OME, serous effusion and 78% of the mucoid effusions contained no bacteria whatsoever, whereas the remaining mucoid effusions contained 10(4)-5 x 10(5) bacteria per ml (median value 10(4) per ml). Mucopurulent effusions contained 6 x 10(5)-10(8) bacteria per ml (median value 5 x 10(6) per ml). During COM, purulent MEE had 6 x 10(6)-10(9) bacteria per ml (median value 10(8) per ml). Quantification of bacteria involved in middle ear diseases provides further information about the etiopathogenesis and appropriate management of various pathological conditions of the middle ear.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new quinolone, OPC-17116.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of OPC-17116 were compared with those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and tosufloxacin. The MICs of OPC-17116 for 90% of the strains tested were 0.125 to 8 micrograms/ml against gram-positive bacteria such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus: less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae; and less than or equal to 0.063 to 16 micrograms/ml against glucose-nonfermentative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of OPC-17116 against gram-positive organisms was comparable to that of tosufloxacin and higher than those of other reference drugs. The in vitro activity of OPC-17116 against gram-negative bacteria was similar to those of the reference drugs. In experimental systemic infections in mice with various organisms, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was similar to that of tosufloxacin and greater than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and ciprofloxacin. In a pyelonephritic model in mice with P. aeruginosa KU-1, OPC-17116 was as active as ciprofloxacin and more active than ofloxacin, enoxacin, and tosufloxacin. In respiratory tract infections in mice with Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Streptococcus pneumoniae TMS 3, and Klebsiella pneumoniae 3K25, the efficacy of OPC-17116 was generally greater than that of tosufloxacin. The peak level of OPC-17116 in the lungs of mice was 10 times higher than that in serum and was significantly greater than levels in lung achieved with an equivalent dose of the other quinolones. The therapeutic efficacy of OPC-17116 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its high concentration in tissue.
TI  - [A clinical study on panipenem/betamipron in chronic respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (CS-976, PAPM/BP), a new carbapenem antibiotic, was administered a single dose of 500 mg or 750 mg via intravenous drip infusion twice a day for treatment of chronic respiratory infection to study its clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety. Twenty nine cases were studied for the efficacy evaluation. Only the safety evaluation was made in 6 cases which were judged to be unsuitable, because in some of them pneumonia and other diseases were not specified as the subject diseases, of serious illness in some the conditions were too serious, and in the other cases the duration of administration was insufficient since administration had to be discontinued due to side-effects. The duration of administration was 6 to 18 days with 1 g divided into 2 doses daily or 4 to 15 days with 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily. When clinical efficacies were classified according to different diseases, this preparation was effective in 11 cases and slightly effective in 1 case of 12 cases of chronic bronchitis with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. It was effective in 10 cases, slightly effective in 1 case and ineffective in 1 case of 12 cases of bronchiectasis with an efficacy rate of 83.3%. It was slightly effective in 2 and ineffective in 1 out of 3 cases of diffuse panbronchiolitis, and was effective in 2 cases of pulmonary emphysema with infections. PAPM/BP was given at a dose level of 1 g in 2 divided doses daily to 17 cases and that of 1.5 g in 2 divided doses daily to 10 cases. For the remaining 2 cases, changes in the dose level were made in middle course of treatment. The efficacy rate in the 1 g regimen was 76.5% and that with the 1.5 g regimen was 90%. The overall results in the 29 cases included 23 effective, 4 slightly effective and 2 ineffective cases, thus the overall efficacy rate was 79.3%. As pathogens, 11 species including 24 strains were isolated and identified from 19 cases. They were Gram-positive cocci including 2 strains each of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 strain each of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus viridans and a strain of Streptococcus spp., and Gram-negative rods including 9 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain each of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas spp.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [A study on in vitro antibacterial activity and clinical usefulness in respiratory tract infections of panipenem/betamipron, a newly synthesized carbapenem antibiotic].
AB  - Panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) is a combination drug of PAPM, a new parenteral carbapenem antibiotic and BP, an amino acid derivative at a weight ratio of 1:1. Its in vitro antibacterial activities against clinically isolated respiratory pathogenic bacteria were determined. It was superior to imipenem (IPM) in the in vitro antibacterial activities against Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus including MRSA, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli. PAPM had antibacterial activities almost equal to those of IPM against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, its antibacterial activity was about 1/4 that of IPM. The clinical usefulness of PAPM/BP was studied by dissolving it in a solution containing lactate and administering the solution by intravenous drip infusion to 12 cases of respiratory tract infections. Out of 11 cases with respiratory tract infections excluding cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the efficacy rate was 90.9%, with 4 cases of excellent and 6 cases of good responses. In terms of its bacteriological efficacies, eradication of pathogenic bacteria including super-infection were observed in 2 out of 4 strains, but 2 strains of P. aeruginosa remained unchanged. Six strains appeared as superinfected bacteria during and after administration of this preparation substituting original pathogens. Side-effects were not observed in the 12 cases, and in laboratory tests, slight transient increases of S-GOT and S-GPT were found in 1 case. In conclusion, PAPM/BP is a very useful parenteral antibiotic against respiratory tract infections and can be one of the drugs of the first choice.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of ofloxacin, L-ofloxacin, and other oral  agents for respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The attainable inhibitory ratios (AR) for oral antibiotics were calculated by using literature reports of concentrations attained in respiratory secretions for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMX/CA), ofloxacin (OFL), L-ofloxacin (L-OFL), cefuroxime (CEFU), ciprofloxacin (CIP), and enoxacin (ENO), and using microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration data of these antimicrobials against the common bacterial respiratory pathogens. AR of each antibiotic against the pathogens was expressed as multiples of the MICs achieved at the respiratory site. Bacteria tested included Staphylococcus aureus, group-A and group-B streptococci, Viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Brahamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eikenella corrodens, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Legionella pneumophila. The antimicrobials with the narrowest spectrum of activity were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and cefuroxime which had high attainable inhibitory ratios only against Gram-positive cocci. Ofloxacin and L-oflaxacin were among the quinolones with the highest overall ARs against respiratory pathogen, including, L. pneumophila, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. All agents showed no, or inadequately low ARs for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Controlled comparison of the BacT/Alert and BACTEC 660/730 nonradiometric blood culture systems.
AB  - In a collaborative study at three university hospitals, the recovery of microorganisms and the speed of detection of microbial growth by the BacT/Alert (Organon Teknika Corporation, Durham, N.C.) and BACTEC 660/730 (Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Instrument Systems, Sparks, Md.) nonradiometric blood culture systems were compared. A total of 5,918 comparisons were made between BacT/Alert aerobic and BACTEC NR 6A bottles and 5,992 comparisons were made between BacT/Alert anaerobic and BACTEC NR 7A bottles. Each bottle was inoculated with 5 ml of blood. The overall recoveries of microorganisms from the two aerobic bottles were comparable; members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were recovered more often from BacT/Alert aerobic bottles alone (P less than 0.001). The overall recoveries of microorganisms from the anaerobic bottles were not significantly different. Growth of Staphylococcus aureus (P less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than 0.01), streptococci (P less than 0.001), Escherichia coli (P less than 0.01), other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.02), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than 0.05) was detected earlier in BacT/Alert aerobic bottles. Growth of S. aureus (P less than 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P less than 0.05), enterococci (P less than 0.01), Streptococcus pneumoniae (P less than 0.02), viridans group streptococci (P less than 0.05), E. coli (P less than 0.001), Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than 0.01), and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P less than 0.001) was detected earlier in BacT/Alert anaerobic bottles. In a system-versus-system comparison, more gram-positive cocci were recovered from the BACTEC system alone (P < 0.05), and more members or the family Enterobacteriaceae were recovered from the BacT/Alert system alone (P < 0.001). As a system, the BacT/Alert system detected growth of S. aureus (P < 0.001), coagulase-negative staphylococci (P < 0.01), streptococci (P < 0.001), E. coli (P < 0.001), other members of the familyEnterobacteriaceae (P < 0.001), and P. aeruginosa (P < 0.05) earlier than the BACTEC system did. Significantly fewer (40 versus 1,183) false-positive results occurred with the BacT/Alert system. We conclude that the BacT/Alert and BACTEC 660/730 nonradiometric systems are comparable for recovering clinically significant microorganisms form adult patients with bacteremia or fungemia, but that the BacT/Alert system detects microbial growth earlier than the BACTEC system does, with significantly fewer false-positive results.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the investigational oral and parenteral cephalosporin BK-218.
AB  - BK-218 is a novel cephalosporin with a dual route of administration and spectrum  of activity most similar to that of second-generation cephalosporins. BK-218 was active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis but strains resistant to penicillins had higher MICs. BK-218 had greater activity (8-fold) than cefuroxime or cefaclor against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp. Moderate BK-218 activity was observed against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli (MIC90, 1 mg/l), Klebsiella spp. (MIC90, 2 mg/l), and Proteus mirabilis (MIC90, 2 mg/l). The following organisms were generally BK-218-resistant (MIC90, greater than 16 mg/l): Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Xanthomonas maltophilia, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., indole-positive Proteus, Serratia spp., enterococci and oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Bacteraemia in children in the south-western Cape. A hospital-based survey.
AB  - During 1989, of the 8,524 children admitted to the paediatric wards of Tygerberg  Hospital, 165 (1.96%) had bacteraemia. The incidence of community-acquired bacteraemias was 1.6% and that of nosocomial bacteraemias 0.5%. The most important community-acquired isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Neisseria meningitidis. The most important nosocomial isolates were Klebsiella and Salmonella spp. Both bacteraemia (relative risk (RR) = 2.08) and severe malnutrition (RR = 3.01) were more common in black patients. Overall, severe malnutrition was more common than mild malnutrition or a normal nutritional status in bacteraemic patients (odds radio (OR) = 3.17). Nineteen patients with bacteraemia died, there was a significantly higher case-fatality rate in patients with extreme malnutrition (P = 0.03; OR = 3.7). Gram-negative bacilli were found more commonly in patients with extreme malnutrition (OR = 5.4) and patients with nosocomial bacteraemia (OR = 4.6). Three of 39 patients (7.6%) with nosocomial bacteraemia had suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Cefetamet pivoxil: a review of its microbiology, toxicology, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy.
AB  - Cefetamet pivoxil is an oral, third-generation cephalosporin whose broad spectrum of antibacterial activity and favorable pharmacokinetic profile make it particularly suitable for the treatment of a wide range of infectious diseases. Cefetamet has high in vitro activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that cause a number of respiratory tract and urinary tract infections. These include penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Proteus spp., Klebsiella spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is not active against staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas spp. or Bacteroides fragilis but does inhibit most bile-sensitive (oral) Bacteroides spp. Animal toxicology studies indicate that neither cefetamet pivoxil nor the active compound cefetamet have significant teratogenic, mutagenic, photogenic or allergenic potential. Cefetamet is eliminated unchanged in the urine with a half-life of 2.2 h. Volume of distribution approximates the extracellular fluid space (0.3 1/kg), protein binding is minima (22%) and oral bioavailability of cefetamet pivoxil is approximately 50% when taken with food. No significant drug interactions have been noted to date. The efficacy and tolerability of cefetamet pivoxil have been evaluated in the treatment of gram-positive and gram-negative infections in almost 5,000 patients. In comparative studies, cefetamet pivoxil was at least as effective, and in many cases clinically superior, to most currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of urinary tract infections including gonorrhea and complicated infections in high risk patients. Efficacy has also been demonstrated in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia and infections of the ear, nose and throat. Clinical trials have shown that a 7 day treatment period with cefetamet pivoxil is as effective as a 10 day course of phenoxymethylpenicillin in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis. Cefetamet pivoxil has been well-tolerated in clinical trials with only 1.2% of patients on standard doses discontinuing therapy prematurely. The most common adverse effects are gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting) which occur in less than 10% of patients. Many current antibiotic treatment regimens involve the administration of three or more daily doses. However, standard doses of cefetamet pivoxil 500 mg twice daily provide unbound plasma concentrations of cefetamet which generally exceed the MIC(90) for susceptible organisms throughout the dosing interval and have been demonstrated to be clinically effective. This should result in good compliance with therapy in out-patients. Dosing regimens for cefetamet pivoxil should be adjusted in patients with impaired renal function while standard doses can be given to elderly patients and those with liver disease. Standard doses in children are 10 mg/kg or alternatively, children may receive a dose reduced in proportion to the ratio of their body surface area to that of an adult.
TI  - Oral ofloxacin therapy for lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - We made an open, noncomparative evaluation of ofloxacin, 400 mg orally bid for 10 days, in 98 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia or pathogen-confirmed bronchitis. Thirty-nine (40%) of the subjects were treated in the hospital and 59 (60%) were treated as outpatients. The mean age of those treated was 56.2 years; 73 (74%) of the subjects either were more than 60 years old or had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or both. There were 95 organisms initially isolated in sputum, aspirate, or lavage fluid; all were susceptible to ofloxacin, and none acquired resistance during therapy. Haemophilus influenzae was the most common pathogen (19 isolates), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (18) and Staphylococcus aureus (10). Clinical responses included cure in 70 patients (71%), improvement in 26 (27%), and failure in two (2%). After 10 days of therapy, pathogens persisted in two cases; in one case, Streptococcus salivarius was isolated, though it remained susceptible to ofloxacin, and in the other, Klebsiella pneumoniae was accompanied by superinfection due to a resistant strain of Serratia marcescens. We included in this study three confirmed cases of atypical pneumonia successfully treated with ofloxacin, two of them due to Mycoplasma pneumonia and one to Legionella pneumophila. Ofloxacin was well tolerated. Our data indicate that ofloxacin is effective and safe as specific and empiric treatment for many lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Effects of growth factors, hormones, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and lipotechoic acids on the clonal growth of normal ureteral epithelial cells in serum-free culture.
AB  - In vitro tissue culture techniques were employed to study the effects of bacterial endotoxins on the growth of normal epithelial cells from the human ureter (NHU). Primary cultures of NHU cells were initiated from explant outgrowth cultures of human ureteral tissue and cultured on collagen gel in F-12* medium containing 1% fetal calf serum (FCS). Optimal clonal growth of secondary cultures of NHU cells seeded at relatively low seeding cell densities, directly on plastic dishes, was achieved in F-12* medium containing bovine pituitary extract (0.5% BPE) and 0.05% BSA. Results indicated that insulin in the F-12* medium could be replaced by three orders of magnitude less IGF-1. Further clonal growth experiments demonstrated that PGE1 is growth stimulatory and can replace BPE as a growth factor requirement. This finding was in agreement with the fact that BPE growth requirement could be replaced by cholera toxin or dibutyryl cAMP. These results suggested that both BPE and cholera toxin operated by activation of a cAMP-dependent mitogenic pathway. Seven gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and three gram-positive bacterial lipotechoic acids (LT) were tested for their effects on NHU clonal growth. Three out of the five LPS derived from Escherichia coli (strains 055:B5, 0128:B12, and 0127:B8), LPS from Klebsiella pneumoniae, and LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa all showed significant growth inhibitory effects at minimally effective doses ranging from 5 to 25 micrograms/ml. LPS derived from E. coli strain (0111:B4) had no growth effects at the highest concentration tested (100 micrograms/ml). In contrast, LT derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, S. faecalis, Staphylococcus aureas, and Bacillus subtilis all markedly enhanced clonal growth at concentrations ranging from 1 microgram/ml less than [LT] less than 50 micrograms/ml. LT from Strep. pyogenes was inhibitory to clonal growth at 100 micrograms/ml. The growth inhibitory effects of LPS were shown to be sensitive to the presence of hydrocortisone in the growth medium, indicating that LPS effects on growth are mediated via the arachidonic acid cascade. We speculate that these results indicate a link between the susceptibility of uroepithelial tissue to the pathogenic microflora seen in urinary tract diseases and the differential sensitivity of proliferation-competent uroepithelial cells to growth inhibition by LPS produced by gram-negative bacteria. However, further studies with uropathogenic serotypes will be necessary to corroborate this possibility. The growth-stimulating activity of LTs produced by gram-positive bacteria may be due to their ability to bind to cell-associated fibronectin and to activate the fibronectin receptor as part of ligand receptor-induced mitogenic transmembrane signalling pathway.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of meropenem were compared with those of imipenem, ceftazidime, flomoxef, cefuzonam and cefotiam. Meropenem showed a broad antibacterial spectrum against clinical isolates of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Against Gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, meropenem exhibited the most potent activity among the drugs tested. It inhibited all 330 strains of Enterobacteriaceae at 0.78 mg/l. Meropenem was sensitive against several cephem-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, meropenem was four-fold more active than imipenem and eight-fold more active than ceftazidime, with an MIC90 of 0.78 mg/l. The therapeutic effect of meropenem on systemic infection in mice was ten to twenty-fold less than that of imipenem against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, meropenem was as effective as imipenem on infections of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Meropenem was eliminated from mice plasma two-fold faster than imipenem, with a plasma half-life of 7.6 min. From the above results the authors concluded that meropenem is a promising drug for clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefodizime.
AB  - Cefodizime is a bactericidal cephem with the typical broad spectrum activity of an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, including both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: its MIC90 is 0.125 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci; and 0.05 mg/l for Haemophilus spp., Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Moraxella catarrhalis; while beta-lactamase positive strains of M. catarrhalis require 1 mg/l. Less than 1 mg/l is needed for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp. and Shigella spp. The MIC90 is 4 mg/l for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp. and most strains of Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis and most strains of Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. are considered cefodizime-resistant. Cefodizime is unaffected by plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but it is hydrolyzed by some chromosomally mediated enzymes, thus resembling other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefodizime has high affinity for PBP 3 and PBP IA and IB (Escherichia coli); in S. aureus it shows the highest affinity for PBP 1.
TI  - Review of effectiveness of cefodizime in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections with parenchymal involvement.
AB  - The efficacy of cefodizime (CDZ) in lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) with parenchymal involvement was assessed by the analysis of data from 919 patients who participated in four controlled, randomized studies and three open studies. Sputum bacteriology and a chest x-ray were performed at baseline and after therapy. A total of 778 patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy and 451 for bacteriological efficacy. The most frequent pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. CDZ 1 g b.i.d., 2 g b.i.d. and 2 g once daily achieved clinical and bacteriological cure rates above 90%, which matched those observed with the comparators (cefuroxime 1.5 g t.i.d. and cefotaxime 2 g b.i.d.). No significant differences in clinical and bacteriological outcome were detected when the various CDZ dosage regimens were compared. 1 g CDZ b.i.d. is therefore recommended as the regimen of choice for the treatment of LRTI with parenchymal involvement, with CDZ 2 g once daily as an alternative.
TI  - Septicemia in granulocytopenic patients: a shift in bacterial etiology.
AB  - 35 episodes of septicemia in 33 patients occurred among 269 consecutive patients  with granulocytopenia (granulocyte cell count less than or equal to 0.5 x 10(9)/l) during the 7-year period 1982-1988. 59% of isolated bacteria were Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Streptococcus species and Pneumococcus) and 41% Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter and Citrobacter). Compared to the 7-year period 1975-1981, there was a decrease in the relative number of patients with Gram-negative septicemia. Thus, a shift from a predominating Gram-negative etiology in the 1975-1981 period to a predominating Gram-positive etiology in the 1982-1988 period was noted. In both periods the mortality rate was high in patients with Gram-negative septicemia, especially in patients with a Ps, aeruginosa infection.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of 5% and 10% granules of  cefdinir in the pediatric field].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefdinir (CFDN, FK482),  a new oral cephalosporin, 5% and 10% granules, were performed in the field of pediatrics. The results are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities Antibacterial activities of CFDN against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied in comparison with those of cefaclor (CCL), cefixime (CFIX) and amoxicillin (AMPC). MIC80's of CFDN against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, B. catarrhalis, K. pneumoniae and E. coli were 0.78, 0.20, less than or equal to 0.025, 0.39, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.10 micrograms/ml, respectively. These results show that CFDN has high antibacterial activities against these organisms. MIC80's of CFDN against Gram-positive bacteria were similar to those of AMPC, and was lower than those of CCL and CFIX. As for antibacterial activities against Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), the MIC80 of CFIX against H. influenzae was 0.05 micrograms/ml, which was slightly lower than that of CFDN. THe MIC80's of CFDN against other GNB were similar to those of CFIX. 2. Absorption and excretion Blood concentrations and urinary excretion rates of CFDN 5% and 10% granules and 100 mg capsule were determined. The data on CFDN 10% granules were similar to those on CFDN 5% granules. At a dose of 3 mg/kg, peak blood concentrations (Cmax's) of CFDN ranged from 0.20 to 2.12 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and from 0.50 to 1.15 micrograms/ml with 10% granules at 2 to 3 hours after dosing. At a dose of 6 mg/kg, peak concentrations were 0.66-2.06 micrograms/ml and 0.70-1.52 micrograms/ml with 5% granules and with 10% granules, respectively. At 8 hours after dosing, blood concentrations were 0.04-0.54 micrograms/ml at 3 mg/kg and 0.06-0.27 micrograms/ml at 6 mg/kg. Blood half-lives were 1.33-4.36 hours at 3 mg/kg and 1.14-3.27 hours at 6 mg/kg. AUC's were 1.7-11.0 micrograms.hr/ml with 3 mg/kg and 2.4-8.7 micrograms.hr/ml with 6 mg/kg. With administration of single 100 mg capsule, Cmax's, blood concentrations after 8 hours, T1/2's and AUC's were 0.79-1.88 micrograms/ml, 0.20 micrograms/ml, 1.54-2.72 hours, and 5.2 micrograms.hr/ml, respectively. Urinary recovery rates in the first 8 hours ranged from 6.85 to 39.2% with 3 mg/kg and 6.08-25.5% with 6 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  - In eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. The results showed that: a) in pure culture, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) Fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and/or Streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. It is concluded that Fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or known to be present in clinical specimens. This gnotobiotic animal model will be useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - Treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: state of the art.
AB  - Effective treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABE)  reduces the number of such exacerbations in such patients and may decrease or eliminate background symptoms and improve pulmonary function. The pathologic and physiologic abnormalities of the bronchial system in chronic bronchitis that predispose to bacterial infection probably include impaired mucociliary clearance, obstructed bronchioles, and bacterial infections of the bronchial epithelium. Exacerbations of bronchopulmonary symptoms are usually observed with ABE, although these symptoms are not unique to ABE. While culture and sensitivity testing is not usually required, microscopic examination of sputum is critical to determine the presence of bacterial infection. Bacteria in numbers significantly above the levels present when the patient's condition is stable and at least a doubling of the sputum neutrophil inflammatory level are essential criteria. Bacterial species observed with ABE include Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria species, with a lesser incidence of Klebsiella and Pseudomonas species. One or more elements of background therapy for ABE should accompany antimicrobial therapy, for example, physiotherapy, bronchodilators, and so forth. Ampicillin is effective, safe, economical, and thus remains the drug of choice for ABE. Quinolones are an effective alternative when ampicillin cannot be tolerated or if organisms are resistant. Dosing is at the upper range of recommendations, and the chosen drug should be given for a 10-14-day regimen. Patients should be reevaluated if symptoms and physical findings do not return to baseline after 5-7 days.
TI  - [Bactericidal effect of cefadroxil, amoxicillin alone or in combination with clavulanic acid in sera of healthy volunteers].
AB  - Determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) provides data on the susceptibility or resistance of a bacteria; however, in susceptible bacteria this parameter is not predictive of effectiveness of the antimicrobial agent. Bactericidal activities of cefadroxil, of amoxicillin, and of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on bacteria commonly found in ENT and lower respiratory tract disease were studied comparatively. The antibiotics were given by the oral route to six healthy volunteers. With beta-lactamase-producing and non-beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, amoxicillin produced MICs consistent with susceptibility but failed to exhibit a bactericidal effect, whereas cefadroxil was bactericidal. Combination of amoxicillin with an inhibitor did not modify this activity on E. coli and failed to produce a bactericidal effect on Klebsiella pneumoniae similar to that seen with cefadroxil. Amoxicillin with and without clavulanic acid exhibited comparable effectiveness on Streptococcus pyogenes and S. Pneumoniae. The bactericidal effect of cefadroxil on S. pneumoniae was of similar magnitude but shorter duration than that of amoxicillin. Cefadroxil and the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination had similar bactericidal effects against Staphylococcus aureus. These antibiotics exhibited a time-dependent effect on Gram positive microorganisms. These pharmacodynamic data, together with measures of bactericidal activity, may be very helpful for selecting the appropriate antibiotic and dosage.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents, 1989. A study mainly focused on imipenem. The Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibilities of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1989. The susceptibility testing was carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: (+++), (++), (+) and (-). IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis and had rather strong activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Achromobacter xylosoxidans, but was less active to Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Xanthomonas maltophilia. IPM has been found to have activities superior to those of other antibiotics tested against E. faecalis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and B. fragilis. No antibiotics tested showed good activities against MRSA except minocycline.
TI  - Bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.
AB  - Infections are frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis, as their defenses against infectious agents are altered. But bacteremia occurring in cirrhotic patients has seldom been reported in the literature. From 1981 to 1986, we collected 197 cases with 228 episodes of bacteremia for this retrospective study. The incidence of bacteremia in cirrhotic patients was 8.8%; no significant difference was noted between cirrhotic patients with variant etiologies of HBV(+), HBV(-) and alcohol. But the incidence increased with the severity of the disease (1%, 4.8%, 17.1% in Child's A, B, C groups, respectively). Gram-negative bacteria were the predominant microorganisms of bacteremia (75.6%). Among them, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Aeromonas hydrophilia were the three most commonly detected microorganisms. Gram-positive bacterias were detected in 21.2% of patients with bacteremia, with predominance of the Streptococcus group and Staphylococcus aureus. In about 26.3% of cases the infectious sources were the same by bacteria cultures as from blood. The most common sources were spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia and biliary tree infection. In cirrhotic patients with and without bacteremia, the mortality rate increased significantly in the bacteremia group (54.8% vs 23.2%, P less than 0.05). By Child's classification, the mortality of patients with classes B and C increased significantly after onset of bacteremia. There was no significant difference in mortality between bacteremic patients in the HBV(+), HBV(-) and alcohol groups. In conclusion, bacteremia is a severe complication of liver cirrhosis and a sign of a poor prognosis.
TI  - Drug treatment of pneumonia in the hospital. What are the choices?
AB  - Mortality and morbidity of nosocomial pneumonia remain high. Successful treatment of pulmonary infections depends on several factors including type of infection, offending pathogen, status of host defences, and adequate choice of antibiotic therapy. The physician's decision should aim at achieving antibiotic concentrations beyond the MIC at the site of infection. Gram-negative bacilli, notably Pseudomonos aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, remain the most frequent agents in nosocomial pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae predominate among the Gram-positive cocci. Pneumocystis carinii predominates in immunocompromised patients. Protected sample bronchoscopy associated with quantitative cultures of samples, and quantification of intracellular microorganisms in cells recovered by broncho-alveolar lavage are two promising procedures which might replace previous, more aggressive methods. Penetration of antibiotics into lung tissue depends on physicochemical properties of the drug and the degree of inflammation of lung tissue. Quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines and trimethoprim penetrate well into bronchial secretions. Penetration is moderate to low for aminoglycosides and beta-lactams. Fluoroquinolones and new beta-lactam agents, including third-generation cephalosporins imipenem, aztreonam and ticarcillin-clavulanate, showed comparative clinical efficacy in treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, with an efficacy rate close to 80%. Aminoglycosides should not be used alone. Combination therapy reduces but does not eliminate the risk of selection of Gram-negative resistant mutants. It should not be used routinely except for P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae and Serratia marcescens infections.
TI  - Clinical & bacteriological profile of neonatal pneumonia.
AB  - In a prospective study of 44 neonates (33 outborn and 11 inborn) with pneumonia,  the bacteriology of pneumonia was determined by blood culture and serum counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). Twenty-nine babies also underwent lung aspiration. The lung aspirate was subjected to bacterial culture and CIEP. CIEP was done to detect the bacterial antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Absence of tachypnoea, found more commonly in low birth weight babies, was a poor prognostic sign. Low birth weight babies had a significantly higher mortality than babies with normal birth weight. Altogether, a bacterial etiology of neonatal pneumonia could be established in 25 cases (56.7%). In 10 babies, Strep. pneumoniae antigen was detected in serum and/or lung aspirate. Micro-organisms were cultured from blood and/or lung aspirate from 17 babies. Eleven babies (25%) grew Gram negative bacteria. The common bacteria identified in decreasing order of frequency were Strep. pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinatobacter lowfii, Staph. aureus, Pseudoamonas aeruginosa etc. All the Gram negative bacteria as well as staphylococci were sensitive to amikacin while only 23.5 per cent was sensitive to gentamicin. All staphylococci isolated were sensitive to methicillin.
TI  - Long-acting chloramphenicol versus intravenous ampicillin for treatment of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - In most developing countries, bacterial meningitis (BM) is associated with a high case-fatality rate. The search for a simple, convenient, and inexpensive antibiotic treatment remains a priority. In this study, a non-blinded, multicentre, randomised clinical trial of 528 cases of BM was done in two hospitals in Mali and Niger, between March, 1989, and May, 1990, to see whether a double injection of long-acting chloramphenicol (on admission to hospital and 48 h later) is as effective as a course of intravenous ampicillin (8 days, 4 times a day). The cumulative case-fatality rate on day 4 (principal end-point) among the chloramphenicol (254 patients) and ampicillin (274) groups were, respectively, 28% and 24.5% (relative risk 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.86-1.52). No outbreak occurred during the study period. The hospital case-fatality rate was 33.1%. Main risk factors for death were associated with clinical condition on admission--ie, altered consciousness, convulsions, or dehydration. The case-fatality rates were 13% (21/161) for Neisseria meningitidis, 36.1% (48/133) for Haemophilus influenzae, and 67% (77/115) for Streptococcus pneumoniae. In a multiple logistic regression model, controlling for the differential distribution of potential risk factors (including bacterial species), there was no difference between treatment groups. Our findings suggest that long-acting chloramphenicol is a useful first-line presumptive treatment for BM in high-incidence countries.
TI  - Clinical results of a multicenter study with sulbactam/ampicillin for the treatment of patients with lower respiratory and urinary tract infections.
AB  - A total of 124 patients with lower respiratory tract (44) or urinary tract infections (80) were enrolled in an open, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam/ampicillin, administered at the dosage of 3 g/die by intramuscular route. Pretreatment pathogens from patients with lower respiratory tract infections included: Streptococcus alpha-haemolyticus in 8 cases, Streptococcus beta-haemolyticus in 2 cases, Staphylococcus albus in 7 cases, Haemophilus influenzae in 7 cases, Staphylococcus aureus in 6 cases, Klebsiella oxytoca in 5 cases, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 3 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3 cases, Escherichia coli in 2 cases; in one subject (2.75%), no microorganisms were isolated. In vitro, 36 isolates (84%) were sensitive to SA and 7 (16%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, all the causative pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated. In patients with urinary tract infections, pretreatment pathogens were: E. coli in 40 cases, S. albus in 16 cases, Proteus mirabilis in 8 cases, Enterobacter agglomerans in 6 cases, Proteus vulgaris in 3 cases, Streptococcus faecalis in 3 cases, Streptococcus liquefaciens in 2 cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2 cases. In vitro, 64 isolates (80%) were sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin and 16 (20%) were resistant. At the end of therapy, 63 out of the 64 pathogens sensitive to sulbactam/ampicillin were eliminated; in one case the therapy was interrupted due to adverse effect. Clinical efficacy: in subjects with lower respiratory tract infections, sulbactam/ampicillin cured 32 patients (72.72%) and ameliorated the clinical status of 8 patients (18.18%); efficacy rate: 90.9%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  - To better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. Sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). We cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, Streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, Staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group D streptococcus in five patients, Corynebacterium in five patients, Haemophilus influenzae in three patients, Neisseria in three patients, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, group A streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. Cultures yielded no growth in nine patients. A strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. A poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). All seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. Only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. Cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. The presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.
TI  - The differential effect of cigarette smoke on the growth of bacteria found in humans.
AB  - The effect of cigarette smoke on growth of those species of bacteria that are considered common potential human pathogens was examined in vitro. Smoke from both mentholated and nonmentholated cigarettes inhibited the growth of Gram-positive cocci to a greater degree than that of Gram-negative rods. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a variety of other streptococci were inhibited at a smoke solution dilution of 1:8. Enteric bacteria such as Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas were not affected by a 1:1 dilution of the solution. As with the Gram-positive cocci, the Neisseria species and Branhamella were also inhibited at a dilution of 1:8. Culture results of the mouth of 15 smokers and 15 nonsmokers showed that the smokers have a propensity to develop heavy Gram-negative bacterial colonization.
TI  - Postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.
TI  - Cefpodoxime: comparative antibacterial activity, influence of growth conditions,  and bactericidal activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime, the active metabolite of the new cephalosporin ester cefpodoxime proxetil, in comparison to cefixime, cefotiam, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime was determined against a broad spectrum of freshly isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. Cefpodoxime was demonstrated to be inhibitory at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 90% of strains of Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli (beta-lactamase- negative strains), Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia spp., and Salmonella spp. This antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was generally superior to that of cefuroxime and similar to that of cefixime. Cefpodoxime was active at less than or equal to 1 mg/l against 50% of the members of beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter spp., and Morganella morganii. Cefpodoxime proved to be highly inhibitory against group A, B, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 less than 0.015 mg/l). The MICs of cefpodoxime and those of the other cephalosporins were less than 2 mg/l for greater than or equal to 90% of the strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, with the exception of cefixime which had no activity with MICs below 8 mg/l against these bacteria. Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. were resistant to cefpodoxime. The antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime was only to a minor degree influenced by different growth conditions with the exception of high inoculum sizes against some beta-lactamase producing strains of gram-negative bacilli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Otitis media in Sudanese children: presentation and bacteriology.
AB  - Two hundred Sudanese children (105 males, 95 females) with otitis media (OM) were studied. Their age range was from 3 months to 15 years, with 41.5% being below 2 years of age. The presenting symptoms included ear discharge in 96% and pyrexia in 26.5% of patients. Ear ache and itching were reported in 22.5% and 7.0% respectively and impaired hearing in 7.0%. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from 115 (70.1%) of 164 cultures from children with chronic discharging ears. Organisms isolated in order of frequency were: Proteus species, Klebsiella with other coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. Sixty of 84 (71.4%) cultures from children with acute OM grew pathogenic bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella with other coliforms were the commonest pathogens. Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were less frequent but beta-haemolytic Streptococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli were the least common. Antibiotic sensitivity results show that the majority of isolates from children with discharging ears were sensitive to Gentamicin, followed by Co-trimoxazole and Streptomycin. The majority of organisms showed poor sensitivity to Ampicillin and Penicillin. The results of this study show that cotrimoxazole is the drug of choice for treating children with OM.
TI  - Peritonitis in children with nephrotic syndrome.
AB  - In a retrospective review of 300 children with nephrotic syndrome seen at National Taiwan University Hospital throughout the 12-year period from 1978 to 1990, 20 episodes of peritonitis were identified in 17 patients (7.4%). Gram-negative bacilli (E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were the majority of pathogens, accounting for 55% of all the cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae were cultured from only 15% of the patients. An additional 15% had negative culture results, but were clinically responsive to penicillin. In 15% of cases the cause was unknown. Clinically, peritonitis was characterized by abdominal pain (100%), abdominal tenderness (100%), rebounding pain (85%), leukocytosis (85%), and fever (75%). Based on this data, it seems reasonable to initiate antimicrobial therapy in nephrotic children with suspected peritonitis, using a combination of penicillin plus either an aminoglycoside or a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. This regimen should be continued until culture results are available.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Cefaclor in the treatment of infective exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers.
AB  - There is a direct correlation between number of cigarettes smoked and the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection in humans. In studies with smokers suffering from exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the most common bacterial pathogens found were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Branhamella catarrhalis. Antibiotics should be effective against such possible pathogens. Cefaclor has demonstrated in vitro activity against all these pathogens. We designed the present study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cefaclor in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in cigarette smokers. A total of 106 patients were enrolled in the study. H. influenzae was the most common bacterial species isolated in the sputum (in 23.6% of the total sample), followed by S. pneumoniae (18.9%), S. aureus (17.0%), K. pneumoniae (7.5%) and B. catarrhalis (5.7%), while mixed forms were present in 22.6% of cases and other pathogens in 4.7%. Cefaclor (500 mg) was given orally every 8h for 7 to 16 days (mean 10.73 +/- 2.11). Analysis of clinical response data indicates that 75.5% of patients were cured and 17.0% improved. This finding is important because it demonstrates that cefaclor's spectrum of activity encompasses all the most likely pathogens encountered in smokers. Because of its excellent response rate, cefaclor is of particular value in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in cigarette smokers.
TI  - In vitro activity of cefcanel versus other oral cephalosporins.
AB  - Cefcanel is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. Its activity was compared with that of cefuroxime, cefaclor, cephalexin, and cefixime against gram-positive and negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Cefcanel had excellent activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, MIC90 1 micrograms/ml, superior to the other oral cephalosporins. However, methicillin-resistant staphylococci were resistant, MIC greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.015-1 micrograms/ml, concentrations comparable to other cephalosporins. Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml, 8- to 128-fold lower concentrations than were found for other agents, but the MICs were greater than 64 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides spp. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 1 micrograms/ml, similar to cefuroxime but 16-fold greater than the MICs of cefixime. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia which were high beta-lactamase producers were resistant, MICs greater than 64 micrograms/ml, and 50% of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii were resistant. Cefcanel was hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-3 and Moraxella Bro-1 beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli containing TEM-1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 had cefcanel MICs of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Although cefcanel inhibited gram-positive species as well as or at lower concentrations than other cephalosporins, it lacked activity against gram-negative species that produced common plasmid beta-lactamase although it inhibited Haemophilus influenzae carrying TEM-1.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 09-1428 compared to other cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 09-1428, a new catechol-type parenteral cephalosporin, was compared to that of ceftazidime, E-1040, cefpirome and cefepime against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Ro 09-1428 inhibited group A streptococci at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, and group B, C and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.5 micrograms/ml, whereas for Staphylococcus aureus Ro 09-1428 had MICs of 8-16 micrograms/ml similar to ceftazidime and E-1040. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ro 09-1428 was the most active agent, inhibiting isolates at less than or equal to 0.12-2 micrograms/ml, and inhibited ceftazidime-resistant isolates. The majority of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, Providencia, Salmonella and Shigella were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml as with the other cephalosporins. For most Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae Ro 09-1428 had higher MICs of 4-16 micrograms/ml; most ceftazidime-resistant isolates of these species were resistant. Anaerobes, enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes were resistant to Ro 09-1428. Ro 09-1428 was not hydrolyzed by TEM-1, TEM-2, Staphylococcus aureus PC-1, Moraxella catarrhalis Bro-1, Enterobacter P-99, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Sabath-Abraham or Klebsiella beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-7 and TEM-9. Ro 09-1428 was markedly less active at an acid pH.
TI  - [Role of cefuroxime-axetil in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. Bacteriological and pharmacological data].
AB  - Cefuroxime-axetil, the 1-acetoxyethyl ester of cefuroxime, is a prodrug for oral  administration. The indication of this new formulation in the treatment of community acquired RTI required an updating of its activity against respiratory pathogens. A total of 260 isolates were included in a study using MIC determination (agar dilution technique): the mode MICs for Haemophilus spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, streptococci, S. pneumoniae ranged from 0.016 to 0.5 mg/l; no difference was noted between beta-lactamase producers and non producers in Haemophilus and B. catarrhalis; coagulase positive staphylococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae isolated from RTI exhibited mode MICs not exceeding 4 mg/l (except for methicillin-R staphylococci mode MIC greater than 128 mg/l). Simultaneously the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined in healthy volunteers after a loading dose (500 mg) of the drug: 7 consecutive samples collected after a light meal provided the following data: Cmax = 7.77 +/- 2.2 mg/l; Tmax = 2.33 +/- 0.23 hrs; t1/2 beta = 1.18 +/- 0.19 hrs; AUC = 22.17 +/- 6.4 h.mg/l. Cmax and AUC were half of these values after administration of 250 mg. These results, together with the known intrinsic beta-lactamase stability of cefuroxime, should ensure sufficient in vivo concentrations and effective in vivo antibacterial activity against most respiratory pathogens after oral administration of cefuroxime-axetil.
TI  - Rufloxacin once daily in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - In this open study the efficacy and tolerability of rufloxacin in a single dose of 400 mg the first day and 200 mg the nine consecutive days was studied in 26 patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Twenty-two patients were evaluable for efficacy. Four patients stopped treatment prematurely after five days because of clinical cure. At the enrollment visit a pathogen was isolated in the sputum sample in 19 of 22 evaluable patients. The predominant pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis. In 17 of these 19 bacteriologically evaluable patients the initial infecting organism was eradicated from specimens obtained within 48 hours after the end of therapy. There was one case of persistent infection caused by S. pneumoniae (MIC 4 mg/l), one patient had a superinfection with Serratia marcescens (MIC 1 mg/l) susceptible to rufloxacin and therapy was stopped after five days due to clinical failure. One week after the end of therapy, 15 patients remained free from infection whilst one patient experienced reinfection with Klebsiella pneumoniae (MIC 0.5 mg/l). Clinical cure or improvement was observed in 21 of 22 patients. Mild adverse events were reported by two of 26 enrolled patients. In one patient, complaining of headache and dizziness, the adverse events were considered possibly study drug related. No abnormal laboratory findings were reported. Nadir plasma levels of rufloxacin were measured and no accumulation in plasma was observed during treatment. A ten day course of an oral single dose of rufloxacin proved efficacious and was well tolerated in patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infectious  diseases to antibiotics (1988)].
AB  - Isolated bacteria from respiratory infectious diseases were collected in cooperation with institutions located throughout Japan, since 1981, and Ikemoto et al. have been examining sensitivities of the isolates to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics, relationships between the isolates and the backgrounds of the patients and so forth each year. We report here the research results for the year 1988. In 18 institutions around the entire Japan from October 1988 to September 1989, 554 strains of bacteria were isolated mainly from the sputa of 439 patients with respiratory infectious diseases and assumed to be the etiologic bacteria. MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics against 68 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 102 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 120 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 86 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 65 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 18 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and so forth, were determined, and the drug sensitivities of these strains were examined except for the strains which died during transportation. The drug sensitivities of the main strains were almost the same as those determined last year for each drug. However, S. aureus strains for which MICs of methicillin were higher than 12.5 micrograms/ml (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) accounted for 38.2%, and the frequency of drug resistant bacteria increased over last year's 18.2%. Also, we examined changes in the backgrounds of patients, the infectious diseases, and the etiologic bacteria and so forth. As to patient backgrounds, there were many infectious diseases found in a high age bracket, and the patients over age 60 accounted for 57.2% of the diseases. In the distribution by disease, bacterial pneumonia and chronic bronchitis accounted for greatest numbers of cases 32.1% and 31.4%, respectively, followed by bronchiectasis and bronchial asthma. As for frequencies of etiologic bacteria by disease, S. aureus (22.5%) and S. pneumoniae (15.4%) in pneumonia, S. pneumoniae (25.7%) and H. influenzae (24.1%) in chronic bronchitis, H. influenzae (32.5%) and P. aeruginosa (23.8%) in bronchiectasis, and H. influenzae (31.4%), S. pneumoniae and B. catarrhalis (20.0%) in bronchial asthma were the most frequent. Regarding effects of administration of antibiotics and isolates obtained on each day after infection, those bacteria which were isolated before antibiotic administration and which decreased after administration included S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and B. catarrhalis. Frequencies of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, however, increased after antibiotic administration. Also, when dosing continued for more than 15 days, the frequency of P. aeruginosa increased rapidly.
TI  - [Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: occurrence in chronic liver disease patients  in Recife].
AB  - A prospective research was made on spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in chronic liver disease patients presenting with ascites. Forty clinical cases, of 37 patients, were analysed. All subjects were submitted to clinical and laboratory evaluation and diagnostic paracentesis, and the material was obtained for biochemical dosages, pH determination, cytology and bacterial cultures. Thirty cases of sterile ascites and 10 of SBP (25%) were detected. In 5 (50%) with SBP, the clinical findings were characteristic, with fever, abdominal pain and rebound tenderness. In 2 patients (20%) the presentation was atypical, without the complete triad described above. Finally in 3 (30%) SBP was silent, without any suggestive clinical manifestations of infection. In 7 cases (70%) cultures were positives; Streptococcus pneumoniae (3 cases), Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus negative coagulase, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). In 7 (70%) SBP cases, the patients were admitted already infected in the hospital. Lethality in the SBP group was 30% and in the sterile ascites was 13.3%. We concluded that SBP is a frequent cause of morbid-lethality in patients with ascites and chronic hepatopathy, presenting itself often in a typical clinical manifestations.
TI  - Community acquired pneumonia: aetiology and prognostic index evaluation.
AB  - A 10 month prospective study of all adults admitted to Waikato Hospital with community acquired pneumonia was performed to assess aetiology, mortality, hospital stay, and the value of a prognostic index based on that obtained from a British Thoracic Society study. The 92 patients in the survey had a mean age of 56 (range 13-97) years. A microbiological diagnosis was established in 72%; Streptococcus pneumoniae (33%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (18%), and influenza A virus (8%) were the most common microorganisms. Other causative organisms were Legionella pneumophila (4 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Nocardia brasiliensis (1), and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (1). Chlamydia sp, influenza B virus and adenovirus were each found in one case; all were cultured on nasopharygeal aspirates. Aspiration was considered to be the underlying cause in five patients, two with epilepsy and one with pseudobulbar palsy. Five of the six deaths that occurred were in patients over 75 years of age and the other was 69. In four of the six the established causative organisms were Chlamydia sp (1), K pneumoniae (1), and S aureus (2). Patients had a 16 fold increased risk of death if they had two or more of the following on admission: a respiratory rate of 30/minute or more, diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and either confusion or a plasma urea concentration greater than 7.0 mmol/l.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of Legionella infection by a nonisotopic in situ hybridization method.
AB  - The authors report a nonradioactive adaptation of DNA hybridization technology for the direct detection of Legionella organisms in situ in routinely processed histologic specimens. The probe used consisted of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, complementary to the ribosomal RNA of all clinically relevant Legionella species, labeled with biotinylated dUTP at their 3' ends. By in situ DNA hybridization and detection with an avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex. Legionella was visualized by light microscopy within the alveoli of lung specimens in 9 of 13 direct fluorescent antibody- or culture-positive cases of Legionnaires' disease. No cross-hybridization was observed in lung specimens infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or other pathogens. The authors' results illustrate a novel adaptation of in situ DNA hybridization techniques, usually used for viruses, to the detection of a bacterial organism. The method enables direct visualization of bacterial nucleic acid in infected tissues and may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of legionellosis.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in an urological department. Incidence and etiological factors].
AB  - The authors report a prospective study with active request of data for nosocomial infections (NI) in an urological department during six months. From 453 patients, 43 developed an NI (incidence = 9.5%): urinary tract infections (53.5%), bloodstream infections (16.3%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), surgical wound infections (2.3%) and sepsis syndrome (20.9%). For microorganisms, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.5%) and E. coli (20%) were encountered. Other microorganisms were the next-ones: Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7.5%), Acinetobacter baumanii (7.5%), Streptococcus group D (7.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), Candida albicans (2.5%) and others (10%). Urological interventions with a high risk of NI were cystectomy with intestinal urinary diversion (68.7%), pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (40%) and percutaneous nephrolitothomy (30%). Even if the last two interventions classically do not have a high risk of NI, we think that their antibioprophylaxis is recommended.
TI  - [Combined antibacterial activity of aztreonam and clindamycin against clinically  isolated strains].
AB  - It has been reported in some studies that the combination of aztreonam (AZT) and  clindamycin (CLDM) have high clinical effectiveness in the treatment of intractable infections. We, therefore, studied combined in vitro antibacterial activity of these 2 compounds using many freshly isolated strains. 1. AZT and CLDM in combination had synergistic effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, which are sensitive or quasi-sensitive to CLDM, in the presence of CLDM at MIC or sub-MIC. 2. For Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are not sensitive to CLDM, the 2 drugs in combination showed synergistic effects on some species and additive or slightly additive effects on most species in the presence of CLDM at those concentrations which are usually maintained in blood. 3. The 2 drugs showed no antagonism.
TI  - Bacterial colonisation of humidifier attachments on oxygen concentrators prescribed for long term oxygen therapy: a district review.
AB  - A microbiological survey was undertaken on the eight patients in the Liverpool District who have a humidifier attachment on their oxygen concentrator. All but one of the humidifiers were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with high antipseudomonal activity.
AB  - Ro 09-1428, a new parenteral cephalosporin with a catechol moiety attached at position 7 of the cephalosporin ring, showed high in vitro activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, and Streptococcus pyogenes, with MICs for 90% of strains tested (MIC90s) of less than or equal to 0.39 micrograms/ml. Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited with MIC90s of less than or equal to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Serratia marcescens was less susceptible to Ro 09-1428, with a MIC90 of 25 micrograms/ml. The most distinctive feature of Ro 09-1428 was its potent activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, with MIC90s of 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Most of the ceftazidime-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, and C. freundii were inhibited by Ro 09-1428, while those of S. marcescens were resistant at a concentration of 12.5 micrograms/ml. Ro 09-1428 was more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci. PBP 3 was the most sensitive target in E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The response to ferric iron in growth medium suggests that Ro 09-1428 may be taken up by transport mechanisms similar to those of other catechol cephalosporins. In accordance with its in vitro activity, Ro 09-1428 activity was equal to or greater than ceftazidime activity in efficacy against experimental septicemias in mice. The results indicate that Ro 09-1428 is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with advantages over ceftazidime in its activity against P. aeruginosa, staphylococci, and ceftazidime-resistant strains of C. freundii and E. cloacae.
TI  - [Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of cefpirome in the field  of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological, pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Antibacterial activities of CPR against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were superior to those of ceftazidime. 2. Plasma concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CPR at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 2 cases each were determined. Mean peak plasma concentrations of CPR at these dose levels were 33.9, 62.9 and 96.0 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes with plasma half-lives of 1.58, 1.69, and 2.13 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates in the first 8 hours after administration were 51.2, 78.0 and 74.9%, respectively. 3. Ten patients with bacterial infections (pneumonia 5 cases, urinary tract infection 5 cases) were treated with CPR at a daily dose of 16-79 mg/kg/day. The overall clinical efficacy and bacteriological eradication rates were both 100%. 4. No adverse reactions were observed except in 1 case of mild pain in blood vessels. Abnormal laboratory test results were also mild, slight elevation of GOT, GPT and thrombocytosis in 1 case and eosinophilia in 1 case.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies of cefodizime in pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem  developed by Hoechst AG and Roussel Uclaf, were carried out and the results are summarized below: 1. Against Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to those of cefotaxime (CTX), cefazolin, cefotiam and piperacillin. Against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., antibacterial activities of CDZM were similar to that of CTX, and superior to those of other tested antibiotics. Especially against Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis, it showed an excellent antibacterial activity. 2. Although the clinical efficacy was poor in 1 patient with sepsis caused by Salmonella marcescens and in another with cervical lymphadenitis, in 5 patients with upper respiratory tract infection, 4 patients with bronchitis, 6 patients with bronchopneumonia, 18 patients with pneumonia, 5 patients with urinary tract infection and 1 patient with enteritis, the clinical efficacy was excellent or good and the efficacy rate was 95.1% (39/41) including excellent efficacies in 25 cases. 3. Bacteriologically, all identified causative bacteria were eradicated except for 1 case of Salmonella sp., thus the eradication rate was 97.4% (38/39). Especially S. pneumoniae in 10 cases, H. influenzae in 12 cases and B. catarrhalis in 3 cases were eradicated totally. 4. Adverse reactions were studied in 46 cases, and digestive symptoms were observed in 9 cases (diarrhea 5 cases, loose stools 4 cases). Eruption and vascular pain were observed in 1 case each. As digestive symptoms in 9 cases were mild, the treatment were not suspended. In laboratory test values, elevation of GOT, elevation of GPT, elevation of bilirubin, and eosinophilia were observed in 1 case each. Influences on blood coagulation parameters were studied. No change was observed between the beginning and the end of the treatment. From above results, we have concluded that CDZM is a useful and safe antibiotic in pediatrics, administered at a daily dose of 20 mg/kg divided into 3 or 4 doses and administered intravenously.
TI  - [Epidemiologic and etiologic study of acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years of age].
AB  - This study also included epidemiologic data to determine the risk factors for the enhancement of these infections. The coagglutination technique for the rapid diagnosis of streptococcus was tried. Five hundred and thirty one samples of pharingeal swabs were obtained from children with ARI. 74% were younger than one year old. Brochopneumonias constituted 66.39% of the cases. In total 357 agents were isolated 35% corresponding to bacteria in pure culture, 23.3% to mixed infections and 11.6% only viruses. The bacteria were: Haemphilus influenza (12.4%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11%), Staphylococcus aureus (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.3%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae was identified in 5 children and M. hominis in 3. Adenoviruses were isolated in 98 patients, parainfluenza in 19, respiratory syncytial virus in 4, influenza in 1 and picornavirus in 2. Predominating socioeconomic factors were: overcrowding, deficient schooling and low income of parents which favor malnutrition. The more frequent agents were constitutes by bacteria. Viruses were a less cause of infection. It was confirmed that babies under 12 months are more susceptible to bacterial pneumonia and prompt treatment with antimicrobial agents lowered the lethality. Low socioeconomic level is a possible predisposing factor for respiratory diseases.
TI  - Viable but nonculturable bacteria in drinking water.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Streptococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas strains L2 and 719 were tested for the ability to grow and maintain viability in drinking water. Microcosms were employed in the study to monitor growth and survival by plate counts, acridine orange direct counts (AODC), and direct viable counts (DVC). Plate counts dropped below the detection limit within 7 days for all strains except those of Bacillus and Pseudomonas. In all cases, the AODC did not change. The DVC also did not change except that the DVC, on average, were ca. 10-fold lower than the AODC.
TI  - Activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. MICs for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. Temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes. Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bordetella pertussis. Against Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively. When administered orally in mouse protection tests against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and S. pyogenes, temafloxacin was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin. Against H. influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice. In treating L. pneumophila in guinea pigs and H. influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin. Against S. pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin. Following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.
TI  - Viability and distribution of bacteria after passage through a circle anaesthetic system.
AB  - We have assessed in vitro the viability of eight species of micro-organism suspended as aerosols and passed through a soda-lime absorber rebreathing system. As had been predicted, the soda-lime exerted a potent cidal effect on non-sporing organisms, all of which were rendered non-viable. One percent of the spore bearing organism, Bacillus subtilis, was still viable after 30 min contact. Although Bacillus subtilis is an organism of low pathogenicity, spores may be more resistant to the alkaline medium of the soda-lime. The micro-organisms were observed to lodge in all components of the breathing system, with the greatest concentration being recovered from the corrugated tubing. We recommend that disposable components of the circle breathing system should be changed, and the non-disposable parts sterilized or disinfected, daily. Soda-lime cannisters should be sterilized or disinfected when changing the soda-lime.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetical and clinical study of cefpirome in children].
AB  - This study describes the pharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical usefulness  of cefpirome (CPR) in children. Mean half-lives of 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg of CPR injected intravenously in one shot were 1.18 and 1.34 hours, respectively, and their mean recovery rates into urine were 69.8 and 72.2%, respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of CPR against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae were the same as or lower than those of ceftazidime. CPR was clinically effective in 14/15 of patients with bacterial infections; 8/9 of pneumonia, 2/2 of bronchitis, 1/1 of pharyngitis, 1/1 of tonsillitis, 1/1 of osteomyelitis, 1/1 of urinary tract infection. No clinically overt side effects of CPR were found, while an increase of eosinophils in blood was observed in 2 cases, and an increase of platelet in blood in 1 case and an elevation of serum GPT activity in 1 case were also observed. These findings indicate that CPR is useful for the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of GR69153, a new long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - GR69153, a new parenteral cephalosporin, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, shigellae, and salmonellae at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml (MIC90). It had activity comparable to those of ceftazidime, cefpirome, cefepime, and E-1040. Against cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens, MICs ranged from 0.12 to greater than 32 micrograms/ml, and cefpirome and cefepime were the most active agents against these species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was highly susceptible to GR69153, and for this organism the MIC90 was less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, which was similar to the E-1040 MIC90, but most Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia isolates were resistant. GR69153 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella branhamella at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. For Staphylococcus aureus GR69153 MICs were similar to those of ceftazidime and E-1040. Enterococci and listeriae were resistant to GR69153, but Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml. The activity of GR69153 was not affected by serum. GR69153 was not inactivated by the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus, TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, and BRO-1, but it was hydrolyzed by TEM-3, TEM-9, and morganellae. GR69153 had overall activity comparable to those of commercially available parenteral cephalosporins or those found in clinical investigations. It is more active against bacteroides than most available aminothiazolyl parenteral cephalosporins are. GR69153 is hydrolyzed by the new plasmid beta-lactamases, and thus, its primary value may be related to its pharmacological properties.
TI  - Analysis of the lacZ sequences from two Streptococcus thermophilus strains: comparison with the Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus bulgaricus beta-galactosidase sequences.
AB  - The lacZ gene from Streptococcus thermophilus A054, a commercial yogurt strain, was cloned on a 7.2 kb PstI fragment in Escherichia coli and compared with the previously cloned lacZ gene from S. thermophilus ATCC 19258. Using the dideoxy chain termination method, the DNA sequences of both lacZ structural genes were determined and found to be 3071 bp in length. When the two sequences were more closely analysed, 21 nucleotide differences were detected, of which only nine resulted in amino acid changes in the proteins, the remainder occurring in wobble positions of the respective codons. Only three bases separated the termination codon for the lacS gene from the initiation codon for lacZ, suggesting that the lactose utilization genes are organized as an operon. The amino acid sequence of the beta-galactosidase, derived from the DNA sequence, corresponds to a protein with a molecular mass of 116860 Da. Comparison of the S. thermophilus amino acid sequences with those from Lactobacillus bulgaricus, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed 48, 35 and 32.5% identity respectively. Although little sequence homology was observed at the DNA level, many regions conserved in the amino acid sequence were identified when the beta-galactosidase proteins from S. thermophilus, E. coli and L. bulgaricus were compared.
TI  - Open randomized controlled parallel study of ofloxacin versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole treatment of lower respiratory tract and urinary infections.
AB  - A total of 60 patients with lower respiratory tract or urinary tract infections were enrolled in an open, randomized, controlled, parallel study comparing 300 mg ofloxacin (OFX) b.i.d. with trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole (TMP 800 mg + SMX 160 mg), 1 tablet, b.i.d. The signs and symptoms of low respiratory tract infection were cured in 12 patients (80%) of the OFX group and improved in 2 other patients (13%); at the end of therapy, the 2 germs that persisted were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical cure was achieved in 13 patients (86%) in the TMP-SMX group, while 2 patients were considered as failures (14%); after therapy, the 3 organisms that persisted were 2 S. pneumoniae and 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As far as urinary tract infections are concerned clinical cure and complete eradication of bacteria were achieved in 14 patients in the OFX group (93%); the germ that persisted was Escherichia coli (100,000 CFU), but the patient was asymptomatic. In patients of the TMP-SMX group the urinary infections were cured in 11 subjects (73%); the germs that persisted were 2 E. coli and 1 Proteus mirabilis. Adverse effects were reported for 3 patients (10%) in the OFX group and 4 patients (13%) in the TMP-SMX group. The measurement of serum and intracellular (polymorphonuclear cells and lymphocytes) levels of OFX and TMP-SMX and the assessment of the host's immunocompetence ruled out the possibility of any immunotoxicological side effect.
TI  - Ceftibuten and bactericidal kinetics. Comparative in vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  - Ceftibuten, compared to cefixime, cefetamet, cefpodoxime, loracarbef, cefprozil,  cefuroxime, cefaclor, and cefadroxil, was the most active oral cephalosporin derivative against Enterobacteriaceae producing plasmid-encoded broad spectrum beta-lactamases. In a pharmacodynamic model, ceftibuten was bactericidal for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations simulating human serum levels following 200 mg, p.o., b.i.d.
TI  - The effect of antimicrobial therapy on mixed infections with Bacteroides species. Is eradication of the anaerobes important?
AB  - Antimicrobial agents were used alone or in combinations in order to explore their effect on mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections. Subcutaneous abscesses were induced in mice by single and mixed infections of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected animals were treated for 5 days with spiramycin, gentamicin or metronidazole alone, or metronidazole combined with spiramycin or gentamicin. Animals were killed 5 days after inoculation and the bacterial contents of the abscesses determined. Infection induced by a single species of bacteria always responded to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In infections caused by two species of organisms, however, therapy directed at either the Bacteroides sp. (with metronidazole) or the aerobes or facultative anaerobes (with spiramycin or gentamicin) was effective not only in significantly reducing the numbers of the target organism but also, in 13 of 24 instances, in reducing to a small extent the numbers of the other bacteria. Despite this phenomenon, in no instance did therapy with a single agent eliminate the infection and eradicate the untargeted organism. The combination of spiramycin and metronidazole increased the reduction in numbers of B. melaninogenicus in single-organism infections and of Bacteroides sp. in mixed infections with S. aureus and S. pyogenes. These findings support the need to aim treatment at all components of mixed infections.
TI  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime for treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
AB  - Intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime were compared for efficacy in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients with nosocomial pneumonia were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin (as the lactate salt) 300 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime (with sodium carbonate) 2 g i.v. every eight hours. Patients with UTI were randomized to receive ciprofloxacin 200 mg i.v. every 12 hours or ceftazidime 1 g i.v. every eight hours. Sputum and urine specimens were collected before, during, and after therapy. For patients with pneumonia, the organisms most frequently isolated before treatment began were Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis. Of the 17 pneumonia patients who completed ciprofloxacin treatment, 15 (88%) had resolution of signs and symptoms or improvement. Of the 15 ceftazidime-treated pneumonia patients, 13 (87%) had resolution or improvement. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Acinetobacter species, and K. pneumoniae infections persisted for the ciprofloxacin treatment failures. Infections by Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter species persisted for the ceftazidime treatment failures. For UTI patients, E. coli was the organism most frequently isolated before treatment. All 14 UTI patients who completed treatment showed resolution or improvement. In the ciprofloxacin group two patients were superinfected by Enterococcus species, and in the ceftazidime group there were two superinfections by Enterococcus species and one by Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous ciprofloxacin was as effective as ceftazidime in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Caution should be exercised when treating serious infections by streptococci or staphylococci.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem with stability to  dehydropeptidase I.
AB  - The activity of LJC10,627 was compared with the activities of imipenem and other  antibiotics. LJC10,627 was more active against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp. but slightly less active than imipenem against staphylococci and streptococci. LJC10,627 showed stability to mouse dehydropeptidase I and was more effective in vivo than imipenem plus cilastatin against gram-negative bacterial infections and as effective against staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Spontaneous contrast in the pericardial sac caused by gas-forming organisms.
AB  - Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disease associated with a variety of  microorganisms. The case presented herein has unusual manifestations of contrast echoes on two-dimensional echocardiography. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pericarditis caused by gas-forming group D Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae with pyopericardium, resulting in contrast echoes on the two-dimensional echocardiographic image.
TI  - [Pediatric bacteremia strains grow in blood culture media].
AB  - Bacteremia strains may influence the clinical therapy, the isolation of bacteremia strains is important for patients. In order to understand the distribution and the growth in the blood culture media of bacteremia strains, from January 1982 through December 1988 we studied the blood culture sent to us from the pediatric ward. These were three hundred and forty one bacterial strains (3.1%) isolated from patients. In the meantime we also studied the bacteremia strains growth in the blood culture media. In these positive cultures, there were 83 gram-positive, and 258 gram-negative strains. The 83 gram-positive included Staphylococcus aureus (38 strains), hemolytic streptococcus (22 strains), Enterococcus (13 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8 strains) and others (2 strains). The 258 gram-negative strains included Escherichia coli (97 strains), Salmonella spp. (43 strains), Enterobacter spp. (31 strains). Klebsiella spp. (23 strains), Pseudomonas spp. (25 strains), Proteus spp. (17 strains), Citrobacter spp. (11 strains) and others (11 strains). The Growth of bacteremia strains in the blood culture medium, showed that first day isolation strains were 33.7%, second day strains 24.9%, third day were 19.9%, fourth day were 13.5%, fifth day were 3.2%, sixth day were 4.1% and seventh day were 0.6%. In conclusion, the bacteremia strains showed that the gram-negative, which were 75.7%, were more prevalent than the gram-positive which were 24.3%, the isolation of the strains was more in the first to fourth day and grew by 92%, on the fifth day it grew by 3.2% and on the seventh day by only 0.6%. On the fifth day the baby had recovered and we were able to discontinue antibiotic therapy.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of carbamate-linked dual-action antibacterial Ro 24-4383.
AB  - Ro 24-4383 contains desacetylcefotaxime linked by a carbamate bond at the 3' position to ciprofloxacin. Ro 24-4383 was active against 99% of the 363 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes tested in vitro, while the comparative agents cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin were active against 77 and 97%, respectively. The activities (ED50: mg/kg s.c.) of Ro 24-4383, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin in systemic murine infections were: Escherichia coli 257, 1.4, less than 0.5, less than 0.2; Klebsiella pneumoniae A, 11, 30, 0.7; Enterobacter cloacae 5699, 3.2, 35, less than 0.2; Citrobacter freundii BS16, 3, 41, less than 0.5; Serratia marcescens SM, 35, greater than 100, 1.6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa 5712, 67, 100, 10; P. aeruginosa 8780, 33, 193, 3; Staphylococcus aureus Smith (oxacillin-susceptible), 12, 3.7, 1; S. aureus 753 (oxacillin-resistant), 28, greater than 100, 2; Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301, 10, 15, greater than 50, and S. pyogenes 4, 3.3, 1.6, 54. Ro 24-4383, although inactive against the S.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia following one administration of the agent, was highly active (ED50 = 1.5) when three treatments were given following infection. Ro 24-4383 was active against the K.-pneumoniae-induced pneumonia (ED50 = 37), as well as the meningitis induced by S. pneumoniae (ED50 = 158) or K. pneumoniae (ED50 = 100). The protective effect of Ro 24-4383 was demonstrated when administered 8 h before infection with E. coli (ED50 = 37) and 4 h before infection with S. pyogenes (ED50 = 199).
TI  - Comparison of bacteraemic community-acquired lobar pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae in an intensive care unit.
AB  - In a study of 41 consecutive patients with bacteraemia-associated community-acquired lobar pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae an attempt was made to determine whether distinguishing criteria of disease due to these organisms could be identified according to demographic features and the results of initial clinical and laboratory investigations. Such information would aid in the early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The most significant difference between the two groups of patients was the lower platelet count in the K. pneumoniae group (p less than 0.005). In addition leucopenia (p less than 0.05), higher serum albumin (p less than 0.05), and the male sex (p less than 0.05) featured with an increased frequency in patients with pulmonary infection due to K. pneumoniae. Initial antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients with community-acquired lobar pneumonia and thrombocytopenia, particularly when associated with leucopenia and in male patients, should include agents effective against K. pneumoniae.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefpodoxime against 1834 isolates from domiciliary infections at 20 UK centres.
AB  - A total of 1834 non-copy, general practice or outpatient isolates were collected  by 20 hospital laboratories within the British Isles, and identified and tested for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents available by oral administration at one centre. Against Enterobacteriaceae cefpodoxime was the most active beta-lactam agent tested, the MIC90s being: for Escherichia coli 1.0 mg/l, for Proteus mirabilis 1.0 mg/l, for Citrobacter spp. 2.0 mg/l, and for Enterobacter spp., Serratia spp., Morganella spp. and Klebsiella spp. 16-64 mg/l. Cefpodoxime also showed a certain amount of activity against staphylococci and high activity against streptococci, the MIC90s being for Staphylococcus aureus 2 mg/l, for coagulase negative staphylococci 8 mg/l, for Streptococcus pyogenes 0.015 mg/l, for Str. pneumoniae 0.06 mg/l and for Str. agalactiae 0.5 mg/l.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinically isolated bacterial strains to imipenem/cilastatin sodium].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of imipenem/cilastatin sodium (imipenem) and other beta-lactams against clinically isolated 353 bacterial strains were investigated. The results obtained in this study are summarized as follows: 1. Imipenem (IPM) showed potent antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae. 2. IPM had inferior or equivalent antibacterial activities to beta-lactams against clinically isolated Enterobacteriaceae, that is, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes and Proteus spp. 3. IPM showed potent antibacterial activities against clinically isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter anitratus but not against Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Intravenous ofloxacin in severe infections.
AB  - The efficacy and tolerance of intravenous ofloxacin was studied in 70 patients suffering from soft tissue infections (n = 33), intra-abdominal abscesses (n = 14), septicaemia (n = 12), pneumonia (n = 9) and brucellosis (n = 2). The average daily dose was 6 mg/kg divided into two doses. Pathogens treated included Enterobacter cloacae (n = 14), Escherichia coli (n = 12), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 8) and Streptococcus spp. (n = 5). Most patients had several underlying diseases. Most of the patients had received other antibiotic therapy without success. Clinically, 41% were considered cured, 19% improved and 30% failed to respond. Bacteriologically, pathogens were eradicated in 52.5% and persisted in 22.5%. Adverse reactions included an anaphylactoid reaction, abnormal liver function (n = 13) and insomnia (n = 2). This study suggests that higher doses of ofloxacin may be needed in deep seated infections.
TI  - Efficacy of intravenous ofloxacin: a French multicentre trial in 185 patients.
AB  - The efficacy of intravenous ofloxacin therapy (200 mg 12-hourly) followed, when appropriate, by oral administration of the same dose was evaluated in an open multicentre trial involving 185 patients in 31 French hospitals. Dosage adjustment was made for patients in renal failure. Infection was hospital-acquired in 35 cases, 53 patients required admission to an intensive care unit. The infections comprised septicaemia (n = 56), pneumonia (n = 18), bronchitis (n = 10), urinary tract (n = 78), female pelvis (n = 8), bone and joint (n = 5), skin and soft tissues (n = 10). The causative pathogens were: Staphylococcus spp. (n = 23), Streptococcus spp. (n = 11), Escherichia coli (n = 85), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 9), Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Serratia spp. (n = 21), Salmonella spp. (n = 22), Chlamydia spp. (n = 3), Legionella spp. (n = 1), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 1) and miscellaneous Gram-negative bacilli (n = 17). All were ofloxacin-susceptible. Mean duration of therapy was 8.06 ( +/- 2.6) days for the i.v. and 14.8 ( +/- 14.39) days for the oral preparation. Clinical cure was achieved in 173 patients (93.5%). It is concluded that iv ofloxacin is an effective treatment for a range of infections due to susceptible organisms.
TI  - Severe infections treated with intravenous ofloxacin: a prospective clinical multicentre Swiss study.
AB  - In this open prospective clinical trial of iv ofloxacin, 87 patients were treated for severe bacterial infections. Overall results showed a clinical cure rate of 75% and 79/87 87 patients improved. 86% of causative organisms (all sensitive to ofloxacin) were eliminated. The best results were obtained in urinary tract infections where all 30 patients were clinically cured and 27 organisms (Escherichia coli, group D streptococcus, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae) were eliminated. Rapid clinical cure was observed in five patients with prostatitis. Good results were seen in arthritis and osteomyelitis. Less than three days of parenteral therapy were required before improvement was seen in patients presenting with severe enterocolitis. Ofloxacin treatment was used for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 35 patients. Clinical improvement was noted in 28 patients. Five patients had unsatisfactory responses, mainly due to underlying diseases. There were two failures, both in pneumococcal pneumonia. Three minor side effects were recorded. Ofloxacin can be given for severe bacterial infections due to Enterobacteriaceae, other Gram-negative rods and other sensitive organisms. It can be given in penicillin allergic patients but it should not be used in pneumococcal pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro activity of HRE 664, a penem antibiotic.
AB  - HRE 664, a new penem antibiotic, inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella, Shigella, Providencia, Aeromonas, and Morganella at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml but was considerably less active than cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and imipenem. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml). HRE 664 inhibited Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens at 1-8 micrograms/ml, two- to fourfold higher MICs than imipenem. HRE 664 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, but methicillin-resistant S. aureus and S. epidermidis were resistant. Group A, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.06 micrograms/ml. Bacteroides and Clostridium species were inhibited by 0.25 micrograms/ml comparable to imipenem. HRE 664 was not hydrolyzed by beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, PSE-1, PSE-4, OXA-2, OXA-3, K-1, P99, Morganella, P. vulgaris, and S. aureus PC-1 but was hydrolyzed by the beta-lactamase of Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In-vitro activity of cefodizime against respiratory pathogens.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime was studied against respiratory pathogens and was compared with the activity of other beta-lactams, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. Cefodizime displayed high activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.008 mg/l), Branhamella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90 0.5 mg/l). Klebsiella spp. were less susceptible (MIC90 2 mg/l). It was concluded that cefodizime should be a useful agent in the therapy of respiratory tract infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) against clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and fleroxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, greater than 90% of which were isolated from blood culture specimens of cancer patients. Sparfloxacin was extremely active against Acinetobacter species, Aeromonas hydrophila, Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens (inhibiting greater than 90% of these isolates at a concentration of 0.5 microgram/ml) and moderately active against Pseudomonas species, other Proteus species, and Citrobacter freundii. Sparfloxacin inhibited greater than 90% of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant and coagulase-negative strains) at a concentration of 0.12 microgram/ml and greater than 90% of streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) at a concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml. It was also active against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus species, and Corynebacterium jeikeium, organisms that have become fairly common in cancer patients.
TI  - [Studies of polymicrobial infection on pneumonia by transtracheal aspiration in the elderly].
AB  - We studied the polymicrobial infection by transtracheal aspiration (TTA) on pneumonia in the elderly. Incidence of mixed isolation of organisms from TTA was 35% or 39 out of 111 episodes. The principal organisms in polymicrobial infection detected from TTA were S. aureus (N.23), P. aeruginosa (N. 15), K. pneumoniae (N. 12) and S. pneumoniae (N. 11). The principal combination of mixed infection were S. aureus + P. aeruginosa (N.7), S. aureus + K. pneumoniae (N.5), S. aureus + S. marcescens (N.5), S. aureus + S. pneumoniae (N.5), S. aureus + Anaerobes (N.4) and K. pneumoniae + P. aeruginosa (N.4). Hospital acquired pneumonia was of a higher rate of mixed infection than the nursing home acquired pneumonia. In the mixed infection on pneumonia in the elderly, normal upper airway flora was highly detected with pathogens from transtracheal aspirates. From these results, we realize that aspiration and superinfection were important factors in mixed infection in the elderly.
TI  - Studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  - Two unique forms of periodontal disease, HIV-gingivitis and HIV-periodontitis, have been described in patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in AIDS patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 AIDS patients with periodontitis. The presence of putative periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides intermedius, Porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly B. gingivalis), and Wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 AIDS patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. Of 666 bacterial strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, Streptococcus sanguis II was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by Lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (12%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), Actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and Actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). Fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. Enteric species including Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium clostridiiforme and Clostridium difficle as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. Immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of A. actinomycetemcomitans, B. intermedius, and P. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four times more periodontitis patients demonstrated W. recta. Subgingival yeast was a frequent finding in these AIDS patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. This study indicates that subgingival plaque in AIDS patients with periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-HIV infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of BMY-28232, parent compound of an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - BMY-28232, an aminothiazolyl imino methoxy cephalosporin which is available as an orally absorbed acetoxyethyl ester, inhibited strains of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and many strains of Proteus and Providencia stuartii at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, including isolates resistant to cephalexin and cefaclor. It had activity similar to that of cefixime, but was more active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci. BMY-28232 was a poor substrate for beta-lactamases but was destroyed by the new TEM-3 enzyme, and had less activity against Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Proteus vulgaris isolates. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Pseudomonas species, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Bacteroides fragilus and some strains of Clostridium species were resistant to BMY-28232.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - We investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. IPM had significantly high activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. In a comparative study on activities of IPM against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, P. mirabilis or A. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among Staphylococcus aureus, CNS, S. marcescens and P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Treatment of community-acquired lower respiratory tract infections with oral cefuroxime axetil.
AB  - The subjects were adult hospitalized patients, 12 with pneumonia and eight with acute bronchitis. The patients with pneumonia received 500 mg of cefuroxime orally twice daily and the patients with bronchitis received 250 mg twice daily. Treatment lasted for ten days in responsive patients. The pathogens identified in the patients' sputum were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, or Branhamella catarrhalis. Clinical and bacteriologic cures were achieved in 11 of the 12 patients with pneumonia and in seven of the eight patients with bronchitis. It is concluded that cefuroxime axetil is safe and effective in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia or acute bronchitis.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimate effective administrative dose of minocyclin. Reevaluation of in vitro MIC break points in disc susceptibility test].
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of minocycline (MINO) against various clinical isolates, 270 strains obtained in 1988, were determined and the reliability of the MINO disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate values of MICs was studied. Clinical significance of a 4 category system for the interpretation of the disc tests, which is widely used in Japan, and that of a 3 category system used in the USA and Europe, were also evaluated to determine which system would be more suitable for the evaluation of proper dose levels of administration. In this study, MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. MIC80 values of MINO against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae were all less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml. Those against Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris were 0.39, 6.25, 3.13, 25, 50 micrograms/ml, respectively. MIC80 values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. were 50, 100, 50 and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. The inhibition zones obtained with the disc method were compared with MICs. The results of MINO disc susceptibility test either with 200 micrograms disc (Showa) or 30 micrograms disc (prepared in this laboratory) were well correlated with MICs, showing the reliability of the disc method in estimating approximate values of MICs. In the 4 category classification system currently used, break points in MIC values proposed are ( ) MIC less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 2-10 micrograms/ml, (+) greater than 10-50 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 50 micrograms/ml. The results obtained with 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs showed false positive in 26.6% and 20.5% of the samples, and false negative in 5.8% and 23.6% of the samples, respectively. The disc results of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, etc. were relatively well classified, but those of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Proteus spp. were not, showing more false positive results. Changing the lower 2 MIC break points in the 4 category system to: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, the false positive results with both 200 micrograms and 30 micrograms discs were reduced to 12% and 6.2%, respectively. The false negative results were 5.8% and 23.6%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (IV). Antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - We determined the MICs of ampicillin, methicillin, cefaclor, cefixime, cefteram,  ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against a total of 1,448 strains from 11 species: 464 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 306 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 114 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 37 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 329 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 66 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 26 strains of Enterobacter cloacae, 20 strains of Serratia marcescens, 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 42 strains of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, isolated from the throat swab and the sputum of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections who visited 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were more active against S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and A. calcoaceticus than other antibiotics. Ampicillin and cefteram were more active against S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes than other antibiotics. New-quinolones and cephems of new-generation were active against H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae and S. marcescens. Of 30 strains of S. aureus which were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin, only one strain was resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) to methicillin. Twenty strains (6.5%) of S. pneumoniae and 49 strains (14.9%) of H. influenzae were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 1.56 micrograms/ml) to ampicillin. Of 101 strains of H. influenzae of which their beta-lactamase activity was determined by Nitrocephin-method, 27 (26.7%) were beta-lactamase-positive strains. The above results indicated that MRSA is only rarely found in primary care clinics but the incidence of ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae in primary care clinics is almost the same as that of the intensive care clinic, i.e. medical school-affiliated hospitals. Therefore caution should be exercised as regards antibiotic resistance of the causative organism even in primary care clinics.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (III). Distribution of  bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in the Tohoku District of Japan].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the throat swab and the sputum respectively of 2,539 patients with respiratory infections visiting 21 private clinics in Tohoku district of Japan during the period from January to April in 1989 was documented. Of the 2,539 patients, 1,694 had an acute upper respiratory infection, 609 had acute bronchitis, 46 had acute pneumonia, 84 had acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory infections and 106 had respiratory infections without diagnosis registered. 1887 (74.3%) strains of potential pathogens were recovered from 1507 (59.4%) of the 2539 cases. The rate of recovery of potential pathogens was very high in patients of the younger age. These patients had elevated body-temperature. There were statistically significant differences in recovery rate when classified by diagnosis, prefecture and the period of investigation. Of the 1,887 strains, 996 (52.8%) were gram-positive and 891 (47.2%) were gram-negative bacteria. The rate of recovery of gram-negative bacteria was high in patients who were less than 10 years old and more than 51 years old, in patients with pneumonia and chronic respiratory infections, and in patients with fever. Of the 1,887 strains, those which exceeded 100 were Staphylococcus aureus (481 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (340 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (329 strains), Streptococcus pyogenes (117 strains) and Acinetobacter spp. (100 strains). Species other than those mentioned above had less than 100 strains. In this group there were 39 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 32 strains of Escherichia coli, 97 strains of Klebsiella spp., 40 strains of Enterobacter spp., 25 strains of Serratia spp., 12 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 43 strains of Pseudomonas putida. There was a remarkable difference in recovery rate of each species when classified by diagnosis, age class, prefecture and the period of investigation, respectively. The above results indicated that gram-positive bacteria are more frequent than gram-negative bacteria, that enterobacteriaceae and glucose-non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are only rarely found in primary care clinics, and that the bacteriology in primary care clinic is different from that of medical school-affiliated hospitals.
TI  - A three year survey of clinical isolates in the United Kingdom and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  - A United Kingdom national survey of clinical isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was performed, with 61 participating hospital laboratories, between 1986 and 1989. Each centre used Microbe Base, a commercial suite of micro-computer programs which can record and analyse antimicrobial susceptibility data Informative on 366,853 bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility was received from hospital and domiciliary specimens; Candida spp. accounted for a further 9121 isolates. The sites of origin were urine 51%, skin and soft tissue 21%, lower respiratory tract 8%, genital tract 7%, ear, nose and throat 6%, eye 3%, blood 1.5% and faeces 1%. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 242,307 isolates, the main species were Escherichia coli 48%, Proteus spp. 9%, Pseudomonas spp. 7%, Haemophilus influenzae 6% and Klebsiella spp. 4%. Gram-positive bacteria numbered 124,546 with a predominance of Staphylococcus aureus 42%, beta-haemolytic streptococci 20%, Enterococcus spp. 12%, coagulase negative staphylococci 10% and Streptococcus pneumoniae 5%. All pneumococci were sensitive to penicillin, and methicillin resistant in Staph. aureus was only 2%. Twelve per cent of H. influenzae strains were resistant to ampicillin. There were no significant levels of gentamicin resistance in Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  - Despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. Thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. We have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. Of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Enterobacter sp (1). Seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees C), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/L [greater than 18,000 cells/microL]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (Enterobacter [3], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and Staphylococcus [2]). Two other donors with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of Pseudomonas septicemia. Late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. Only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. Use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group of recipients. This practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of parenteral 3'-quaternary ammonium cephalosporins.
AB  - The preparation and biological evaluation of a series of 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2(Z)-methoximinoacetamido]cep halosporins, substituted at the 3'-position with monocyclic or bicyclic nitrogen-containing heterocycles are described. The resulting family of parenteral compounds displays a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. Some compounds exhibit a similar level of Gram-negative activity to that of the "third-generation" cephalosporins with increased staphylococcal activity. The in vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity, structure-activity relationships, beta-lactamase stability, and in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evaluations are presented.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of six new oral cephem antibiotics.
AB  - Six newly developed oral cephem antibiotics, which included 5 with an aminothiazolyl side chain, viz., cefixime, cefotiam hexetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, cefteram pivoxil, ceftibuten, and one with a conventional side chain design, BMY 28100, were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Three traditional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, were used as reference antibiotics. The 5 aminothiazolyl cephems were more active than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. All 6 new drugs showed poor activity against clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterococci. They were better than cephalexin and cefaclor, but slightly poorer than or the same as ampicillin in activities against Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefotiam hexetil, BMY 28100, and cefpodoxime proxetil were also more active than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus. Although the 6 tested new oral cephems demonstrated little difference in their activities against different bacteria, they all showed greater antimicrobial activity than the traditional oral antibiotics now in clinical use.
TI  - Quantitative study of wound infection in irradiated mice.
AB  - Bacterial infection of simple wounds was studied directly and quantitatively in adult mice given 6.5 Gy 60Co. Three days later, when neutropenia was evident, the skin and the medial gluteus muscle of anaesthetized mice were incised. A suspension of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes was inoculated into the wound. Bacteria per mg muscle were enumerated 3, 4 or 7 days later. The geometric means of bacteria per mg were greater in irradiated than in non-irradiated mice. Phagocytic cells were present in the wounded tissue. Hence sublethal ionizing radiation enhanced the susceptibility of mice to infections of wounds by these four bacterial species.
TI  - Comparison of norfloxacin versus nalidixic acid in therapy of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - Thirty-seven adult patients with acute urinary tract infections (UTI) were randomized to receive either a seven day (lower UTI) or a 14 day (upper UTI) course of norfloxacin 400 mg orally twice daily, or nalidixic acid 1 g orally four times per day. Mean age, underlying disease and infecting organisms were similar in the two groups. Nine patients in the norfloxacin group and seven in the nalidixic acid group had presumptive evidence of upper UTI. Overall, 12 patients had antibody-coated bacteria-positive infections. The infecting organisms were: Escherichia coli (27), coagulase-negative staphylococci (four), Citrobacter freundii (three), Klebsiella pneumoniae (three), and Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter agglomerans, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis (one of each). All of the organisms were susceptible to norfloxacin, while 81% were susceptible to nalidixic acid. The effects on the periurethral and anal canal flora were similar in both groups. Five patients in each group experienced adverse clinical effects. The cure rates for norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were 79 and 83%, respectively. There were two failures, two relapses and four reinfections in the norfloxacin group. In the nalidixic acid group, there were two failures, one relapse and four reinfections. One of the failure patients in the nalidixic acid group developed resistance to the drug, and two of the four reinfections were due to organisms resistant to nalidixic acid. In this patient population it was concluded that nalidixic acid may be as effective as norfloxacin in the treatment of acute, symptomatic UTI.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of naphthoquinones from fusaria.
AB  - Twenty-two naphthoquinone compounds isolated or derived synthetically from culture extracts of Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were examined for antimicrobial activity. Fifteen exhibited antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, and 12 were active against Streptococcus pyogenes, but none were active at the highest rate of 128 micrograms/ml against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Of 8 plant pathogenic bacteria tested against 11 naphthoquinones, Corynebacterium poinsettiae was inhibited by 6 compounds, and Pseudomonas viridiflava was weakly inhibited by one. Only one of a group of 6 fluorescent soil pseudomonads was inhibited by one naphthoquinone. Antifungal activity of 10 compounds against 8 fungal plant pathogens was limited to inhibition of Phytophthora parasitica by one naphthopyran.
TI  - Treatment of respiratory tract infections in children: a study of a combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid.
AB  - In an open study, 70 in-patients and 23 out-patients aged between 1 and 14 years  with sinusitis (n = 1), perforated otitis media (n = 4), pharyngotonsillitis (n = 25), tracheobronchitis (n = 30) or broncho-pneumonia (n = 33) were treated daily with a combination of 40 mg/kg amoxycillin and 10 mg/kg clavulanic acid in three equal doses for between 6 and 15 days. Purulent specimens were cultured when obtainable and pathogenic organisms identified were Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococcal group A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudococcus species and Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, of which 45.7% were beta-lactamase-producing and 54.3% were ampicillin-susceptible. After treatment, only one beta-lactamase-producing Streptococcus and one Staphylococcus infection persisted. Side-effects (vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, maculopapular exanthema, rash) occurred in 16 patients and treatment was withdrawn in eight. It is concluded that the amoxycillin--clavulanic acid combination is a suitable first choice for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in children in whom the pathogenic organism may not have been established.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - [Pulmonary abscesses in material from tuberculosis and lung disease clinics of the Academy of Medicine in Gdansk].
AB  - 47 patients with pulmonary abscesses were analysed. The type of bacteria cultured from the sputum, type of chemotherapy and clinical outcome were assessed. Most of the patients (34) were already treated prior to admission to the Department. Most often with doxycycline and gentamycin. The following organisms were cultured: Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antibiotic therapy was always instituted according to the antibiogram. Most often amikacin and cefamandole was given. The mean duration of hospitalization was 48 days. 44% of the patients were fully cured, in 40% only an improvement was seen. 7 patients expired (16%)--all of these patients were addicted to alcohol or had malignancy.
TI  - Culture-positive thoracic empyema in adults.
AB  - Twenty-nine adult patients with culture-positive thoracic empyema were seen at the University Hospital Kuala Lumpur from 1984 to 1988. Cough, fever, chest pain, dyspnoea and weight loss were the common presenting symptoms. The empyema in 16 patients was associated with primary bronchopulmonary infections, nine occurred following thoracentesis of culture-sterile pleural effusions, two occurred as post-thoracic surgery complications, one following a subdiaphragmatic abscess and one as a result of a stab wound. The most common culture isolates were Streptococcus milleri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Closed tube thoracostomy, the most common form of drainage procedure employed, was able to effect a cure or control of the empyema in 11 out of 19 patients in whom it was used.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - [Clinical examination of ceftibuten in acute bronchitis].
AB  - Clinical evaluation of ceftibuten (CETB, 7432-S) was performed in 20 patients with acute bronchitis. They were consisted of 10 males and 10 females aged from 20 to 80 years old. CETB was given orally in daily dose of 300 mg (18 cases) or 600 mg (2 cases) in three divided portions. The duration of administration was 3 to 14 days. Especially they were given for 7 days in 16 cases. A total of 11 strains comprising 4 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 2 strains of beta-Streptococcus and 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii were identified from sputa before administration. All of the above bacteria were eradicated but, in 1 case, a strain of Streptococcus pyogenes appeared after the treatment (eradication ratio = 100%). The clinical efficacy rate was 100%: Responses were excellent in 3 cases and good in 17 cases. There was no side effect and no abnormal changes in laboratory test results. From the avobe results, it is concluded that CETB is effective, safe and useful new oral cephem on acute bronchitis.
TI  - Therapeutic studies of cefepime (BMY 28142) in murine meningitis and pharmacokinetics in neonatal rats.
AB  - Cefepime (BMY 28142) was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, and moxalactam for efficacy in treating experimental meningitis in mice and neonatal rats. Mice were infected intracranially with Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and treated intramuscularly. Five- to eight-day-old neonatal rats were injected intracisternally with Haemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae and treated intraperitoneally. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against induced meningitis in mice infected with S. agalactiae. Cefepime was as active as cefotaxime against Staphylococcus aureus meningitis, slightly more active than cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and E. coli, and as active as ceftazidime against K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa meningitis. Cefepime was found to be the most active compound against S. pneumoniae and S. agalactiae meningitis in neonatal rats. Against H. influenzae, cefepime was as active as moxalactam and cefotaxime. Ceftazidime was the least active compound. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime in neonatal rats were similar to those of ceftazidime. Both compounds penetrated well into cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissues of uninfected neonatal rats. Relative concentrations were twice as high as those of cefotaxime and moxalactam.
TI  - Microbiology of empyema in children and adolescents.
AB  - The microbiology of empyema was studied in 72 children and adolescents whose specimens yielded bacterial growth after inoculation for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. A total of 93 organisms, 60 aerobic or facultative and 33 anaerobic, were isolated. Aerobic bacteria was isolated in 48 (67%) patients, anaerobic bacteria in 17 (24%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 7 (10%). The predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were Haemophilus influenzae (15 isolates), Streptococcus pneumoniae (13), and Staphylococcus aureus (10). The predominant anaerobes were Bacteroides sp (15 isolates, including 7 Bacteroides fragilis group and 5 Bacteroides melaninogenicus group), anaerobic cocci (9), and Fusobacterium sp (6). beta-lactamase activity was detected in at least one isolate in 20 (37%) of the 54 tested patients. These included all 8 tested S aureus and 7 B fragilis group, 3 of 10 H influenzae, 2 of 4 B melaninogenicus group, and 1 of 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae. Most cases of S pneumoniae and H influenzae were associated with pneumonia. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria was mostly associated with the concomitant diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, subdiaphragmatic abscess, and abscesses of dental or oropharyngeal origin. The data highlight the importance of anaerobic bacteria in selected cases of empyema in children and adolescents.
TI  - Serious pediatric infections.
AB  - Third-generation cephalosporins are important additions to the range of antibiotics available for treating children with serious bacterial infections. They are highly active against the common pathogens, which cause bacterial meningitis in children. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae type b resistant to both ampicillin and chloramphenicol, and Streptococcus pneumoniae relatively resistant to penicillin remain susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, as well as the other more common gram-negative bacilli isolated from neonates and children are susceptible to these agents. However, Listeria monocytogenes is not cephalosporin-sensitive. Ceftazidime is the only third-generation cephalosporin useful for treating serious infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in children. As with other beta-lactam antibiotics, the clearance of cephalosporins is prolonged in neonates, particularly premature babies. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are equivalent to ampicillin and chloramphenicol for the treatment of bacterial meningitis in children over two to three months of age with respect to neurologic outcome and safety, despite the in vitro activity of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone being much greater than the standard antibiotics for the meningeal pathogens. Cefotaxime and ceftriaxone are effective in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections in children. In many instances, ceftriaxone can be administered once daily, which allows for more convenient therapy, particularly on an outpatient basis. Although controversial, ceftazidime has been used as single-agent therapy for empiric treatment of neutropenic immunocompromised children with fever.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a new quinolone, WIN 57273, possessing potent  activity against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of a new 7-dimethylpyridinyl quinolone, WIN 57273, was assessed by using in vitro and in vivo models. Agar inclusion and broth dilution in vitro tests revealed broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms, with the greatest potency observed against the staphylococci. The MIC for 90% of coagulase-positive strains tested (MIC90) was less than or equal to 0.002 micrograms/ml; for the coagulase-negative strains the MIC90 was 0.008 micrograms/ml. Against enterococci the MIC90 was 0.06 micrograms/ml, with comparable activity observed against group A and group B streptococci as well as against the pneumococci. In general, the MIC90s for the gram-negative bacteria were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. Exceptions were Serratia marcescens (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml), Citrobacter freundii (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). The greatest potency was observed against Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria spp., with MIC90s of 0.06 and 0.016 micrograms/ml, respectively. Broad-spectrum activity was also observed against anaerobes, with MIC90s ranging from 0.125 to 0.5 micrograms/ml among the species tested. The in vivo efficacy was determined by using a murine model by calculating the 50% protective doses against a lethal bacterial infection caused by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The staphylocci were most susceptible, with 50% protective doses for all strains ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 mg/kg. With the exception of the Pseudomonas infection, which was refractory to treatment, animals that were part of the other infection models responded to less than 10 mg/kg. Equivalent activity was seen with the subcutaneous or the oral route of drug administration. WIN 57273 was significantly more potent than ciprofloxacin in treating gram-positive bacterial infections (2- to 20-fold) but was significantly less effective at treating gram-negative bacterial infections (30- to 300-fold).
TI  - The antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria isolated from the blood of patients in St  Thomas' Hospital, 1969-1988.
AB  - We have monitored the antibiotic sensitivity of bloodstream isolates of common bacteria over a period of 20 years. Among the Gram-positive bacteria, the proportion of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, erythromycin, fusidate, or gentamicin has increased marginally, while that of coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly Staph. epidermidis) has increased markedly. Enterococci are becoming serially more resistant to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. The Enterobacteriaceae have become considerably less sensitive to ampicillin (and amoxycillin) and trimethoprim but more sensitive to the aminoglycosides, whilst their susceptibility to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, imipenem, meropenem and temocillin has remained constant. We have some evidence that in-vitro resistance is clinically relevant since the mortality rate rises if inappropriate antibiotics are used empirically. Although many drug regimens could be used, we are able to recommend initial therapy with a combination of gentamicin and cefuroxime for most of our patients, the exceptions being those known to be infected with resistant organisms before the onset of septicaemia.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of the penem FCE 22101 against selected gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in vitro and in vivo by the use of a tissue cage model in rabbits.
AB  - Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for their bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect (PAE) with the new penem FCE 22101. The tissue cage model in rabbits was used to study PAE in vivo. The bactericidal activity against all four species was shown to be in the range of 0.05-4.0 mg/l. A 99.9% killing effect at MBC concentrations was reached within 2 hours with S. pneumoniae and K. pneumoniae and within 6-8 hours with S. aureus and H. influenzae. After in vitro exposure by FCE 22101 a PAE in vitro and in vivo was obtained against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae strains but no PAE could be demonstrated against K. pneumoniae. FCE 22101 showed a good bactericidal activity and PAE against the strains investigated, except for K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of Dycal and visible-light-cured Dycal (Prisma VLC Dycal).
AB  
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Norfloxacin use in urinary tract infection by urologists and infectious disease specialists.
AB  - One hundred thirty-one patients of urologists and infectious disease specialists  were entered into an open trial of norfloxacin in the therapy of urinary tract infections (UTIs). All patients were evaluable for tolerability and 98 were evaluable for efficacy. The patient population in this study was older (mean age 53 years) and had more underlying urogenital disorders (30%) or recent invasive urologic procedures (20%) than the typical patient population with UTIs. Over 50% of the patients had infections due to organisms other than Escherichia coli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5), Enterobacter spp (3) and Group D streptococcus (6). Clinical and bacteriologic cure rates were 90 and 91%, respectively. Side effects occurred in 5 patients and were generally mild.
TI  - [Evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the treatment of respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) was administered to 55 patients with respiratory tract infections (RTI). A clinical evaluation of IPM/CS was carried out in 51 patients, 28 with pneumonia, 4 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with pyothorax, 6 with bronchitis, 9 with bronchiectasis, 1 with diffuse panbronchiolitis and 2 with RTI with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and the clinical efficacy rate was 78.4%. Causative organisms were isolated in 23 strains out of 20 patients, such as Staphylococcus aureus 4 strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1 strain, Branhamella catarrhalis 1 strain, Haemophilus influenzae 2 strains, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 strains, Pseudomonas sp. 1 strain, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 1 strain, Acinetobacter sp. 1 strain and glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative rod 1 strain. An eradication rate of 70.6% was obtained. An overall eradication rate of main causative organisms in RTI including S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and K. pneumoniae was 75.0%. Clinical adverse effects were observed in 5 patients, and these were eruption in 2, itching in 1, vomiting in 1 and drug fever in 1. Abnormalities in laboratory test results were observed in 8 patients. These disappeared or returned to normal values after completion or discontinuation of IPM/CS administration. IPM/CS appears to be a useful antibiotic for the treatment of RTI, especially severe infections.
TI  - [Studies on respiratory infections in primary care clinic (II). Distribution and  antibiotic sensitivity to 45 agents of bacteria isolated from patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice].
AB  - The bacteriology of the isolates from the sputum or the throat swab of patients with respiratory infections visiting a doctor in private practice in Sendai city during the period from March in 1988 to February in 1989 was documented, and their sensitivity to 45 antimicrobial agents was determined. Of the 568 patients, 514 cases had acute pharyngitis, 8 cases each had acute tonsillitis and acute bronchitis, 7 cases were acute pneumonia, 6 cases had herpangina, 18 cases had hand-foot-mouth disease with the signs of respiratory infections, 5 cases had varicella with the signs of respiratory infections and 2 cases were mumps with the signs of respiratory infections. Three hundred strains of potential (greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml) pathogens were recovered from 293 of the 568 cases, which consisted of 124 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 58 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 45 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 26 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 25 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 9 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 strains of other species, not including non-fermentile gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Staphylococcus aureus and other strains were documented simultaneously in 6 out of 7 cases in which multi-organisms were recovered. Many strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from young patients throughout the year. On the other hand many strains of Branhamella catarrhalis were isolated from elderly patients in winter. The sensitivity of 45 antimicrobial agents of 231 of 300 strains was determined by sensitivity disks (EIKEN, Japan). No strain of the Haemophilus influenzae in this study was resistant to ampicillin. None of the Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes was resistant to ampicillin or cefazolin. None of the Staphylococcus aureus was resistant to cloxacillin, cefazolin, gentamicin or ofloxacin. We conclude from the above results that antibiotic-resistant strains are found presumably only in a very few cases in primary care clinic.
TI  - Bacteria causing respiratory infections in children and their sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  - The author lists the most frequent bacterial agents isolated from the nose and pharynx samples of children that visited the Child Health Centre from 1983 to 1986. The gram-positive bacteria found most often were: Staphylococcus aureus (44% in 1983, 40% in 1986). Streptococcus pneumoniae (6% in 1983, 12% in 1986), and Streptococcus haemolyticus of group "A" (14% in 1983, 19% in 1986). The isolated gram-negative bacteria were: E. coli (14%), Klebsiella enterobacter (8%), and Proteus species and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 to 4% [4, 6, 7, 16]). According to the author's analyses Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to cloxacilline (96%, no changes in the 4-year period), then to sulphametoxasol-trimetropin (95%), to lincomycine (85% no change), while to penicillin it is entirely resistant. Streptococcus pneumoniae proved sensitive to ampicillin, lincocine and erythromycin (96%), to cephalosporins (83%) and to sulphamides (85%). Streptococcus haemolyticus from group "A" reacted to penicillin excellently. The greatest sensitivity to gram-negative bacteria E. coli related to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (96%), chloramphenicol (91%), and to cephalosporines (90%, in 1986 only 60%). Klebsiella enterobacter reacted to aminoglycosides (97%), sulphonamides (92%) and chloramphenicol (83%) and Pseudomonas to aminoglycosides (95%), gentamycin (92%), while to cephalosporines and ampicillin preparations it proved totally resistant.
TI  - [Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis. Report of 3 cases].
AB  - Since the antibiotic era, endophthalmitis has been a rare complication of bacterial septicemia. The authors report hereby 3 cases of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis. Both eyes were involved in one case. Causative bacteria were identified in blood. Cultures were positive respectively for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. All patients received intravenous antibiotherapy, once intravitreal antibiotic was injected. Clinical manifestations were three times panophthalmitis with dramatic course. In one case, only the anterior segment was involved. The course became complicated with a cataract, but the patient finally recovered. Although several clinical types with distinct prognoses can be defined, endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis remains a devastating situation. Treatment is controversial because of the uncertainty about the value of intravitreal antibiotics and vitreous surgery.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of rosin and resin acids in vitro.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of rosins and resin acids were studied in vitro using three methods, disc diffusion on agar, agar dilution, and broth dilution. Rosin and some resin acids had antibacterial effects that were restricted to Gram-positive bacteria. The abietic type of acids had a more pronounced antibacterial activity than the pimaric and labdane acids when the disc diffusion method was used but there was no inhibition of growth of Gram-negative bacteria. Among the individual resin acids, dehydroabietic acid was generally the most potent, when disc diffusion on agar was used, and prediffusion increased the inhibitory effect. The composition of the pure resin acids dehydroabietic, neoabietic, and isopimaric acid did not change during the experiment, but abietic and levopimaric acid were converted into dehydroabietic acid by the addition of Muller-Hinton agar. In conclusion the old tradition of treating wounds with pitch, sap, rosin, or rosin containing tapes might therefore have some antibacterial relevance.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of zinc oxide in vitro.
AB  - Antibacterial activity, zinc concentrations and pH were measured in Muller-Hinton broth containing different amounts of zinc oxide and inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus (10(6) colony forming units/ml). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of zinc oxide to different clinical isolates were determined using the Muller-Hinton agar dilution tests. Gram-positive bacteria were most susceptible. Gram-negative aerobic bacteria and streptococci were usually not inhibited even at the highest concentrations used (1024 micrograms/ml), but staphylococci--particularly some isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis--were sensitive enough to allow determination of their MIC.
TI  - Overview of experience with ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - Ofloxacin is highly active against common respiratory pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis and has clinically applicable activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sputum, lung tissue and bronchial mucosal concentrations of ofloxacin equal or, in most cases significantly exceed the MICs of such pathogens. These in vitro attributes are reflected in the results of the worldwide ofloxacin clinical trial program which achieved overall response rates of 98% in lower respiratory tract infections, 83% in pneumonias and 87% to 95%, in open and comparative studies respectively, in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (CB). Overall bacterial eradication rates ranged from 70% for pneumococci and 84.5% for B. catarrhalis to 88.5% for H. influenzae. In lower respiratory infection ofloxacin gave equal or superior clinical results to amoxycillin or erythromycin therapy together with an overall bacterial eradication rate of 100%. Clinical results comparable with standard agents were also obtained in pneumonia, cure rates ranging from 77-89% at various dosages. Eradication rates proved greatest for H. influenzae (92%) and were satisfactory for Klebsiella spp. (80%), although less so for pneumococci (73%). Bacteriological eradication rates in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis ranged from 68% for pneumococcal infections, to 85% in B. catarrhalis and 94% in H. influenzae infections. Ofloxacin compared favourably with pivampicillin, co-trimoxazole and doxycycline clinically. A daily oral ofloxacin dose of 400 mg produced a good clinical response in 92% of patients or more. The available clinical data therefore substantially confirm the claim of ofloxacin to offer an effective alternative in many forms of acute bacterial respiratory infection, especially where H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis are involved.
TI  - Therapeutic effects of cefpirome, a new cephalosporin, on various models of infections in mice and rats.
AB  - Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin with a 2,3-cyclopentenopyridine group in the 3-position side chain. It was compared with other cephem antibiotics in protective and therapeutic effects on various experimental infections, systemic and local, in mice and rats. HR 810 had more potent protective effect than ceftazidime (CAZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), and cefotaxime (CTX) on systemic infections induced by Escherichia coli Ec-31, Staphylococcus aureus SMITH, and Serratia marcescens Sm-6 in mice. Against systemic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa HR 810 was as effective as CAZ. Mice with leukopenia induced by cyclophosphamide were systemically infected with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Enterococcus faecalis. HR 810 was superior to cefuzonam (CZON) and cefmetazole against MRSA and MSSA and was much more active than any other antibiotics tested against E. cloacae and A. calcoaceticus. In the activity against E. faecalis, HR 810 was inferior to ampicillin but superior to CZON. In mice with pyelonephritis caused by E. coli Ec-7, the rank order of activities was HR 810 greater than CAZ greater than CTX greater than CPZ. HR 810 was more effective than latamoxef, CAZ, CTX, and CPZ in improving lung infections induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae HL 438 and Klebsiella pneumoniae Kp-51 in mice. HR 810 was superior to CTX and CPZ and comparable to cefazolin in therapeutic effects on intrauterine infections with E. coli Ec-89 and S. aureus SMITH in rats.
TI  - Association of bacteria with the fungal fermentation of soybean tempe.
AB  - Bacteria grew to viable populations of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g during the fermentation  of soybeans into tempe with the fungus, Rhizopus oligosporus. Bacillus pumilus and B. brevis were the predominant bacterial species, reaching populations of approximately 10(8) cfu/g during the 48 h fermentation. Species of Streptococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae also contributed to the fermentation and achieved populations of 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g.
TI  - [The advantages of agglutination and precipitation tests used in the serological  diagnosis of meningitis due to H. influenza type B].
AB  - During the period January 1985-July 1988, 532 purulent CSF taken from patients with meningitis, aged between 3 weeks and 91 years, were studied by microscopic examination, cultivation and for H. influenzae type B (HITB) also by coagglutination (COA), counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) and double immunodiffusion (DID) in agarose gel. Positive CSFs were taken from the patients aged 1 month-24 years old, of which 76% from children under 5 years old, and 42% from children under one year. 65.9% of the patients were males; the disease was more frequent in the first and last 4 months of the year, with the highest incidence in April. 12 bacterial spectra were found: N. meningitidis--62.97%, Str. pneumoniae--9.77%, H. influenzae type B--8.27%, and also Salmonella, E. coli, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, Alcaligenes, Proteus and Enterobacter in 4.70; the rest of 14.28% had indefinite etiology. H. influenzae was evidenced in CSF by microscopic examination in 3.38%, by cultivation in 3.94%, and the soluble antigen of HITB by COA in 8.27%, by CIE in 8.08% and by DID in 7.33%. The sensibility order of the tests was: COA, CIE, DID, cultivation and microscopic examination. The COA and CIE techniques are recommended for the current use in examination of the purulent CSF due to their simplicity, rapidity, sensibility, specificity and possibility of establishing the diagnosis when the bacteriologic techniques are negative.
TI  - Relationship of high tissue concentrations of azithromycin to bactericidal activity and efficacy in vivo.
AB  - Measurement of killing kinetics of azithromycin against strains of Streptococcus  pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae in vitro showed that it had a limited bactericidal activity (greater than 90% kill) for the first eight hours of incubation, but developed complete bactericidal activity (greater than 99.9% kill) by 24 h incubation. Since high and sustained tissue levels of azithromycin occur in animals and humans, it was proposed that it might produce a bactericidal effect in vivo. This was demonstrated in a lung infection model in mice, designed to mimic the in-vitro killing studies. A 25 mg/kg dose of azithromycin given 24 h before intranasal challenge reduced the recoverable Str. pneumoniae population by greater than 99.9%, in comparison with untreated controls. Erythromycin did not produce a bactericidal effect at 100 mg/kg, and roxithromycin only reduced the viable count by 96%, at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Against a K. pneumoniae lung infection, a 50 mg/kg dose of azithromycin reduced the bacterial count by 99%. The bactericidal effect was correlated with lung tissue concentrations of azithromycin. In a proliferating Escherichia coli paper disc infection model, extravascular fluid concentrations of azithromycin were correlated with a 99.9% reduction in bacterial count, while corresponding serum concentrations were always less than the MIC. Dosing with azithromycin eradicated Haemophilus influenzae from the bulla (middle ear) of gerbils, as was not the case with erythromycin and roxithromycin. This effect was correlated with the antibiotic concentration in bulla lavage.
TI  - Radio-immunoassay for formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine. I. Development and application to assessment of chemotactic peptide production by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial chemotactic peptides are low molecular weight peptides which stimulate  a wide range of neutrophil functions following binding to specific leucocyte receptors. Formyl methionyl leucyl phenylalanine (FMLP) is the major chemotactic peptide in Escherichia coli culture supernatants. This paper reports the development and validation of a radio-immunoassay (RIA) for FMLP and its application to the analysis of formyl peptide production by enteric bacteria in vitro. The assay was moderately sensitive (10 nmol/L FMLP) and highly specific showing cross reactivity with F-met-leu-tyr, F-nle-leu-phe and F-met-met-met sequences (ID50 = 200, 100 and 250 nmol/L, respectively) but no significant cross reactivity with non-formylated or other formylated di- and tri-peptides (ID50 = 10(5) nmol/L. Culture supernatants from five species of enteric bacteria were filtered, concentrated and fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography before RIA. All five organisms produced immunoreactive F-met peptides. A major peak of immunoreactivity co-chromatographing with authentic FMLP was found in all supernatants, but additional peaks representing more hydrophobic peptides were found in Streptococcus faecalis and Bacteroides fragilis cultures. In E. coli culture supernatants, concentration of immunoreactive FMLP increased in a linear fashion during 3 h of log phase growth reaching 31.2 nmol/L(s.e.m. = 10) with final bacterial concentrations of 3 +/- 0.73 x 10(8)/mL (n = 6). These findings extend earlier work showing production of bioactive formyl oligopeptides by different species of enteric bacteria and suggest that a RIA for FMLP will be a useful tool for investigating the production and metabolic fate of such peptides in man.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1987)].
AB  - Since 1981, in cooperation with research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto, et al. have been collecting clinical isolates from patients with respiratory tract infections and conducting an annual retrospective survey of patients' background factors and of isolated strains and their sensitivities to various antibacterial agents and antibiotics. In the period from October, 1987 to September, 1988, 17 institutions participated in the survey and a total of 706 strains which were demonstrated to be causative organisms were isolated from 562 patients with respiratory tract infections. Strains were mostly isolated from the sputum. The taxonomic breakdown of these strains was: Staphylococcus aureus (69 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (120), Haemophilus influenzae (170), Mucoid-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (42), Non-mucoid-producing P. aeruginosa (87), Escherichia coli (11), Klebsiella pneumoniae (35), Brahamella catarrharis (72), etc. Of these strains, 629 were used to determine MICs of various antibacterial agents and antibiotics for susceptibility analyses. Relationships between patient backgrounds and diagnoses and between infections diseases and causative organisms were also investigated. Most of the major causative organisms, such as H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa, showed no substantial changes from previous years, with regard to their sensitivities to antibiotic agent, but S. aureus, particularly methicillin/cephem-resistant strains of S. aureus (MCRSA) showed somewhat lower sensitivity to beta-lactams, and as in recent years, to ofloxacin, a new quinolone drug, as well. Regarding background factors of patients, the age distribution was heavily concentrated in age brackets of 50 years and older, thus patients in these age group accounted for 75.2% of all the patients, which was comparable to 73.5% in 1985 and 77.9% in 1986. Among infections encountered, bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 28.3%, followed by chronic bronchitis (27.2%) and bronchiectasis (16.0%). Bacterial pneumonia was actually the most frequent, throughout the entire age groups accounting for 34.3% of patients up to 29 years, 26.6% in the group of 30-69 years and 30.7% in patients aged 70 years and older. Chronic bronchitis was next most frequent and accounted for 20.0%, 26.4% and 30.7% among the three age groups, respectively. Breaking down clinical isolates by diagnosis, H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated frequently from most of the infectious diseases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vivo evaluation of a dual-action antibacterial, Ro 23-9424, compared to cefotaxime and fleroxacin.
AB  - The dual-action antibacterial R 23-9424 (desacetylcefotaxime linked to the quinolone fleroxacin) is a new antibacterial agent with excellent in vitro activity. It was evaluated for in vivo efficacy in comparison with the cephalosporin cefotaxime and the quinolone component, fleroxacin. Ro 23-9424 demonstrated significant activity against all strains tested in systemic infections, including those strains resistant in vivo to cefotaxime (Staphylococcus aureus 753, Serratia marcescens SM and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8780) and fleroxacin (Streptococcus pneumoniae 6301 and Streptococcus pyogenes. In prophylactic studies, Ro 23-9424 compared favorably with fleroxacin against Escherichia coli and with cefotaxime against S. pyogenes, but Ro 23-9424 was considerably more active than cefotaxime against E. coli and more active than fleroxacin against S. pyogenes. In a murine pneumonia model, Ro 23-9424 was equivalent in activity to cefotaxime against S. pneumoniae and more active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae. Fleroxacin was inactive against S. pneumoniae and about 20-fold more active than Ro 23-9424 against K. pneumoniae. In a murine meningitis infection caused by S. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was 3 times as active as cefotaxime, while fleroxacin was inactive. When meningitis was induced by K. pneumoniae, Ro 23-9424 was as active as the quinolone, while cefotaxime was inactive. In a neutropenic (immunocompromised) model, Ro 23-9424 was more active than cefotaxime against P. aeruginosa and 5-fold less active than fleroxacin. In the control normal (immunocompetent) mouse infection, Ro 23-9424 was 3-fold more active than cefotaxime, but 10-fold less active than fleroxacin.
TI  - [Sepsis at an internal medicine department].
AB  - 185 cases of bacteremia admitted at the internal medicine department of "C.S. Virgen de la Arrixaga" in Murcia from 1977 to 1986, were studied retrospectively. The common infection was significantly associated to Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus A group and Neisseria meningitidis and the nosocomial infection was associated to Klebsiella Pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescens y Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter. We did not find significant differences between the common and nosocomial infection caused by E. Coli and Proteus mirabilis. These factors were associated to an increase of mortality: age greater than 40 years, nosocomial infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other associated rapidly lethal diseases, acute clinical state at the beginning of bacteremia, shock and non-correct antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Bacterial agents associated with bronchopulmonary disorders in eastern Nigeria.
AB  - Altogether 16,539 sputum specimens were examined microbiologically from 1980 to 1984. Out of these 12,588 were screened by Ziehl-Neelsen's staining technique and 782 were (6.3%) found AFB-positive. Age and sex distributions of the AFB-positive individuals were statistically significant (at 0.05), incidence being most prevalent among those 20 years and above (90.2%) and among males (61.2%). From other specimens cultured, non-AFB organisms were isolated at the following frequencies: coliform-like organisms (15.1%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae (5.3%), Streptococcus pyogenes (3.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.4%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.0%). Proteus Spp. (0.7%) and Escherichia coli (0.5%). The antibiogram of these isolates revealed a high incidence of multiple antibiotic resistance, a situation that has most probably arisen from the high degree of antibiotic misuse in Nigeria.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the imipenem/cilastatin combination in the therapy of severe infections in patients with malignant diseases.
AB  - Thirty hospitalized patients (23 men and 7 women), aged 42 to 78 years, with impaired host defences for malignant underlying diseases and affected by life-threatening infections, were treated with the imipenem/cilastatin combination at a dosage ranging between 2 and 4 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 9.6 +/- 2.09 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Pseudomonas aeruginosa [12], Escherichia coli [10], Klebsiella pneumoniae [5], Proteus mirabilis [3], P. vulgaris [2], Serratia marcescens [1], Staphylococcus aureus [3], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Bacteroides fragilis [5]. In fourteen patients a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-three patients (76.66%) were completely cured of infection and 35 out of 44 isolated organisms (79.54%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Sandwich enzyme immunoassays for detection of Salmonella typhi.
AB  - Enzyme immunoassays were developed using monoclonal antibodies raised against somatic (O), flagellar (H) and capsular (Vi) antigens of Salmonella typhi. The assay based on anti-O monoclonal antibodies could specifically detect S. typhi and soluble lipopolysaccharide (LPS) isolated from S. typhi. Anti-H MoAbs detected motile S. typhi and soluble flagellar antigen. Monoclonal antibodies against capsular polysaccharide could detect Vi-containing S. typhi as well as soluble Vi antigen. The three assays reported here detected S. typhi with 100% sensitivity in blood culture broths obtained from bacteriologically confirmed typhoid patients and were negative with blood specimens containing Salmonella senftenberg, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis or Streptococcus (alpha-hemolytic) derived from patients with pyrexia. The assays, however, did not demonstrate the presence of soluble antigens in sera and urine samples obtained from typhoid patients.
TI  - Randomized, double-blind comparative study of intravenous ciprofloxacin versus ceftazidime in the treatment of serious infections.
AB  - We compared intravenously administered ciprofloxacin with ceftazidime in a randomized, double-blind study. Patients received ciprofloxacin 200 mg intravenously every 12 hours or ceftazidime 2 g intravenously every eight hours, with placebo infusions to maintain blinding. Therapy with metronidazole was added for suspected or documented intra-abdominal infection. Thirty-two of the 57 ciprofloxacin-treated patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 34 sites. Thirty-six of the 56 ceftazidime patients were evaluable for determination of efficacy and had 41 bacterial isolates from 38 sites. Seven of 35 bacteremic patients had no identifiable primary focus. The most commonly isolated pathogens were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Cure rates and bacteriologic eradication rates were comparable. Nine patients did not improve. Patients with treatment failures in the ciprofloxacin group included a quadriplegic patient with relapse of urinary tract infection with bacteremia (K. pneumoniae). Another patient with bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), pneumonia (Proteus vulgaris), and urinary tract infection (P. vulgaris, Providencia sp.) died on the first treatment day. The third patient (S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia) had a new aspiration pneumonia develop on the third day; the pneumococcus also persisted. Undrained S. pneumoniae empyema caused the fourth ciprofloxacin treatment failure, and the fifth patient had a relapse of S. aureus pneumonia with bacteremia. One ceftazidime-treated patient died of pneumococcal pneumonia on the first day. Another had persistent Staphylococcus epidermidis and Listeria bacteremia despite 48 hours of treatment. Two other patients had pneumonia (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively) and completed full courses of ceftazidime therapy without improvement. Five patients had pneumococcal bacteremia; four patients were cured: one of two patients in the ciprofloxacin group and three of three patients in the ceftazidime group. Significant increases in the number of platelets (four patients with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) and declines in the number of platelets (one patient with ciprofloxacin treatment, one patient with ceftazidime treatment) were observed. Intravenously administered ciprofloxacin is comparable with ceftazidime and is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of patients with serious infections, including bacteremia.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination. Treatment of bacterial infections in hospitalized children.
AB  - Eighteen patients 2 months to 11 years of age with culture proven bacterial infections were treated with parenteral ticarcillin/clavulanic acid in a noncomparative study. Seven patients had pneumonia, two had tracheobronchitis, three had soft tissue abscess, two had periorbital cellulitis, three had urinary tract infection and one had purulent bursitis. Four of the 18 were bacteremic. Organisms treated included Staphylococcus aureus (6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Branhamella catarrhalis (2), Escherichia coli (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1) and Serratia marcescens (1). Thirteen of 15 (87%) organisms tested were beta-lactamase positive. Therapy was given intravenously in six doses per day at 310 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 5 to 28 (mean 11) days, with an average time of 4 days to clinical improvement. Seventeen patients (94%) were clinically cured. One patient with recurrent aspiration pneumonia due to mixed infection with multiple gram-negative enteric bacilli failed therapy. Adverse effects were minimal and transient. Notably, mild to moderate thrombocytosis occurred in four (22%) patients that resolved uneventfully. We conclude that ticarcillin/clavulanic acid is safe and effective therapy for serious infections in hospitalized children.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1986)].
AB  - Enlisting the help of various research institutions across the nation, Ikemoto et al. have been pooling cultures of clinical isolates of respiratory tract infections and mapping out the correlations between patient backgrounds and the causative bacteria and the changes in the sensitivity spectra of the bacteria to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents annually since 1981. The following is a report of the 1986 findings. During the period from September, 1986 to March, 1987, 558 cases of respiratory infections were reported at 17 institutions across the nation and a total of 657 apparent causative strains were isolated from sputum samples. Of these strains, 75 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 108 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 150 of Haemophilus influenzae, 107 of Pseudomonas aeruiginosa (non-mucoid production type), 21 of P. aeruginosa (mucoid production type), 32 of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 of Escherichia coli, and 55 of Branhamella catarrhalis were subjected to MIC determination of various antibacterial and antibiotic agents to map drug sensitivities. In addition, diagnoses, age distributions by diagnoses, frequencies of infectious diseases, types of isolated bacteria, and usage statuses of the antibacterial and antibiotic agents the times of at isolation were also investigated. MIC determinations were carried out to investigate susceptibilities of causative organisms of respiratory tract infections to various antibacterial and antibiotic agents. From the 558 cases of respiratory tract infections, 657 strains were detected at concentrations not less than 10(4-6)/ml and identified to be the causative organisms. Of these strains, 603 could be used for MIC determination. An overwhelming majority of major causative bacteria, inclusive of H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae, showed sensitivity patterns similar to the sensitivity patterns found a year earlier, P. aeruginosa alone, however, showed some increase in its susceptibility to penicillin and cephem antibiotics. Regarding patient backgrounds, the age distribution was heavily biased towards the higher end of the scale, which patients with ages of 50 or higher accounting for 77.9%, compared to 73.5% in 1985. When the patients were classified by diagnoses, chronic bronchitis, bacterial pneumonia and bronchiectasis accounted for the majority of the infections: 28.7%, 23.3%, and 19.0%, respectively. The percentages of chronic bronchitis and bacterial pneumonia 28.7% and 23.3%, respectively, were somewhat higher in 1986 than in 1985. The disease which was comparatively frequent in all age groups was bronchiectasis, which accounted for 44.0% in patients with ages 29 years or lower, 18.4% in patients between 30 years and 69 years, and 16.7% in patients with ages 70 years or higher. The next most frequent infection was bacterial pneumonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Study on cefotaxime in respiratory surgery: transfer to lung tissue and kinetics in serum].
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX) was intravenously administered in a dose of 1 g to patients just prior to lung surgery. Lung tissue specimens were collected at 1, 2 and 3 hours after the CTX administration, and the concentration of CTX in each specimen was determined. At the same time, the concentration of CTX in the serum was also measured. The results are summarized below. 1. Determination of the CTX concentration in the lung tissue using bioassay showed values of 3.78 +/- 1.93 micrograms/g at 1 hour after CTX administration, 1.91 +/- 0.92 microgram/g at 2 hours, and 1.19 +/- 1.04 micrograms/g at 3 hours. 2. Determination of the CTX concentration in the serum using bioassay showed values of 36.9 +/- 14.4 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes after CTX administration, 22.5 +/- 10.5 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 12.8 +/- 6.32 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 8.52 +/- 5.54 micrograms/ml at 3 hours, and 3.98 +/- 3.19 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The serum half-life was calculated to be 1.82 hours. 3. The CTX concentration of 3.78 +/- 1.93 micrograms/g in the lung tissue at 1 hour after CTX administration was more than 10 times higher than the MIC80 values for Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC80 less than or equal to 0.025 microgram/ml) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (0.05 micrograms/ml), 2 of the principal causative organisms of respiratory tract infections. The pattern of change in concentrations of CTX in the serum of these surgical patients was concluded to be similar to the pattern in healthy adult subjects. On the basis of the results summarized above, it appears that CTX is a useful antimicrobial agent for application in the field of respiratory surgery.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach to estimating the effective administration dose of  imipenem/cilastatin. Evaluation of the disk susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of imipenem/cilastatin (IPM/CS) against 413 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MICs and the results of disk susceptibility tests. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. The MIC80s of imipenem (IPM) against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis were 25 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively, showing a bimodal MIC distribution. However, the distribution of MICs against other bacteria studied was of monomodal pattern. Group A Streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by IPM at dose levels less than 0.025 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. IPM inhibited Escherichia coli at 0.20 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae at 0.39 microgram/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one strain showed a MIC of 25 micrograms/ml, Serratia spp. at 3.13 micrograms/ml except one with MIC greater than 100 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii at 0.78 microgram/ml and Enterobacter spp. at 0.39 microgram/ml. Indole (-) Proteus and indole (+) Proteus were inhibited by this drug at levels of 3.13 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively. The reliability of the IPM disk diffusion susceptibility test in quantitative estimation of antimicrobial activities was well demonstrated using commercialized 8 mm diameter Showa disks containing 30 micrograms antibiotic and also disks containing 1-30 micrograms prepared in this laboratory. For the interpretation of the Showa disk susceptibility test, a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa IPM disk the following classification of inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed; ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disk against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups, showing false positive 8 out of 304 strains (2.6%) and false negative 1 of 304 strains (0.3%). With Showa 30 micrograms disks subclassification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, the differentiation of strains with MICs less than 1 microgram/ml was made with disks containing 5-10 micrograms, which afforded to set MIC break points at 1 and 3 micrograms/ml. According to current concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including the penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except in the hepato-biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy of clavulanate-potentiated antibiotics against Bacteroides species and artificially associated cultures of aerobes and anaerobes.
AB  - Clavulanic acid is known to potentiate the activity of amoxycillin and ticarcillin against beta-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species. In order to assess the usefulness of the clavulanate antibiotics in mixed infections with aerobes and anaerobes, artificially associated cultures of clinically significant Bacteroides species and facultative anaerobes (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp.) were tested. The minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of amoxycillin and ticarcillin, singly and in combination with clavulanate, were determined for the individual species in the associated culture and for the associated culture as a whole. In the absence of clavulanate, association experiments showed that the MBCs of susceptible strains increased in the presence of beta-lactamase-producing species, whereas the addition of clavulanate to the test systems led to MBCs which were mostly comparable to values as determined in single strain testing.
TI  - Purification, composition, and activity of two bactenecins, antibacterial peptides of bovine neutrophils.
AB  - Extracts of granules of bovine neutrophils are known to exhibit a marked antibacterial activity in vitro. By a simple, two-step chromatographic procedure, we have resolved two peptide components of the antibacterial system. They were named Bac-5 and Bac-7 from the general term bactenecin and had molecular masses of about 5 and 7 kilodaltons, respectively. Over 45 and 20% of the amino acid residues in the two bactenecins are proline and arginine, respectively. The remaining amino acids are mainly hydrophobic (isoleucine, leucine, and phenylalanine). Both Bac-5 and Bac-7 efficiently kill Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. They also arrest the growth of Enterobacter cloacae (MICs, 25 to 200 micrograms/ml) but not of Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC, greater than 200 micrograms/ml). Finally, Bac-7 but not Bac-5 has MICs of less than or equal to 200 micrograms/ml for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermidis. From the comparison between the efficient bactericidal concentrations in vitro and the estimated content of bactenecins in neutrophils (125 ng of Bac-5 and Bac-7 each per 10(6) cells), it is reasonable to conclude that the two cationic peptides may exert a major role in host defense against at least some microorganisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FK482, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is an oral aminothiazolyl hydroxyimino cephalosporin with a C-3 vinyl group. Its activity was compared with those of cephalexin, cefuroxime, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. FK482 inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates at 1 micrograms/ml and 90% of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates at less than or equal to 0.012 micrograms/ml, superior to cephalexin and cefuroxime and similar to cefixime. It did not inhibit oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. FK482 inhibited 90% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates at 8 micrograms/ml. Although 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, and Shigella species isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, FK482 was less active than cefixime against Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella, Serratia, and Providencia species, with MICs for many isolates of greater than 8 micrograms/ml. FK482 inhibited Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations comparable to that of cefixime and superior to those of cephalexin and cfaclor. Bacteroides and Pseudomonas species were resistant. FK482 was not hydrolyzed by the TEM-1 and TEM-2 beta-lactamases but was hydrolyzed by TEM-3 and the Proteus vulgaris enzyme. It had a high affinity for chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Hygienic status of food handlers.
AB  - The study demonstrated bacterial species on hands and nails of food-handlers before and after hand-washing. Those were Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Micrococcus spp., Bacillus spp., Diphtheroid, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas spp., Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Citrobacter freundii. Before hand washing, each food-handler harboured one to eight bacterial species. After hand-washing (eight with water from plastic boxes, 97 from pipe water, 57 out of 97 (58.8%) used soap or detergent with water), disappearance of one to four bacterial strains from hands and nails were found in 47.6 per cent of food-handlers. Cultures of water used for washing from eight plastic boxes yielded Staph. spp., Strep. spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Kleb.pneumoniae, Acinetobacter anitratus, Enterobacter cloacae. From pipe water, Diphtheroid in 4, 4.1 per cent Micrococcus in 1, 1.03 per cent were shown. Comparing bacterial species found in food-handlers with long nails and short nails, 4-8 more species were revealed in the former than the latter for 35.7 per cent. After hand-washing, there was recontamination of bacterial species in 17 food-handlers. This was probably due to dirty napkins or dresses during hand-drying or from water in plastic boxes.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.

TI  - [Clinical studies on cefteram pivoxil granules in pediatrics].
AB  - A newly developed cephalosporin, cefteram pivoxil (CFTM-PI, T-2588), was evaluated clinically in 40 patients. A pharmacokinetic study was also performed with 8 patients. CFTM-PI was administered as granules. One patient was given CFTM-PI at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, each of 3 patients was given the drug at a dose of 3 mg/kg and each of 4 patients at a dose of 6 mg/kg. In most cases, serum concentrations of CFTM were determined at 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours after dosing. Urinary concentrations of CFTM were measured for urinary samples collected during periods of 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 and 6-8 hours after dosing. CFTM was assayed using the disk or the cup method using Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031 as the test organism. The clinical evaluation was conducted in 40 children including 13 patients of acute tonsillitis, 10 of acute lacunar tonsillitis, 10 of scarlet fever, 2 of acute bronchitis, 2 of pneumonia, and 1 each of pneumonia with enteritis, phlegmon and urinary tract infection. The patients were from 4 months to 13 years old. Daily doses were from 8.7 to 12 mg/kg. After CFTM-PI administration in doses 1.5 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, peak serum concentrations of CFTM were 0.38 microgram/ml, 0.73-2.25 micrograms/ml and 1.2-2.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, and half-lives were 1.55, 0.95-2.30 and 0.80-2.72 hours, respectively. Urinary excretion rates up to 6 or 8 hours after dosing were 10.8-24.7%. Clinical efficacies of CFTM-PI in 40 patients were "excellent" in 27 children, "good" in 12 children and "fair" in 1 with an efficacy rate of 97.5%. Twenty seven strains of causative organisms, including 15 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 of Escherichia coli, 1 of Salmonella 04, 6 of Haemophilus influenzae, 1 of Haemophilus parainfluenzae and 3 of Branhamella catarrhalis, were isolated. After treatment all strains except 1 strain of B. catarrhalis (unchanged), Salmonella 04 (unknown) and 1 strain of H. parainfluenzae (unknown) were eradicated. Side effects observed clinically were only 1 case of diarrhea. Eosinophilia was observed in 1 case.
TI  - Treatment of childhood bacterial meningitis.
AB  - One hundred and eighty-seven children with identified bacterial meningitis were treated with intravenous cefotaxime: 15 patients were neonates, 79 infants, and 93 were aged from 1 to 14 years. Causative organisms were: Neisseria meningitidis in 80 cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 41, Haemophilus influenzae in 40, enteric gram-negative bacilli in 20 and Staphylococcus spp. in six. Enteric gram-negative bacilli included: Salmonella spp. in 14 cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in two, and Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii and Acinobacter calcoaceticus in one each; in one case the organism was not specified. Daily dose of cefotaxime was 150 to 300 mg/kg. Concomitant treatment with an aminoglycoside was used in seven cases. One hundred and seventy-two patients (92.0%) were cured. Fever persisted for a mean of five days and meningeal signs for a mean of four days. Fifteen (8.0%) patients died: most [13] of them were admitted in coma, and two in shock. Death occurred in the first 48 h in ten cases. Sterilization of CSF was achieved in the first 72 h of treatment in 155 (90.1%) of the cured patients. Cefotaxime was well tolerated. CSF penetration of cefotaxime was evaluated in seven patients: concentrations ranged from 0.499 mg/l to 2.829 mg/l. Based on this clinical study, cefotaxime is an effective and safe drug for the treatment of childhood bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Septic shock and bacteremia associated with laparoscopic guided liver biopsy, report on two cases.
AB  - Two cases of infectious complications after liver biopsy are reported. Klebsiella pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were cultured. In both cases the biopsy was obtained under laparoscopic control. A 28-year-old woman with liver cirrhosis died 24 hours after liver biopsy as a result of septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation. A 67-year-old man with hepatic fibrosis suffered from transient bacteremia and recovered uneventfully after antibiotic therapy. In these patients, there was evidence to implicate pre-existing cholangitis as factor predisposing to postbiopsy bacteremia.
TI  - Pulmonary diseases in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus in  Zimbabwe, Central Africa.
AB  - During the 11 month period up to 30 September 1987, 37 patients (26 male, 11 female, mean age 27 years) with respiratory symptoms who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, were studied prospectively on 40 occasions to determine the cause of any pulmonary complications. HIV was heterosexually transmitted. Predominant symptoms were cough (89%), fever (89%), weight loss (83%), and dyspnoea (60%). Transnasal fibre-optic bronchoscopy (with bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushings and transbronchial lung biopsies) was performed on 35 patients, twice on 3 patients. 'Tru-cut' lung biopsies were obtained from 2 patients who died before bronchoscopy. Pulmonary tuberculosis was the commonest disease, being found in one-third of the patients (12 of 37). Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured from 4; the remainder of the plates were contaminated. Pneumocystis carinii was present in 8 patients: as the sole pathogen in 3, with Streptococcus pneumoniae in 4, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, and one also had tuberculous lymphadenitis. Endobronchial Kaposi's sarcoma was seen in 6 of 7 patients with skin nodules. Bacterial pathogens isolated included Staph. aureus (5), S. pneumoniae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), Haemophilus influenzae (2), H. parainfluenzae (1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). Invading Aspergillus fumigatus was diagnosed by lung biopsy in one. No diagnosis was reached for 8 patients. It is concluded that in Central Africa pulmonary complications in AIDS patients are similar to those in Europe and North America but the incidence of different pathogens depends on the prevalence of pathogens in the community. M. tuberculosis is probably the commonest pathogen. This study has confirmed that P. carinii pneumonia does occur, but occurs less frequently.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an oral cephalosporin.
AB  - We compared the in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of MDL 19,592, an  orally absorbed cephalosporin, with that of cephalexin and cefaclor. It inhabited Staphylococcus aureus at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.25 microgram/ml, sero groups B, C and G streptococci at 1 microgram/ml, and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 2 micrograms/ml. It was slightly more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. MDL 19,592 did not significantly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae, enterococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter spp. strains (MIC greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml). MDL 19,592 was not hydrolyzed by the plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1 of Klebsiella but was hydrolyzed by the TEM-3, Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase, and the chromosomal-mediated Enterobacter cloacae P99 enzymes.
TI  - [Evaluation of the causative bacteria of pneumonia in the elderly in recent years].
AB  - A study of 62 cases of elderly pneumonia (EP) in their sixties and eighties with  etiologic bacteria confirmed by cultures of sputum, blood or pleural effusion was carried out Greater change of etiologic bacteria of EP in patients of eighties has been found when they were compared with those of sixties. In the group of eighties the incidence of Gram-negative bacilli increased (77%), including pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.39%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.35%) and Enteric coli (9.68%), while Staphylococcus aureus accounted only for 16.1%. There were 2 species of Streptococcus pneumoniae; both were mixed with other bacteria in cultures. In patients of eighties the etiologic agents isolated from pneumonia were more resistant to many common antibiotics. The above mentioned results suggest that the diagnosis of etiology of pneumonia in the elderly should be emphasized.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on cefpodoxime proxetil (CPDX-PR, CS-807), a newly developed oral cephem, were carried out in the treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics. 1. Since CPDX demonstrates very powerful antimicrobial actions against such Gram-negative bacilli as Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia sp., such Gram-positive cocci as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase producing Branhamella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae, this drug was thought to be useful for the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases when main causative bacteria in the field of pediatrics were taken into account. 2. When changes in blood and urine concentrations of CPDX following the administration of this drug at 3.7 mg/kg before meal were determined, Cmax and T1/2 were found to be 2.98 micrograms/ml at 2-hour and 1.73 hours, respectively; an urinary excretion rate in the first 6 hours and a maximum urine concentration were 32.5% and 52 micrograms/ml, respectively. 3. Clinically, 8 of 8 patients with the upper respiratory tract infections (100%), 28 of 29 patients with bronchitis and/or pneumonia (96.6%), 3 of 4 patients with otitis media (75%), 2 of 2 patients with sinusitis (100%), 3 of 3 patients with the skin soft tissue infections (100%), 1 of 1 patient with bacterial enteritis (100%) and 11 of 14 patients with urinary tract infections (78.6%) responded well to the treatment with CPDX-PR, showing a 91.8% efficacy rate in all the patients treated. 4. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, B. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium were all eradicated from 5, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 5, 11 and 1 patient, respectively. An eradication rate in all the patients examined was 97.5% (39/40). 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms appeared as side effects in 2 of 71 patients (vomiting in 1 and diarrhea in 1), hence, an incidence of side effects was 2.8% (2/71). As for abnormal laboratory findings, eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and increases in GOT and GPT were observed in 3 of 39 patients examined (7.7%), 1 of 39 patients (2.6%) and 2 of 34 patients (5.9%), respectively. In addition, we also examined the effect of the drug on the hemostatic system, but found no changes upon the treatment. Based on these results, it appeared that CPDX-PR was a useful and safe drug in treatment of infectious diseases in the field of pediatrics when administered 2-3 times a day at a dose of 3-6 mg/kg.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new carbapenem, SM-7338.
AB  - SM-7338, a new carbapenem, inhibited most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae at MICs of 0.015 to 0.25 microgram/ml, including Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus vulgaris isolates resistant to cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and gentamicin. It was two- to eightfold more active than imipenem, but it inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1 to 8 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of imipenem. Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml, which was superior to the activity of imipenem. SM-7338 inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at 0.25 microgram/ml, but for methicillin-resistant isolates MICs were 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. Group A, B, and C streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. Bacteroides species, including clindamycin-resistant isolates, were inhibited by 0.25 microgram/ml. There was no major inoculum size effect, and the MBCs were within a dilution of the MICs. SM-7338 was more active than imipenem at an acid pH under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid beta-lactamases of TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-3, TEM-5, SHV-1, SHV-2, PSE-1, PSE-2, PSE-3, OXA-2, OXA-3, OXA-4, OXA-5, and OXA-7; Staphylococcus aureus enzymes; and the chromosomal beta-lactamases P-99 and K-1; Morganella species; and Proteus vulgaris did not hydrolyze SM-7338. The repeated transfer of organisms increased the MICs of SM-7338, as it did the MICs of imipenem.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091.
AB  - The in vitro activity of a new quinolone, AM-1091 [7-(3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl)-8-chloro-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro- 4-oxo- 3-quinoline carboxylic acid hydrochloride], was compared with those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, beta-lactams, and gentamicin. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. For many species AM-1091 was 2-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and 2- to 32-fold more active than ofloxacin. It inhibited Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Klebsiella species resistant to ceftazidime and gentamicin. Ninety percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, so for this species AM-1091 was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin. AM-1091 was more active against Pseudomonas cepacia and Xanthomonas maltophilia, inhibiting isolates resistant to imipenem and gentamicin. Most Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Branhamella catarrhalis isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MICs for 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Enterococcus faecalis isolates were 0.06, 0.06, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. AM-1091 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.25 micrograms/ml and was more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against gram-positive species. AM-1091 inhibited 90% of the Bacteroides species at 0.5 micrograms/ml. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was less than 10(-10) for most organisms, but resistant strains could be selected by repeated subculturing. Although AM-1091 had lower in vitro activity at pH 5.5 and in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+, it still inhibited most organisms at </= 0.5 micrograms/ml under these conditions. AM-1091 rapidly killed Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa and had a prolonged postantibiotic suppressive effect on these bacteria.
TI  - Penetration of newer cephalosporins into cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - A review of the world literature on the penetration (ratio of concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid to concentrations of serum) and attainable antibiotic concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in humans for cefuroxime, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, cefmenoxime, cefamandole, cefoperazone, moxalactam, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone indicates that, with the exceptions of cefamandole and cefoperazone, all agents appear equivalent. We conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. For the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for P. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.
TI  - [Clinical experience with cefodizime on pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefodizime (THR-221, CDZM), a newly developed injectable cephem antibiotic, was injected intravenously to 13 cases of pediatric infections. Patients received the drug at a dose level of approximately 20 mg/kg x 3 times daily. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 4 patients, good in 6 and poor in 0 for 10 cases (2 phlegmon, 1 periproctal abscess, 5 pneumonia and 2 bronchitis) except 3 Mycoplasma pneumonia. 2. Three strains of pathogens were followed for their changes (Streptococcus pyogenes in 1 phlegmon, Klebsiella pneumoniae in periproctal abscess and Haemophilus influenzae in 1 bronchitis) and they were found to have been eliminated. 3. No adverse reactions occurred. Abnormal changes in laboratory test data found were 2 cases of eosinophilia, 1 cash each of increased GOT and GPT, and thrombocytosis, but none of them was severe.
TI  - [Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of cefodizime in children].
AB  - Cefodizime (CDZM, THR-221), a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated for its clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Antimicrobial activities Antimicrobial activities of CDZM against clinically isolated organisms were determined. MICs of CDZM against 1 strain each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.05 micrograms/ml to 0.10 micrograms/ml. Especially, MIC against all 6 strains of Haemophilus influenzae was less than or equal to 0.024 micrograms/ml. This MIC value was lower than those of other antibiotics such as cefotaxime, cefotiam, cefazolin, piperacillin. 2. Pharmacokinetics CDZM was given to 1 case at a dose of 20 mg/kg by a 60-minute intravenous drip infusion. The peak value of serum concentration of CDZM was 207.80 micrograms/ml at the end of the infusion. The half-life was 2.15 hours. The mean urinary excretion rate was 68.5% in the first 4 hours, 79.2% in 6 hours and 76.5% in 8 hours after the 30-minute drip infusion. 3. Clinical efficacy CDZM was given to a total of 27 patients, 13 with pneumonia, 1 with bronchitis, 2 with acute pharyngitis, 1 with purulent tonsillitis, 5 with urinary tract infection, 1 each with retrograde cholangitis, acute enteritis, pericementitis, phlegmon and inguinal lymphadenitis. Overall clinical efficacies were excellent in 5 cases, good in 17 and the efficacy rate was 81%. Bacteriological effects were investigated in 13 cases and the eradication rate was 85%. No adverse reactions were observed in any case. As abnormal laboratory findings, elevated GOT, GPT, A1-P, LAP and gamma-GTP, were noted in 1 out of the 28 cases examined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine isolated from Prosopis juliflora.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of julifloricine, an alkaloid isolated from Prosopis juliflora, was studied in vitro against 40 microorganisms which included 31 bacteria, two Candida species, five dermatophytic fungi and two viruses. Significant inhibitory effect was noted against Gram positive bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. citreus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Sarcina lutea was 1 microgram/ml and against S. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. lactis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, C. hofmannii and Bacillus subtilis, 5 micrograms/ml. Its effect was compared with those of identical concentrations of benzyl penicillin, gentamicin and trimethoprim. The inhibitory effect of julifloricine on Gram negative bacteria such as the species of Salmonella, Shigella, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Aeromonas and Vibrio was almost insignificant. Julifloricine as compared to micoanzole was found superior against C. tropicalis and responded equally to C. albicans. As compared to econazole, it was found less effective against both C. albicans and C. tropicalis. This alkaloid was found inactive against dermatophytic fungi (up to a dose of 10 micrograms/ml) and viruses which included Herpes simplex 1 and Newcastle disease virus. Julifloricine up to a doses of 1000 micrograms/25 g of mice was found nonlethal.
TI  - Comparative activity of cefixime and cefaclor in an in vitro model simulating human pharmacokinetics.
AB  - The dependence of the antibacterial activity of the two oral cephalosporins cefixime and cefaclor on pharmacokinetic properties was investigated in an in vitro model using strains of enterobacteria and a streptococcal strain. In the cultures the course of serum concentrations of the respective antibiotic was simulated. The more rapidly attained (1 h) high peak levels (17.5 micrograms/ml) of cefaclor (500 mg dose) in no case showed an advantage over the more slowly reached (3 h) low peak levels (2.5 micrograms/ml) of cefixime (200 mg dose). Cefixime was comparable to cefaclor with respect to its initial killing velocity, whereas it was generally superior with respect to maximum values for reduction of bacterial counts. Due to its long elimination half-life (2.5 h) cefixime prevented regrowth for at least twice as long as cefaclor, which has a short half-life (0.7 h). As a result of its antibacterial activity and pharmacokinetic properties cefixime can be administered less frequently than cefaclor.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of lomefloxacin SC 47111 (NY-198) and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens.
AB  - The bacterial activity of lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin against selected pathogens was compared using kill-kinetic methods to assess inhibitory (1 x MIC) and suprainhibitory (4 x MIC) concentrations. Five strains each of the following microorganisms were studied: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that lomefloxacin was 8- to 16-fold less active than ciprofloxacin as measured by MICs. However, the bactericidal activities of both lomefloxacin and ciprofloxacin were comparable when concentrations 1 x MIC and 4 x MIC were tested. For many of the isolates tested, such concentrations would be achieved clinically. The low MICs seen for the Gram-negative bacilli did not correlate with killing ability for either drug: concentrations 8-16 x MIC were needed for 99.9% killing of the final inoculum. Although higher concentrations of lomefloxacin are needed for inhibitory and bactericidal activity, the improved pharmacokinetics of lomefloxacin may result in this agent being comparable to ciprofloxacin.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of cefteram comparison with other oral antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobacterial activities of cefteram (CFTM) against clinical isolates collected in 1988 were compared with those of new beta-lactams. 1. Antibacterial activities of CFTM against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis isolated from acute respiratory tract infections were 8- to 16-fold higher than those of cefaclor (CCL). 2. Activities of cefixime (CFIX) were superior to those of CFTM against B. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, but were inferior to CFTM against S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. Activities of cefuroxime were superior to those of CCL against each of the 4 tested bacterial species from acute respiratory tract infection and S. aureus by 4-fold, but were inferior to CFTM and CFIX against most of Gram-negative rods. 4. Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is considered to have an activity to inhibit beta-lactamase, but its MICs did not exceed the MICs of ampicillin by itself. SBTPC showed poor antibacterial activities against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Considering these observations, it is apparent that we are faced with a variety of factors in selecting antibiotics for best results.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  - Imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. To test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several Medical Centers in Brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding MIC were carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of S. Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding MIC correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). Of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (E. coli), 93% (Pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (Staphylococcus aureus), 100% (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (Klebsiella sp), 97% (Proteus mirabiles), 94% (Enterobacter sp), 100% (Streptococcus faecalis) with good MIC correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species Bacteroides sp (MIC up to 4 micrograms/ml). "In vitro" efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably Bacteroides sp is emphasized.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin in the urine during the 4 days following  a single 400 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of lomefloxacin was studied in the urine after single dose of 400 mg in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 7 periods: 0-3 h, 3-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-48 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h. Lomefloxacin concentration were assayed in all samples by microbiological method. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis. MIC's of lomefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.06, 0.50, 0.50, 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml. Lomefloxacin mean concentrations were 208.5 +/- 44.2, 104.3 +/- 15.2, 100.5 +/- 17.9, 36.8 +/- 8.2, 9.6 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples. Low levels were present in urine the 4th day. Mean urine elimination percentage was 62.2 +/- 4.2% for the four days, with extreme values from 91.2 to 41.8%. Urine bacteriostatic activity against enterobacteriacae was greater than or equal to 32 the first day reaching 8,192 for the Nal-S E. Coli, it was greater than or equal to 4 the second day. Against staphylococcus it was greater than or equal to 64 the first day, greater than or equal to 16 the second day. Against enterococcus it was greater than or equal to 4 the first day. Against the strains implicated in UTI a bacteriostatic activity was present during 2 days in all subjects.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin in the urine during the 7 days following a  single 800 mg oral dose].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of pefloxacin was studied in the urine after a single 800  mg oral dose in ten healthy female volunteers. Urine was collected in 9 periods: 0-6 h, 6-12 h, 12-24 h, 24-28 h, 48-72 h, 72-96 h, 96-120 h, 120-144 h, 144-168 h. Pefloxacin concentrations were assayed in all samples by a microbiological method and by HPLC. Urine antibacterial activity was determined towards five bacterial strains isolated in urine: 2 E. Coli strains, one sensitive and the other resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-A), 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to nalidixic acid (Nal-B), 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus and 1 Streptococcus faecalis; MIC's of pefloxacin against these strains were respectively 0.015, 0.25, 1, 0.50 and 2 micrograms/ml. Pefloxacin mean concentrations as determined by the microbiological method were 91.8 +/- 11.9, 71.7 +/- 7, 44.5 +/- 4.3, 24.4 +/- 4 and 5.4 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml in the five first urine samples; low levels were present in the urine until the 7th day in 8 volunteers. HPLC results completed the already known data concerning pefloxacin elimination and metabolism; unchanged pefloxacin was excreted at the highest concentration during the 6 first hours; then demethylpefloxacin was eliminated at higher levels than pefloxacin with a ratio of 2/1 after the 24th hour. These two compounds were detectable in the urine during 5 to 7 days; oxodemethylpefloxacin and N-oxyde-pefloxacin were present in lower amounts and during a shorter period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical studies on septicemia and infective endocarditis encountered between 1985-1986].
AB  - Septicemia encountered at Kawasaki Municipal Hospital between 1985 and 1986 were  studied clinically. Forty six patients had monomicrobial and 5 has polymicrobial infections, respectively. Out of these 46 patients with septicemia, 17 were due to Escherichia coli, 7 were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 were due to Staphylococcus aureus. Ten patients had hepatobiliary, 7 had hematological, 7 had malignant diseases as underlying diseases, respectively. Out of 10 patients complicated with septic shock, 7 died. Twenty three patients were community acquired infections. The age of most of the patients were over 50. The mortality rate of more than 65-year-old patients were higher than that of other patients. Our of 5 patients with septicemia due to polymicrobial infection, only 1 patient with erythroleukemia died. Fifty patients were treated mainly with beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin or cefmetazole alone or in combination with aminoglycosides and so on. Three patients with infective endocarditis were encountered during this period. Two were due to alpha-streptococcus and 1 was due to Enterococcus. A 41-year-old patient with mitral valve insufficiency and metastatic gastric carcinoma to the bone marrow were complicated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. This patient, however, was successfully treated with a daily dose of 24 mega units of benzylpenicillin, and was given gabexate mesilate, concomitantly.
TI  - Rapid detection of Bordetella pertussis by a monoclonal antibody-based colony blot assay.
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies to Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used in a colony blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay designed for rapid detection of B. pertussis. Bacterial colonies from Bordet-Gengou agar plates were blotted onto nitrocellulose filter disks, lysed by immersion in chloroform, and reacted with monoclonal antibodies. Following reaction with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antisera and 4-chloro-1-naphthol, blue dots representing single colonies appeared on the filters. Blotting of single B. pertussis colonies could be performed after incubation for 40 h, i.e., before the colonies were visible by eye on the agar surface. Ten of ten B. pertussis strains showed positive blotting reactions with antibodies specific for B. pertussis FHA and LPS. Fourteen of fourteen B. parapertussis strains reacted with two of the FHA-specific antibodies but not with two of the LPS-specific antibodies. Strains of B. bronchiseptica showed a variable reaction pattern. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Streptococcus mitis, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Branhamella catarrhalis, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. This assay may be useful for identification of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis in suspected cases of whooping cough.
TI  - Opsonic activity of a new intravenous immunoglobulin preparation: Pentaglobin compared with sandoglobulin.
AB  - Standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use consist predominantly of IgG (greater than 95%). We have compared the ability of a standard preparation (Sandoglobulin) with that of a new preparation (Pentaglobin, containing 12% IgM and 12% IgA) to improve the opsonic activity of antibody-deficient human sera in vitro. Panhypogammaglobulinaemic sera were poorly opsonic for five of six organisms tested, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but opsonized Staphylococcus aureus almost normally. Both immunoglobulin preparations significantly improved the opsonic activity of the antibody-deficient sera for most organisms. The major difference between the two preparations was the ability of Pentaglobin to supply opsonins for P. aeruginosa, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, while Sandogloblin was significantly more potent in opsonins for Haemophilus influenzae. Pentaglobin demonstrates significant in vitro opsonic activity, particularly for enterobacteria (coliforms) and P. aeruginosa. Its content of IgM antibodies appears to confer special properties on Pentaglobin not seen with standard preparations of immunoglobulin for intravenous use. Its place in clinical practice remains to be determined but it may have a possible role in augmenting host defence mechanisms in Gram-negative septicaemia.
TI  - Mechanisms of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous: correlation  of complement consumption with opsonic activity and protective efficacy.
AB  - To study the mechanism of bacterial opsonization by immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) complement consumption and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL) membrane receptor (FcRlo, CR1, and CR3)-mediated phagocytosis of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and groups A and B streptococci were examined. IGIV alone did not consume complement and showed no opsonic activity by itself for these organisms. When these bacteria were preopsonized in IGIV, significant amounts of complement were consumed (44%-94%) and the uptake and killing of bacteria occurred. The in vitro opsonic activity of IGIV for these organisms was significantly correlated with the amount of complement consumed by the IGIV-opsonized bacteria (r = .85, P less than .05). The in vivo protective efficacy of IGIV also appeared to be directly associated with its ability to activate and consume complement (r = 1.0, P less than .001). Antibodies to FcRlo (Leu 11) markedly inhibited phagocytosis of bacteria opsonized in IGIV but not that of bacteria opsonized in specific IgM. Both CR1 and CR3 receptors on PMNLs were involved in uptake, but the contribution of each is different with different organisms.
TI  - Prophylactic co-trimoxazole versus norfloxacin in neutropenic children--perspective randomized study.
AB  - Co-trimoxazole or norfloxacin were randomly administered to 44 granulocytopenic children with malignancies in order to prevent bacterial infections. Although more patients in the co-trimoxazole group had febrile episodes (p less than 0.01), the mean of febrile days and the mean of days with systemic antibiotics did not differ significantly in the two groups. Five patients in the co-trimoxazole group had a microbiologically documented infection (four with septicemia) due to Escherichia coli (n = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sp. There were four septicemic episodes in the norfloxacin group due to P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus faecalis. Compliance was good during administration of both drugs. No signs or symptoms of arthropathy were seen in the norfloxacin group. The number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). Norfloxacin did not select resistant strains and was very active in eradicating gram-negative bacilli from stools (27.5% of positive cultures).
TI  - A clinical evaluation of sulbactam/ampicillin in the treatment of pediatric infections.
AB  - We have treated 42 episodes of pediatric infections with sulbactam/ampicillin since 1987. Included were 9 cellulitis, 9 urinary tract infections, 5 cervical lymphadenitis, 4 meningitis, 2 thoracic empyema, 2 osteomyelitis, 2 sepsis, 1 furuncle, 1 perianal abscess, 1 dental abscess, 1 peritonsillitis, 1 salmonellosis, 1 shigellosis, 1 peritonitis, 1 suppurative thyroiditis, 1 infective endocarditis. Responsible pathogens were Escherichia coli in 8, Staphylococcus aureus in 6, Hemophilus influenzae in 2, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 3, Streptococcus viridans in 2, Staphylococcus epidermidis in 1, Bacteroides fragilis in 1, Salmonella D1 in 1, Shigella sonnei in 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 1, Enterobacter agglomerans in 1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 1, Enterobacter cloacae in 1, group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in 1, and polymicrobial infection in 4 cases. Thirty-nine out of 41 (95%) clinically evaluable patients cured and all (34/34) bacteriologically evaluable patients eradicated their pathogens after treatment with sulbactam/ampicillin. Side reactions were seen in five patients; one maculopapular skin rash, one hemolytic anemia, two diarrhea, and one liver function impairment plus leukopenia. All these reactions were transient and did not require interruption of therapy. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin is safe and effective in the treatment of common pediatric infections beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - [Therapy of chronic recurrent respiratory tract infections].
AB  - In 1987, the most frequently identified pathogens in chronic respiratory tract infections in our clinic were Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Branhamella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Recurrent infection is a common phenomenon in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. H. influenzae is the most common pathogen in such patients. Macrolides, tetracyclines and new quinolones were effective to protect against recurrent infection of H. influenzae and these finding suggested that L-forms of H. influenzae may be significant in the recurrence of infection in patients with chronic respiratory tract infection. Bacterial colonization of the oropharynx is the initial event in most lower respiratory tract infections. Gargling protects against bacteria colonization of the oropharynx and occurrence of acute exacerbation.
TI  - [Urinary tract infections in primary care: predominant microbes and their antibiotic sensitivity].
AB  - We have prospectively evaluated 227 episodes of community-acquired urinary tract  infection (UTI) from October 1st to December, 15th, 1987. The urine samples, adequately collected, were processed in the Bacteriology Laboratory of the Albacete General Hospital. E. coli was the most commonly isolated organism (62%), followed by Proteus mirabilis (6.6%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.6%), Serratia marcescens (6.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6.2%). As regards the sensitivity of E. coli to the most commonly used antibiotics, there was a 56% resistance to ampicillin, 37% to cotrimoxazole, 40% to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, and 46% to cephalothin. These are in contrast with the small number of resistance, at least in vitro, to urinary chemotherapeuticals and phosphomycin. We emphasize the importance of the knowledge of the organisms more commonly involved in UTI and their updated sensitivity to antimicrobials for the best management of these infections.
TI  - [Serious infections in alcoholics. 2. Etiology of bacteremia and meningitis in alcoholics discharged from hospitals in Funen 1981, 1984 and 1986].
AB  - In 1981, 1984 and 1986 relatively more episodes of bacteremia with Corynebacterium in one or two tubes out of twelve were found in alcoholics and these normally negligible episodes may be a iatrogenic marker of intubation and esophagoscopy in alcoholics. Definite bacteremic episodes with E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Streptococcus faecalis, haemolytic Streptococcus and Bacteroides were found in 0.79% of alcoholics and 0.37% of non-alcoholics (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001). The frequency per 100,000 discharged patients with positive blood cultures irrespective of bacteriological diagnosis, and also alcoholic liver cirrhosis was 8.12 = about two thirds of the number of deaths from cirrhosis per year. In selected cases of severe infections in alcoholics, the frequency of cirrhosis or steatosis was 29/48 = 60%. Foci were more often demonstrated bacteriologically in patients without cirrhosis or steatosis (0.01 greater than p greater than 0.001). Bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus was a complication of treatment 6-18 days from admission, whereas bacteremia with E. coli and Pneumococci was present on admission. Serious bacteremia in alcoholics was not found in patients over 70 years of age and the many geriatric alcoholics (4.7%) did not show a greater morbidity than the average geriatric patient. The mortality of bacteremic alcoholics was more than 45% over a 6-year period.
TI  - Role of fluoroquinolones in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Oral quinolones such as ciprofloxacin are promising agents in the treatment of serious bronchopulmonary infections due to susceptible gram-negative micro-organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and even Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their moderative activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae may limit the use of these agents in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and in the empiric management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Further prospectively designed studies are needed to address this issue. The ability of quinolones to effectively penetrate bronchial mucosa and to be concentrated within macrophages may afford additional advantage to these agents. They should not be used as a sole agent in the treatment of aspiration pneumonia nor anaerobic pleuropulmonary disease. Quinolones are very active in experimental models of Legionnaire's disease and deserve further clinical study. Ciprofloxacin is a promising alternative to standard parenteral drugs in the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in adults with cystic fibrosis. The potential for drug interactions with theophylline must be kept in mind for patients on both of these drugs.
TI  - [The ratios and kinds of clinical bacteria isolated in Taiwan's large-size hospitals].
AB  - The prevalence of clinical bacteria, as isolated from Linko Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital (2,300 beds) in the period January 1985 to December 1986 and from Taipei Veterans General Hospital (2,300 beds) during the period January 1986 to December 1986, was analyzed with the following findings: (i) The isolation ratio of anaerobic and aerobic or facultative bactria during the period of investigation were 7.8% (5,513/70,799) and 92.2% (65,286/70,799), respectively. (ii) Of the total aerobic or facultative isolates from the two hospitals, 32.9% (21,510/65,286) were Gram positive cocci and bacilli, 67.1% (43,776/65,286) were Gram negative cocci and bacilli. (iii) Of these Gram-negative bacilli, 65.2% (28,490/43,675) were Enterobacteriaceae were Enterobacteriaceae and glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli, 32.0% (13,984/43,675) were glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, and 2.7% (1,200/43,675) were fastidious Gram negative bacilli. (iv) The more common species among the members of Enterobacteriaceae were Escherichia coli 35.7% (10,163/28,490), and Klebsiella pneumoniae 18.2% (5,186/28,490). The other common species included Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus vulgaris. The frequencies of Salmonella species and Shigella species in these two large hospitals were up to 1.6% (456/28,490) and 0.5% (149/28,490), respectively. The most common isolate among other glucose fermentative Gram negative bacilli was Aeromonas hydrophila 3.0% (843/28,490). The finding of 0.1% (11/28,490) Vibrio alginolyticus was considered as clinically significant in Taiwan. (v) Of these glucose nonfermentative Gram negative bacilli, 69.4% (9,704/13,984) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 18.9% (2,637/13,984) Acinetobacter species, 10.8% (1,516/13,984) Pseudomonas species. (vi) The most common bacteria among fastidious Gram negative bacilli was Haemophilus influenzae, 96.2% (1,154/1,200). (vii) Of these Gram negative cocci, 59.4% (60/101) was Neisseria gonorrhoeae and 6.9% (7/101) N. meningitidis. (viii) The more common isolates of Gram positive bacilli included Bacillus species and Corynebacterium species (diphtheroids). (ix) Of these Gram positive cocci, the isolation rates of Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species were 54.6% (10,838/19,827) and 45.4% (9,002/19,847), respectively. The most common isolate among Gram positive cocci was Staphylococcus aureus, 30.2% (5,994/19,847); the next, enterococcus, 24.9% (4,936/19,847); then S. epidermidis, 22.2% (4,390/19,847). The less common isolates were Streptococcus pyogenes 1.1% (212/19,847) and S. pneumoniae, 1.7% (329/19,847).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
TI  - Stimulation of cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic functions of natural killer cells by bacterial membrane proteoglycans and ribosomes.
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the effect of membrane proteoglycans (MPG) from Klebsiella pneumoniae on the function of human natural killer (NK) cells. MPG combined with bacterial ribosomes from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae, constitute a bacterial immunomodulator (MS D 53), currently in clinical use. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) exposed in vitro to MPG or MS D 53 for 20 h showed enhanced NK cytotoxicity. Augmentation of NK cytotoxicity depended upon a direct effect on NK cells, inasmuch as these compounds were also effective on highly purified large granular lymphocytes (LGL). We also studied the effects of MPG on non-cytotoxic functions of NK cells, namely in vitro locomotion and production of IL-1. MPG (and MS D 53) induced IL-1 release in LGL. Moreover, MPG-treated LGL showed enhanced locomotory activity, as assessed by measuring the penetration into nitrocellulose filters. The capacity of MPG (and MS D 53) to activate cytotoxic and noncytotoxic functions of NK cells may contribute to enhancement of nonspecific resistance in vivo after treatment with this agent.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin in the therapy of severe infections in high-risk patients.
AB  - A clinical trial was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment with  imipenem/cilastatin in life-threatening infections in high-risk patients. Thirty hospitalized patients (22 men and 8 women), aged 28 to 78 years, with impaired host defences and severe infections were treated with imipenem/cilastatin at a dosage ranging between 1 and 3 g daily i.v. at 8 or 12 h intervals. The average length of therapy was 8.61 +/- 3.14 days. The isolated organisms were as follows: Escherichia coli [7], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [9], Staphylococcus aureus [5], Streptococcus faecalis [3], Strep. viridans [1], Proteus mirabilis [1], P. vulgaris [2], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], Citrobacter freundii [2], Bacteroides fragilis [2]. In only one patient the aetiological agent remained unknown and in five patients (16.67%) a mixed infection was observed. Twenty-four patients (80%) were completely cured of infection and 29 isolated organisms (82.86%) were eradicated. No important side-effects were observed.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin and other unrelated antimicrobials against bacterial respiratory tract pathogens.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new fluorinated 4-quinolone with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity which includes both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In this study the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin has been determined against bacteria associated with respiratory tract infections and compared with that of other antimicrobial agents used in the therapy of such infections. Ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.008 mg/l) was highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, including isolates producing beta-lactamase which were resistant to amoxycillin. Ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) was also highly active against Branhamella catarrhalis, again including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin as a result of beta-lactamase production. Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae were less susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 2 mg/l) but were highly susceptible to amoxycillin (MIC90 less than 0.12 mg/l) and erythromycin (MIC90 0.25 mg/l). Isolates of Klebsiella aerogenes were highly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but much less so to amoxycillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, oxytetracycline and erythromycin. Ciprofloxacin (MIC90 0.5 mg/l) was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, including those isolates resistant to amoxycillin and flucloxacillin, and against Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Together with rifampicin and erythromycin, ciprofloxacin was highly active against Legionella pneumophila (MIC90 0.015 mg/l). These results suggest that clinical evaluation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of respiratory tract infections is justified.
TI  - Bacteriological findings after premature rupture of the membranes.
AB  - Of 243 children born after premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) 61 (26%) had the same bacteria in placental arterial blood, in ear swabs (taken deep from the external auditory canal) and in meconium. The predominant organisms were E. coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus faecalis (enterococci) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci). The infection rate was only 10% if the membranes had ruptured within 24 h of the onset of labour and 30% if the interval was longer than 24 h. Of 131 children born without premature rupture of the membranes but with risk factors for sepsis 9 (7%) had a positive blood culture with the same organism in the ear swabs and in meconium. The organisms were Streptococcus agalactiae (6 cases) and E. coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae (one case each). Contamination of placental blood cultures was rare.
TI  - [Clinically relevant pathogens isolated from blood cultures of inpatient treated  children (1972 to 1985)].
AB  - Blood cultures are extremely useful in diagnosing various bacteremic diseases in  childhood. The results obtained in this study are presented in relation to two periods of equal length (1972-1978, 1979-1985). At the present time there are about 22 relevant isolates from blood cultures per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatrics, and about 3 isolates per 1000 admitted children and year in the Department of Pediatric Surgery, respectively. From newborns we isolated most frequently E. coli, Staph. aureus, B-Streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and yeasts. From children beyond the first month of life Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staph. aureus were the most frequent identified etiologic agents. The main factors influencing the spectrum of agents causing bacteremia are: age of patients, status of hospitals, and applicated diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
TI  - Ceftriaxone monotherapy for severe bacteremic infections. Spanish Ceftriaxone Study Group.
AB  - We tested the efficacy of a single daily dose of ceftriaxone (active ingredient of Rocephin) for the treatment of severe bacteremic infections in 125 non-neutropenic adult patients. A single daily dose of ceftriaxone ranging from 1 to 4 g was given. Surgical procedures were performed if needed. Seventy-six (60.8%) were males and bacteremia was nosocomially acquired in 45 (36%). Microbiologically proven bacteremia was demonstrated in all patients. The most common microorganisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46 episodes), Streptococcus pneumoniae (17 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus (9, 7, 6, 6, respectively). The urinary tract was the source of the bacteremia in 45 cases (36%), and the lower respiratory tract in 33 (26.4%). Mean duration of treatment was 10.8 days (range 3-21 days). One hundred and six patients (84.8%) recovered completely, 11 (8.8%) improved, but needed an alternative antibiotic treatment. An alternative treatment was also given to a patient whose condition had initially deteriorated. Seven patients (5.6%) died. Death was directly related to the infection in 2 cases. Three patients (2.4%) developed a superinfection, and 5 (4%) a severe (1 case) or mild (4 cases) adverse effect. In summary, a single daily dose of ceftriaxone proved to be useful for the treatment of selected severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Immunomodulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes by D53 Immucytal and its constitutive fractions.
AB  - D53 (Immucytal) is a compositive vaccine made of immunogenic ribosomes extracted  from 4 bacterial species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae) associated with a membrane proteoglycan from a non-encapsulated strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae (MPG-Kp). In this work we have studied the effect of the compound on human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function "in vitro". We have demonstrated that D53 was able to significantly increase Fc- receptor dependent phagocytosis without modify the C3-receptor dependent activity. Furthermore D53 enhanced the oxidative metabolism (evaluated by chemiluminescence) both using cells in resting conditions or after stimulation with phagocytable or soluble stimuli. On the contrary D53 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of PMN migration toward different chemoattractants. Using the two constitutive fractions of the compound (ribosomes and proteoglycans) we have observed that the MPG-Kp component was mainly responsible for the modulating activity of the drug on human PMNs.
TI  - [Activity of cefpirome against bacteria isolated from hospitalized patients].
AB  - The activity of cefpirome (HR 810) was evaluated against 247 strains isolated from patients developing their infections while in a hospital in Buenos Aires. Its activity against Gram negative bacilli was compared with ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cephalotin, piperacillin, amikacin, gentamicin and norfloxacin. In terms of MIC50 and MIC90 (mg/l) it was as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae: less than 0.125, less than 2.0; Pseudomonas aeruginosa: less than 8, less than 16; Escherichia coli: less than 0.016, less than 0.063; Serratia marcescens: less than 0.063, less than 1.0; Enterobacter cloacae: less than 0.125, less than 1.0. Cefpirome was more active than the other cephalosporins against P. aeruginosa: at 16 mg/l, this drug inhibited 95% of strains versus 60% for ceftazidime and 32% for ceftriaxone. Activity of norfloxacine against Gram negative bacilli was similar to cefpirome, while piperacillin and the aminoglycosides were less active. Cefpirome was more active than cepahallotin against Streptococcus faecalis (2.0, 32) although less active than ampicillin, piperacillin, rifampicin and vancomycin. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (less than 0.25, less than 1.0) it was more active than cephalotin and the other drugs evaluated (piperacillin, erythromycin, chloranphenicol, aminogycosides). Like cephalotin, the activity of cefpirome against methicillin-resistant strains was variable (1.0, 32).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FK482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. It displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. FK482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (CFIX), cefaclor (CCL) or cephalexin (CEX) against clinical isolates of Gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci including Staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the Streptococcus group. Moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Against clinical isolates of many Gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, FK482 had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of CFIX but superior to that of CCL or CEX. However, it was clearly inferior to CFIX in activity against Serratia marcescens, and was inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains of S. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to FK482. All tested strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to CCL and CEX were susceptible to FK482, as were all the strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (AMPC). FK482, like CFIX, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except Bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of CCL or CEX. The antibacterial activity of FK482 against CSH2 strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. FK482 showed higher affinity for the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (3, 2 and 1) of S. aureus than did CFIX, CCL and CEX. FK482 also showed very high affinity for the PBPs (2 and 3) of E. faecalis and PBPs (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of E. coli. The bactericidal activity of FK482 against S. aureus was almost as strong as that of AMPC and superior to that of CCL or CEX. Against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis, FK482 was similar to CFIX and superior to CCL and CEX in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Augmentation of host resistance to microbial infections by recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha.
AB  - Recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha augmented resistance of mice to microbial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Candida albicans. The effective doses of interleukin-1 alpha ranged from 0.01 to 10 micrograms per mouse, depending on the infecting organism, route of administration, and challenge dose. Intravenous interleukin-1 alpha was, dose for dose, more effective than intravenous muramyl dipeptide and lentinan against the P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae infections. Augmentation by interleukin-1 alpha of resistance to infection was also observed in P. aeruginosa-infected mice in a state of cyclophosphamide-induced leucopenia. Interleukin-1 alpha may be useful for controlling obstinate infections not curable by antimicrobial agents alone.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of FK482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - The therapeutic activities of orally administered FK482 were compared with those  of reference antibiotics against systemic and local infections with a variety of bacteria in mice and rabbits. In systemic infections in mice, oral FK482 was almost as effective as oral cefaclor (CCL) and more effective than oral cephalexin (CEX) against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis infections. However, FK482 afforded superior protective activity when given subcutaneously against E. coli infection in mice, and this activity was more potent than that of subcutaneously given CCL. In comparison with CCL, the reason that the in vivo activity of orally given FK482 against mouse systemic infections was weaker than had been anticipated from its potent in vitro activity was due to its poor oral absorption in mice. In local infections in rabbits, a species in which FK482 was better absorbed than in mice, FK482 was more effective than CCL, CEX or amoxicillin (AMPC). Against pneumonia induced by S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, FK482 was as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the lungs of infected rabbits. In the oral treatment of experimental ascending pyelonephritis in rabbits, FK482 was superior to CCL and AMPC against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection, as effective as AMPC and more effective than CCL against Enterococcus faecalis infection, and as effective as cefixime (CFIX) and more effective than CCL and AMPC against E. coli infection in reducing the number of viable bacteria in the kidneys and urine.
TI  - Group B streptococci inhibit the chemotactic activity of the fifth component of complement.
AB  - Infection with group B streptococci (GBS) is associated with a poor acute inflammatory response in which neutrophils fail to localize at the site of invasion. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of group B streptococci on C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Fresh human serum was activated to form C5a and C5adesarg by incubation with zymosan. The activated serum was then incubated with group B organisms, centrifuged, and the supernatants tested for chemotactic activity for human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Group B organisms caused a dose-dependent decrease in C-dependent chemotactic activity. The degree of inhibition was profound with 1 X 10(9) bacteria/ml (10% of control). Experiments indicated that significant chemotactic factor inactivation occurred within 2 min of exposure to GBS organisms, while maximal inhibition occurred after 30 min incubation. A number of different strains of GBS of types I, II, and III possessed inhibitory activity. In contrast, group D streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae failed to inhibit the C-derived chemotactic activity in human serum. Group A streptococci that were M protein positive also inactivated C-dependent chemotactic activity in serum, as previously reported. The inhibitory activity of the GBS strains could be abolished by heat or trypsin treatment but not by neuraminidase, pronase, or pepsin. C5a levels in zymosan-activated serum as measured by RIA were not decreased after incubation with an inhibitory strain suggesting that absorption was not involved. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that group B streptococci degrade the C5a molecule, increasing its electrophoretic mobility by removing a fragment with a m.w. of approximately 650 Da. Thus, one of the reasons for the poor inflammatory response at the site of GBS infection may reside in the ability of these pathogens to inactivate C-derived inflammatory mediators. The GBS C5a-ase activity probably serves as an additional virulence factor for these organisms contributing to the poor inflammatory response characteristic of group B streptococcal infection.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefoperazone. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - To interpret of the cefoperazone (CPZ) disc susceptibility test, a 4 category system is used in Japan, but a 3 category system is used in the U.S.A. and Europe. In the 4 category interpretation system of Showa CPZ disc the following classification is used: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3 approximately 15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15 approximately 60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC greater than 60 micrograms/ml. In the 3 category system the classification used is as follows: susceptible MIC less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, or susceptible MIC less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible MIC greater than 32 approximately 64 micrograms/ml, resistant MIC greater than 64 micrograms/ml, depending on dose levels, 1 or 2 g. Reliability of the CPZ disc susceptibility test in estimating approximate MICs by classifying the test results into 4 categories was studied using discs containing 1, 2, 5, 10, 30 and 75 micrograms. The MICs were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6) CFU/ml. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MICs, showing reliability of the test using these discs. The results obtained with discs containing 30 or 75 micrograms of CPZ were well categorized into the 4 groups mentioned above. Some strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, however, showed false positive results. When different break points of inhibitory zone diameters than those used for other bacteria were used for P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis was excluded from the test, an excellent correlations were obtained. With 30 or 75 micrograms discs, it was unable to subclassify strains against which MICs of CPZ were below 3 micrograms/ml. However, with discs containing 1 to 10 micrograms, it was possible to separate the strains against which MICs were less than 0.5 microgram/ml. The fact that most frequent values of MICs of CPZ against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes etc. were less than 0.5 microgram/ml supports the usefulness of low dose discs. According to recently ongoing concepts on the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics and their penetration into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding appear to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body. Only free, unbound drug molecules can readily pass through capillary pores into tissue fluids except into hepatic biliary system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dose of cefuzonam. Evaluation of disc susceptibility test and its interpretation system].
AB  - In vitro activities of cefuzonam (CZON) against 273 clinical isolates were studied through the evaluation of MIC's and the results of disc susceptibility test. The MIC's were determined using the agar dilution method at an inoculum level of 10(6)CFU/ml. The MIC80's of CZON against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Haemophilus influenzae and Citrobacter spp. were less than 0.20 microgram/ml. The MIC80's against Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were both 6.25 micrograms/ml, and that against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 100 micrograms/ml. The MIC80's against Staphy-lococcus epidermidis were 25 and 6.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Approximately 70% of strains of S. aureus were inhibited at concentrations less than 1.56 microgram/ml. For the interpretation of the CZON Showa 30 micrograms disc susceptibility test a 4 category system was used. In the 4 category system for Showa disc containing CZON, the following classification inhibitory zone diameters has been proposed: ( ) MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml, (++) MIC greater than 3-15 micrograms/ml, (+) MIC greater than 15-60 micrograms/ml, (-) MIC less than 60 micrograms/ml. Reliability of the CZON disc tests in estimating approximate MIC values was studied using Showa 30 micrograms discs and discs prepared in this laboratory containing 1-10 micrograms CZON. A good negative correlation was observed between inhibitory zone diameters and MIC's, showing the reliability of the disc method. The results of the test using Showa 30 micrograms disc against various clinical isolates were accurately classified into the 4 groups except those against P. aeruginosa. Some strains of P. aeuruginosa showed false positive results, exhibiting relatively larger inhibitory zone diameters compared with MIC's against these organisms. As CZON is not effective against P. aeruginosa a much better overall correlation between MIC's and the disc test would result when P. aeruginosa was excluded. With Showa 30 micrograms discs of various cephalosporins, sub-classification of strains with MIC less than 3 micrograms/ml cannot be achieved. In this study, however, it was demonstrated that differentiation of strains with MIC's less than 0.5-1.56 micrograms/ml was possible when discs containing 1-10 micrograms of CZON were used. According to recent concepts on pharmacokinetics for antibiotics including penetration of drugs into tissues and inflammatory fluids, serum protein binding of drugs appears to be one of the important determinants of drug distribution in the body.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Monoclonal antibody-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin.
AB  - Hybrid cell lines producing monoclonal antibodies against Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) were established. The specificity of the antibodies was ascertained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), sandwich ELISA, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting. The monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA was developed for detection of B. pertussis FHA. The assay had a detection limit of B. pertussis FHA in concentrations ranging from 7 to 15 ng/ml. The assay was also able to detect whole B. pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica bacteria. No cross-reactions were observed with strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus miteor, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The monoclonal antibodies might be useful for the detection of soluble antigens and whole bacteria in clinical samples and for studies of the immunochemical structure of B. pertussis FHA.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of sultamicillin against clinical isolates from upper respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Sultamicillin (SBTPC) is a mutual prodrug in which ampicillin (ABPC) and a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam (SBT) are ester-bound in an equimolar ratio. SBTPC is hydrolyzed during absorption after oral administration to provide ABPC and SBT for systemic circulation. In the present study, the antimicrobial activities of SBTPC against 50 isolates each of 6 species (Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes) of bacteria freshly obtained from upper respiratory tract infections were examined in relation to their bacterial beta-lactamase producing abilities. beta-Lactamase producing strains were identified using the acidometry disc method with benzylpenicillin (PCG) of cefazolin (CEZ) as a substrate, and their frequencies of appearance were calculated as follows: S. aureus 86%; K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae 100%; B. catarrhalis 68%; H. influenzae 24%. Fourteen per cent of S. aureus strains examined were beta-lactamase positive using both PCG and CEZ acidometry discs. SBTPC, however, demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activities even against these beta-lactamase producing strains. Good activities were observed especially against those bacterial strains producing penicillinase (PCase). Average MIC80 values of SBTPC were 3.13 micrograms/ml for S. aureus and K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, 0.39 micrograms/ml for B. catarrhalis and H. influenzae, 0.05 micrograms/ml for S. pneumoniae and 0.025 micrograms/ml for S. pyogenes. As SBTPC was shown to possess excellent antimicrobial activities against PCase producing strains, the enhancement in activities of SBTPC compared to ABPC alone can be attributed to the inhibition of beta-lactamase by SBT which, as noted above, is a component of SBTPC in an equimolar ratio to ABPC.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of S 6472 granule preparation (sustained-release cefaclor) in chronic bronchitis].
AB  - S 6472 granule preparation, a sustained-release cefaclor, was orally administered to 20 acutely exacerbated cases of chronic bronchitis at a daily dosage of 750 mg (titer) in 2 divided doses for a duration of 7-15 days and its clinical usefulness was evaluated. Clinical efficacies were good in 17 cases and fair in 3 cases, with a rate of efficacy of 85.0%. Organisms isolated from 13 patients were totalling 14 strains, i.e., 5 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis, 2 strains of Streptococcus sp., 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 strain of Haemophilus influenzae and 1 strain of Staphylococcus aureus. All these strains, except the strains of Streptococcus sp., disappeared upon the administration of the drug. With regard to the safety, no side effects nor abnormal laboratory test values were encountered.

TI  - Many pulmonary pathogenic bacteria bind specifically to the carbohydrate sequence GalNAc beta 1-4Gal found in some glycolipids.
AB  - Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of death from infectious disease in the United States. To examine the possible role of carbohydrates as adhesion receptors for infection, several pulmonary pathogenic bacteria were studied for binding to glycosphingolipids. Radiolabeled bacteria were layered on thin-layer chromatograms of separated glycosphingolipids, and bound bacteria were detected by autoradiography. The classic triad of infectious bacteria found in cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus, along with other bacteria commonly implicated in typical pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and certain Escherichia coli, bind specifically to fucosylasialo-GM1 (Fuc alpha 1-2Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Cer), asialo-GM1 (Gal beta 1-3GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta-1-4Galc beta 1-1Cer), and asialo-GM2 (GalNAc beta 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1Cer). Bacteria maintained in nutrient medium bind better than the same cells suspended in buffer. They do not bind to galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, trihexosylceramide, globoside, paragloboside, Forssman glycosphingolipid, or several other glycosphingolipids tested, including the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and Cad. The finding that these pathogens do not bind to lactosylceramide suggests that beta 1-4-linked GalNAc, which is positioned internally in fucosylasialo-GM1 and asialo-GM1 and terminally in asialo-GM2, is required for binding. beta-N-Acetylgalactosamine itself, however, is not sufficient for binding, as the bacteria did not bind to globoside, which contains the terminal sequence GalNAc beta 1-3Gal. These data suggest that these bacteria require at least terminal or internal GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequences unsubstituted with sialyl residues for binding. Other bacteria, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella species, and some E. coli, do not bind to the GalNAc beta 1-4Gal sequence. The biological relevance of these data is suggested by our finding that substantial amounts of asialo-GM1 occur in human lung tissue.
TI  - In-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of LY163892.
AB  - LY163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. It inhibited Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group B streptococci and groups C, F, G and bovis streptococci with MICs of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. MIC90 of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. LY163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with MIC90 values of 16 mg/l for Escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. It had no activity against Enterobacter, Providencia, Serratia, and Pseudomonas and Bacteroides spp. LY163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. It was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. For TEM-1, the Km = 354.7 microM, Vmax = 2.5 microMoles/min/mg of protein, P99 Km = 24.3 microM, Vmax = 28.9 microM/min/micrograms of protein, Staph. aureus PC Km = 47.4 microM, Vmax = 2.7 microMoles/min/mg of protein. Overall it had beta-lactamase stability similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.
TI  - Production of a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance by genital flora bacteria.
AB  - Bacteria contaminating amniotic fluid have anecdotally been shown to produce a phosphatidylglycerol-like substance, thus giving false positive tests for phosphatidylglycerol in vaginal pool fluid from patients with premature rupture of the membranes. Isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) were grown in broth and analyzed for the presence of phosphatidylglycerol-like material by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography and also by a polyclonal, immunologic slide agglutination test (Amniostat-FLM). All species demonstrated a positive test result for phosphatidylglycerol by either thin-layer chromatography, slide agglutination, or both. The material migrated separately from cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine as determined by chromatography, but identically with the phosphatidylglycerol control. Gram-negative species were more strongly positive than gram-positive organisms. Colony counts on the order of 10(8) colony-forming units per milliliter were necessary to give positive test results for phosphatidylglycerol. The possible clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

TI  - In vitro activity of an oral iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, R-3746.
AB  - The in vitro activity of R-3746, an iminomethoxy aminothiazolyl cephalosporin with a CH2OCH3 moiety at position 3, was compared with those of other antibiotics. R-3746 inhibited the majority of hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B, C, F, and G) and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than 0.06 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the activity of amoxicillin, 2- to 8-fold more active than cefixime, and 16- to 64-fold more active than cefaclor and cephalexin. Ninety percent of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were inhibited at a concentration 0.25 micrograms/ml, but it was less active against Branhamella spp. It did not inhibit (MIC, greater than 16 micrograms/ml) enterococci, viridans group streptococci, or methicillin-resistant staphylococci. The MICs of R-3746 for 90% of strains tested for Escherichia coli; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Citrobacter diversus; Proteus mirabilis; and Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. were less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It was two- to eightfold less active than cefixime but was markedly superior to cefaclor, cephalexin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole. R-3746 inhibited 50% of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella spp., Providencia spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Serratia marcescens at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml. Pseudomonas spp. were resistant. Fifty percent of Clostridium spp. were inhibited by 0.5 micrograms/ml, but MICs for Bacteroides spp. were greater than 128 micrograms/ml. R-3746 was not appreciably hydrolyzed by most chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases.
TI  - Activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone, in vitro and in experimental cystitis  and pyelonephritis in rats.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of E-3846, a new fluoroquinolone carboxylic acid derivative with a pyrrol ring substituent at position 7, was evaluated in comparison with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-3846 was more active than the reference quinolones against Staphylococcus species, including methicillin-resistant strains. E-3846 was similar to ciprofloxacin and more active than norfloxacin against Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis. In general, E-3846 was more active than norfloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, but less active than ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs giving 90% inhibition for E-3846, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were 2, 1, and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. The activity of E-3846 increased at acid pH; in contrast, acid pH caused a pronounced decrease in the activity of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. In vivo, E-3846 demonstrated excellent therapeutic efficacy in treating experimental S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cystitis and pyelonephritis in rats.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria by Purogene.
AB  - The bacteriocidal efficacy of Purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. The organisms tested were: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Group A, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus subtilis. The test organisms responded differently to inactivation by Purogene. At least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when Purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. Since Purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of ClO2 in this solution. This was done by varying the pH of Purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (pH of Purogene is 8.6) while keeping the pH of the experimental medium constant (pH 7.0). The results showed that Purogene was most efficacious at the lowest pH tested (pH 3.5). This indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at pH 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide as the active disinfecting species.
TI  - [Kinetics of ofloxacin-amoxicillin and ofloxacin-clavulanic acid combinations against pathogenic bacteria of the respiratory tract].
AB  - Ofloxacin exhibit a good activity against the pathogen bacteria of the respiratory tract, except for S. pneumoniae. Its use is interesting because it has a good diffusion into respiratory tissues. However, the combination with an another antibiotic was necessary to spread the activity spectrum and to prevent the resistant variants. By the new killing curve checkerboard method, these 2 combinations are studied against 8 strains: 4 H. influenzae (2 beta-lactamase producers), 2 S. pneumoniae and 2 K. pneumoniae, at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hours, a viable bacteria counting is executed by a microdilution method and is subcultured with a Steers-type multiple inoculator. With K. pneumoniae, ofloxacin has a dose dependent bactericidal activity which is maximum at 1 mg/l, While augmentin has a time-dependent activity. In the combination the synergy is rare. With H. influenzae, the results are the same; the bactericidal activity is less rapid but it is better than the ones with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. With S. pneumoniae, the 2 antibiotics have the same activity. No antagonism is observed. And the antibiotic which has a better bactericidal activity determine the viable bacteria count.
TI  - Bacterial species-dependent inhibition of human granulocyte elastase.
AB  - Lung infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes the recruitment of many granulocytes (PMN) to the alveoli, but little damage to lung structure ensues, as opposed to infections with other bacterial species that induce a similar PMN response and cause lung damage. Elastase, a proteolytic enzyme of PMN, has been implicated as an agent of lung injury. We studied the interaction of different bacterial species with human PMN in vitro to determine if PMN elastase activity is affected by the species of bacteria ingested. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae were grown, opsonized, and incubated with human PMN. After 1 h of incubation, intracellular and extracellular elastase activity was measured. S. pneumoniae reduced PMN elastase activity by 48%, whereas the other 3 species tested had only minimal effects on elastase activity. Loss of elastase activity occurred with S. pneumoniae: PMN ratios as low as 2:1. Adherence or ingestion of bacteria by the PMN was necessary for the decrease in elastase activity to occur; interventions that decreased phagocytosis, such as not opsonizing the bacteria, pretreatment of the PMN with cytochalasin B, and separation of bacteria from PMN by 0.22-mu filters, increased elastase activity. ELISA and Western blot analysis of elastase levels in these experiments suggested that normal amounts of elastase were present. Thus, the loss of elastase activity we observed may be due to an elastase inhibitor present in S. pneumoniae.

TI  - A survey of clinical experience with ciprofloxacin, a new quinolone antimicrobial.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a new quinolone antimicrobial agent with activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The efficacy and safety results of 80 clinical studies of the oral form of ciprofloxacin are reported. Drug safety was assessed in 2236 courses in 2203 adult patients treated primarily in the United States. Data from 1676 courses were suitable for analysis of drug efficacy. The unit dose for most patients ranged from 250 mg to 750 mg (median, 500 mg), usually given every 12 hours. The duration of treatment ranged from 3 to 231 days (median, 10 days). Predominant among 1722 infections were those of the urinary tract (43%), skin structures (29%), and respiratory tract (19%); the remainder were bone and joint infections (5%), bacteremias (2%), and intra-abdominal (1%), gastrointestinal (1%), and pelvic infections (less than 1%). Signs and symptoms of infection resolved in 79% of all cases; a further 15% improved, and 5% failed to improve. Pathogens were eradicated in 89% of urinary tract infections and persisted in 5%; 80% of patients still had sterile urine at the 3-to 6-week follow-up. In 81% of nonurinary tract infections, pathogens were eradicated; they persisted in 11%, and superinfection occurred in less than 5%. After treatment, 89% of the 2253 causative organisms were eradicated and 2% were reduced to clinically insignificant counts; 8% persisted. Of 411 isolates of P. aeruginosa, 77% were eradicated, as were 97% of 421 Escherichia coli and 80% of 248 Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Also eradicated were 95% of 166 Klebsiella, 96% of 139 Proteus mirabilis, 100% of 20 other Proteus, 94% of 123 Enterobacter, 100% of 68 Haemophilus influenzae, 96% of 49 Citrobacter, 89% of 45 Serratia, 95% of 41 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 91% of 43 Salmonella, 100% of 38 Morganella morganii, and 100% of 35 Providencia isolates. Adverse reactions were judged probably or possibly drug-related in 14.8% of courses; drug treatment had to be stopped prematurely in 3.5%. The most frequent reactions were gastrointestinal complaints (chiefly nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), metabolic disorders (elevated SGOT, SGPT, serum creatinine, or blood urea nitrogen), and nervous system effects (dizziness, light-headedness, restlessness, tremor, and headache). Crystalluria, judged to be related to ciprofloxacin, occurred in two patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of ceftriaxone in the treatment of neonatal infections].
AB  - Ceftriaxone (CTRX) was administered to the newborn and its clinical effectiveness as well as its blood and cerebrospinal fluid levels were studied. 1. Average blood levels of CTRX 1 hour after single intravenous administration were 39 micrograms/ml in 2 cases receiving about 10 mg/kg, 70 micrograms/ml in 2 other cases receiving 20 mg/kg and 208 micrograms/ml in one receiving 52.6 mg/kg. As is apparent from these cases data, blood levels of CTRX were dose dependent. Blood levels of the drug were between 3.7 to 12.4 micrograms/ml 24 hours later. Half-lives of the drug in blood in the 5 newborns ranged from 7.13 to 10.6 hours. In a 53-day-old patient receiving 43.4 mg/kg of CTRX via intravenous injection, the one-hour blood level of the drug was 140 micrograms/ml and the half-life was 3.68 hours. The blood level of the drug 36 hours after single intravenous administration with 17.3 to 20.0 micrograms/ml to 5 other cases 0 to 5 days of age ranged from 4.6 to 13.7 micrograms/ml. 2. The cerebrospinal fluid level of CTRX 4 hours after intravenous administration with 49.6 mg/kg to cases of Escherichia coli meningitis was 9.7 micrograms/ml on the first day following the start of the treatment. It increased to 23.6, 25.2 and 31.0 micrograms/ml on the third, fourth and fifth days, respectively, and then gradually decreased. Cerebrospinal level was still 5.8 micrograms/ml on the 22nd day during the recovery period. These levels were far more than 1,000 times as much as the MIC for the pathogen at the highest level, and more than 100 times even at the lowest level. 3. CTRX was administered via intravenous injection once or twice a day (11.0-39.5 mg/kg in total) to 13 newborns and 3 infants. The efficacy of CTRX was good to excellent in 10 cases for treatment of 11 diseases (sepsis 1, pneumonia 4, urinary tract infection 4 and fetal infection 2) and all the pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae 1, E. coli 3, Klebsiella pneumoniae 2, Citrobacter diversus 1) disappeared. In 6 cases where CTRX was used prophylactically, infection did not occur at all. The efficacy was excellent in another newborn with E. coli meningitis intravenously receiving 49.6 mg/kg of CTRX twice daily for 25 days. 4. No adverse reactions were observed. Mild eosinophilia was observed in 4 cases. Follow-up examinations of 3 of the 4 cases showed that these abnormal levels were returned to normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Enoxacin: in-vitro and animal evaluation as a parenteral and oral agent against hospital bacterial isolates.
AB  - Enoxacin was evaluated in in-vitro tests and in studies of effectiveness and blood concentrations in the mouse. Enoxacin was active against both susceptible and multiresistant hospital isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and staphylococci. Less susceptible were streptococci and anaerobes. Of nine quinolones tested, only norfloxacin was equivalent in vitro. The MBCs of enoxacin were one- to twofold greater than the MICs, and enoxacin was rapidly bactericidal. No single-step resistant mutants could be detected at 10 mg/l against large inocula and six to 11 steps were required for selection of resistant clones. In systemic mouse infections, enoxacin was effective in a single oral or subcutaneous dose against one strain each of Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri and Ps. aeruginosa, and two Staphylococcus aureus strains. Single oral and subcutaneous enoxacin doses (50 mg/kg) gave peak mouse blood levels of 4.9 and 9.5 mg/l and an elimination half-life of 1.8 h.
TI  - In vivo postantibiotic effect in a thigh infection in neutropenic mice.
AB  - The postantibiotic effect (PAE) is the suppression of bacterial growth that persists after limited exposure of organisms to antimicrobial agents. We demonstrated and standardized the in vivo PAE in a thigh infection model in neutropenic mice. Inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.4-7.5 h against aerobic gram-negative bacilli, whereas beta-lactam antibiotics did not induce significant PAEs. Against aerobic gram-positive cocci, cell wall-active agents and inhibitors of protein and nucleic acid synthesis induced PAEs of 1.2-7.1 h, except for penicillins, which did not induce PAEs against streptococci. With few exceptions the in vivo PAE correlated well with the PAE reported in prior in vitro studies. Residual drug in thigh tissue did not cause the PAE. Theoretically, the presence of a PAE may allow antimicrobial agents to be given more intermittently without organism regrowth after drug levels fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - Collaborated studies on species of respiratory tract infection (RTI)-related organisms for their identification and drug susceptibilities have been carried out since 1981 at about 20 centers in Japan. On this occasion, the data obtained between 1982 and 1985 were reanalyzed to determine whether or not drug susceptibilities differed depending upon diseases, from which the organisms were isolated. The results summarized below were obtained in this study. 1. Among Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa examined, differences in drug susceptibilities according to different diseases were found among S. aureus and also mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa. 2. Susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics was definitely lower in S. aureus strains isolated from pneumonia than in those isolated from chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasia. 3. The isolation frequency of methicillin-and cefazolin-resistant strains of S. aureus was 30.3% and 25.9%, respectively, and was especially high among strains isolated from pneumonia. The antibiotic potency of minocycline against S. aureus, including methicillin resistant S. aureus, was the strongest among 9 drugs examined; S. aureus maintained relatively sufficient sensitivity to dicloxacillin among beta-lactam antibiotics. 4. Mucoid producing strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from chronic bronchitis had slightly lower drug susceptibility than those isolated from bronchiectasia. 5. When drug susceptibilities of H. influenzae were compared among groups separated according to diseases using MIC50, MIC80 and MIC90 as indicators, there were no clear differences. The isolation frequency of ampicillin (ABPC)-resistant strains, however, was clearly different among diseases; namely, resistant strains were the most and the least frequently isolated from chronic bronchitis and from pneumonia, respectively. In addition, the drug susceptibility of H. influenzae isolated in 1985 was analyzed in relation to the production of beta-lactamase. As a result, it was suspected that some factors, other than beta-lactamase, participated in the mechanism of ABPC-resistance. 6. These results suggest that drugs to be used for the chemotherapy of RTI should be selected considering the fact that drug susceptibilities of the pathogens differ, even among the same species, according to diseases.
TI  - Growth responses of environmental mastitis pathogens to long-chain fatty acids.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were tested for susceptibility to long-chain fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin. Antibacterial activity of free fatty acids on each bacterial species was measured after 12 h in synthetic media. Growth responses of all three strains of Streptococcus uberis were completely inhibited by C18:3 and those of two of three strains by C18:2 at 1 micrograms/ml. None of the fatty acids tested were bactericidal to Streptococcus faecalis. Saturated fatty acids C14 and C16 were more bacteriostatic to Streptococcus faecalis than were polyene fatty acids. Growth responses of coliform species were not affected by long-chain fatty acids. In general, environmental mastitis pathogens were resistant to fatty acids predominant in teat canal keratin.
TI  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  - Tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. At less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus spp., Providencia spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. At less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited Haemophilus spp., Neisseria spp., and Branhamella catarrhalis. It did not inhibit Pseudomonas spp. or Acinetobacter spp. Tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family Enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Some Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. The MIC for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, and C and for Streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for 90% of enterococci, Listeria spp., Bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as TEM-1 and SHV-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of Enterobacter, Morganella, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides spp. Tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of E. cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. The growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the MICs and MBCs.
TI  - Management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients.
AB  - Broviac catheters are commonly used to provide parenteral nutrition and access for infusion of blood products and drugs to pediatric patients. Sepsis is the most common serious complication of continued catheter use. Although removal of the catheter is generally recommended when it becomes contaminated, it may not be feasible to do so without compromising patient care. We evaluated the management of catheter-related infections in pediatric patients with and without removal of catheter. Seventy-seven episodes of catheter sepsis were evaluated in 61 pediatric patients; 24 were neonates and 37 were older children. The catheters were used for multiple purposes in 75% of cases. The most common microorganisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 26%, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 9%, and Streptococcus viridans in 8% of cases; other pathogens included group D Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in four older children. Thirty-five patients were treated with antibiotics without catheter removal. Thirty patients received appropriate antibiotic therapy based on the susceptibility data. Twenty-six of these 30 patients responded within 5 days of therapy whereas the others required 15-39 days of treatment. Lack of response was mainly associated with the presence of abscess, immunocompromised status, and organisms P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Based on the sensitivity and minimum inhibitory concentration data, a combined regimen of gentamicin and vancomycin would be an effective initial therapy. These findings suggest that (1) catheter sepsis can be managed with appropriate antibiotics, and (2) when continued use of Broviac catheter is desired, a trial of antibiotic therapy should be attempted before catheter removal.
TI  - Induction of murine B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin synthesis by some bacterial ribosomes.
AB  - Ribosomal preparations from Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were investigated with respect to their activating capacity towards murine lymphoid cells. The proliferation of BALB/c spleen cells was induced in a dose-dependent fashion (from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) by ribosomes of K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes with a peak activity at 48 or 72 hr of culture. The majority of the blast cells induced by these ribosomal preparations were positive for surface-immunoglobulin (S-Ig) and negative for Thy 1.2. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and S. pyogenes ribosomes induced the synthesis of IgM and some IgA. Cell proliferation and induction of IgM production were also demonstrated with the 3 ribosomal preparations using spleen cells from athymic nude (nu+/nu+) mice, Lyb-5-defective CBA/N spleen cells, B cell-enriched and T cell-depleted BALB/c spleen cell suspensions, as well as spleen cells from the Ips gene-deficient C3H/HeJ strain. Cell culture supernatants contained specific anti-ribosome IgM antibodies. Antibodies of other specificities (anti-sheep erythrocytes) were also demonstrated in supernatants from K. pneumoniae-stimulated cultures. Evidence against a possible role of contamination of K. pneumoniae and H. influenzae ribosomes by lipopolysaccharide- or lipid A-associated proteins in this effect is discussed. Ribosomes from S. pneumoniae did not induce 3H-thymidine incorporation nor Ig production. None of the 4 ribosomal preparations was found to stimulate T cell blastogenesis or to induce interleukin-2 production by naive BALB/c spleen cells. Finally, ribosomes from H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae but not those of K. pneumoniae stimulated interleukin-1 production by adherent spleen cells, from BALB/c mice.
TI  - BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin: antimicrobial activity against nearly 7,000  recent clinical isolates, comparative potency with other oral agents, and activity against beta-lactamase producing isolates.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of BMY-28100 was tested against approximately 7,000 bacterial pathogens in a multicenter, multiphased collaborative investigation. The BMY-28100 spectrum and antimicrobial potency was most similar to that of cefaclor and superior to that of cephalexin among currently available cephalosporins. Species that had greater than or equal to 90% of clinical strains inhibited by BMY-28100 (less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml) were: Citrobacter diversus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, N. meningitidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus supp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. bovis, serogroup C and G streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes and gm-positive anaerobes. BMY-28100 inhibited 9% more of the 6286 fresh clinical isolates at less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml than cefaclor at the same concentration. BMY-28100 was generally bactericidal, but MICs for some species were markedly increased when an inoculum concentration of 10(7) CFU/ml was used. Strains producing plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases (TEM, OXA, SHV, HMS) were susceptible to BMY-28100, cefaclor, and cefuroxime. BMY-28100 was less active against strains producing chromosomal-mediated beta-lactamases (Types I and IV). BMY-28100 was not hydrolyzed significantly by the tested plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was destroyed by Type I cephalosporinases and Klebsiella K1 enzymes.
TI  - Bacteriological and clinical evaluation of cefotetan in the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - The authors studied 302 hospitalized patients, 164 males and 138 females aged 15-88 years (average 66 years), with severe infections. Cefotetan was administered to 278 of them at the dose of 1 or 2 g, b.i.d. or a single daily dose i.m. Other patients [24] were treated with a continuous intravenous infusion of cefotetan (3 g daily in 5% dextrose). Of these patients 121 were treated for urinary tract infections (UTI); 114 for respiratory tract infections (RTI); 41 for liver biliary duct infections (BDI); 17 for skin or skin structure infections (SKI); 6 for fever of unknown origin and 3 for sepsis. The following Gram-positive organisms [156] were isolated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus group D; and the following Gram-negative organisms [122]: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia spp., Klebsiella spp., Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The overall eradication rate for Gram-positive organisms was 74% and for Gram-negative organisms it was 88%. The clinical response was satisfactory in 87.7% of patients (specifically, cefotetan was effective in 90% of UTI, 84.2% of RTI, 97.5% of BDI and 82.3% of SKI). The drug was well tolerated and side-effects (such as skin rash, diarrhoea, purpura and pain at the site of injection) occurred in only 4% of patients treated with cefotetan. In conclusion, cefotetan appears to be safe and highly effective for the treatment of severe infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Evaluation of a latex kit reagent for the detection and identification of pneumococci.
AB  - The ability of a commercial latex kit to detect pneumococcal antigen in 50 CSF samples, 150 ear swabs and 80 sputum samples was investigated. Results were compared with microscopic and culture findings. 18/19 culture-positive specimens were latex-positive. 7 latex-positive specimens yielded organisms other than S. pneumoniae which agglutinated the latex, 4 Klebsiella spp, 2 Staphylococcus aureus and 1 Haemophilus influenzae. For 11 other specimens latex agglutination was positive and culture negative. S. pneumoniae was recovered from the blood of 1 of these patients and, in 2 further cases, microscopy showed poorly stained organisms which had some resemblance to S. pneumoniae. For 10 different strains of S. pneumoniae suspensions containing between 10(4) and 10(7) organisms per ml were required to agglutinate the latex.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [The use of UV rays for the disinfection of water. I. Microbiologic studies of drinking water].
AB  - As a physical disinfection method without chemicals required the ultraviolet irradiation was tested for disinfection of drinking water. The survival was measured as a function of exposure to radiation for S. enteritidis, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, E. coli, K. pneumoniae und S. faecium. The bacteria were grown in trypton soya broth until they were well into the exponential phase. Two different UV-disinfection units were tested. Both consist of cylindrical shaped chambers with one low-pressure mercury-discharge lamp with their longitudinal axis parallel to the chambers. With 10(6) cfu/ml the experiments were done with three different rates of flow of 7,2 m3/h, 4,0 m3/h and 2,0 m3/h. The minimum exposures to radiation necessary to cause a 99.999% reduction were 10-86 mWs/cm2 depending on the test bacterium and on the UV-disinfection unit. The minimum doses ranged for S. enteritidis up to 13 mWs/cm2, for E. coli up to 21 mWs/cm2, for K. pneumoniae up to 39 mWs/cm2, for S. faecium up to 42 mWs/cm2, for E. cloacae up to 43 mWs/cm2, for C. freundii up to 72 mWs/cm2, and for S. marcescens up to 86 mWs/cm2.
TI  - Sterility testing of home and inpatient parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - The microbial contamination rate was compared for parenteral nutrition solutions  prepared by patients for home use and by pharmacy personnel for inpatient use. Phase I validated the Ivex 0.22-micron inline filter as a tool for microbiological testing by inoculating small numbers of organisms in 5% dextrose injection and testing for recovery. Phase II validated the same method for determining microbial contamination of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions. Phase III compared inpatient and home TPN microbial contamination rates using the methodology validated in phase II. Test organism inocula used in phase I and II were Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. All contaminated solutions in phase I showed visual turbidity within 48 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. All phase II-contaminated TPN solutions showed visual turbidity after 96 hr, and all test organisms were recovered and identified. One hundred postinfusion TPN samples were collected randomly during phase III from inpatient parenteral nutrition patients. Six patients and two hospitals participated in the study. None of the 44 home parenteral nutrition samples and none of the 56 inpatient TPN samples developed visible turbidity. Subcultures of each sample on blood agar were negative for microbial growth. This described methodology offers an effective means to establish contamination rates of parenteral nutrition solutions after administration.
TI  - Bactericidal effect of ceftriaxone versus imipenem plus cilastatin in bronchial secretion.
AB  - The bactericidal quotient (BQ) assessed in the site of infection represents an essential parameter for evaluating the real bactericidal potency of an antibiotic in vivo. The assessment and knowledge of BQ values allow us to set up a more accurate and appropriate antibacterial therapy. The two drugs--ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and imipenem plus cilastatin (Tienam)--that have been taken into consideration in this study, having a similar antibacterial spectrum though with different kinetics, may have the same BQ values in bronchial secretion versus Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, when administered at different dosages, i.e. ceftriaxone 1 g (i.v.) every 24 h, imipenem 0.5 g (i.v.) every 8 h.
TI  - Multiple subdural abscesses following colonic perforation--a rare complication of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
AB  - A case of colonic perforation by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, its subsequent migration and protrusion from the anal orifice is reported. The shunt reservoir and ventricular catheter were removed percutaneously, and the disconnected peritoneal catheter was pulled out through the anus. Blood culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus fecalis. CT scan showed multiple subdural abscesses with evidence of ventriculitis. Removal of the shunt (as described), evacuation of subdural pus and systemic antibiotics resulted in complete recovery.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment.
AB  - Pneumonia is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. A variety of conditions that damage the airways and weaken host defense mechanisms increase the susceptibility of the individual to bacterial colonization of the pulmonary tree. Because the clinician frequently cannot determine the etiologic agent, pneumonia is often treated empirically. Cefonicid, a long-acting cephalosporin, is a useful and cost-effective antibiotic that is active against many of the common pathogens that cause community-acquired pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. It is also active against less common community-acquired pathogens, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and some anaerobic mouth flora. Erythromycin is useful when Mycoplasma or Legionella species are suspected. Cefonicid's demonstrated safety and efficacy, its low cost, and its long half-life, permitting once-daily dosing, make this antibiotic an ideal parenteral choice for empiric therapy of community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Immunoglobulin secretion of mononuclear cells induced by various mitogens.
AB  - Immunosufficiency can be evaluated by Ig secretion subsequent to mitogenic stimulation of human mononuclear cells (MNC). It seems that there are significant differences in immunoglobulin class secreted by these cells when stimulated with various polyclonal activators. The aim of the current study was to analyse these differences. MNC cells was randomly obtained from nine healthy blood donors and were activated by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), group-A streptococcus (A-ScM), Staphylococcus aureus (SAC), Klebsiella pneumonia (Kleb-M) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Significantly increased levels of IgM were recorded after a 7 day incubation followed by stimulation with Kleb-M (6.2 +/- 2.9) and EBV (5.9 +/- 4.5) compared to inactivated MNC (1.6 +/- 1.4), and following 10 days incubation then stimulation by EBV (13.4 +/- 5.5) and Kleb-M (9.9 +/- 4.2) compared to unstimulated cells (2.9 +/- 1.8). Significantly greater IgG levels were achieved following incubation with EBV (3.0 +/- 4.0) and PWM (2.4 +/- 1.3) after 7 days (vs 0.6 +/- 0.4 in unstimulated cells) and by PWM (11.7 +/- 5.3) and Kleb-M (8.8 +/- 3.9, vs 2.3 +/- 2.2) after 10 days. The present data emphasize the significance of merging both mitogen selection and culture duration for acquiring information and high fidelity results of immunoglobulin secretion by polyclonal activators.
TI  - Bacterial lysis of fibrin seal in vitro.
AB  - We performed an in vitro study to determine whether certain bacteria may lyse a commercially available fibrin seal (Beriplast, Behringwerke, Marburg, FRG). Fibrinogen solution was mixed with actively growing bacterial cultures, and thrombin was added. During 20 days of incubation at 37 degrees C complete lysis was observed with a number of different bacteria, however, at different rates. Complete lysis within 1-5 days was observed for the following species (number of strains in parentheses): Streptococcus faecalis (3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2), Serratia marcescens (2), and Serratia liquefaciens (1). Lysis was observed after 6-10 days for Enterobacter cloacae (2), Morganella morganii (2), Escherichia coli (2), S. marcescens (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2). Lysis after 11-16 days was observed for Streptococcus pyogenes (2), S. faecalis (2), and Staphylococcus aureus (2). Rapid lysis was associated with the ability of the strain to liquefy gelatin, i.e. the production of a protease.
TI  - Inhibition of human neutrophil elastase by bacterial polyanions.
AB  - We previously demonstrated that pneumococcal extracts contain a highly specific inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase (HNE). We now show that the active inhibitor in these extracts is a high-molecular-weight, heat-stable substance that appears to be RNA, since inhibitory activity of pneumococcal extracts is decreased by incubation with ribonuclease but not by incubation with deoxyribonuclease or proteinase K. Moreover, metabolically labeled ([3H]uridine) pneumococcal RNA, isolated by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, strongly inhibits HNE. Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, although polyanionic, is only weakly inhibitory toward HNE and is not a major source of elastase-inhibitory activity in pneumococcal extracts. On the other hand, the capsule of Haemophilus influenzae type b contains polyribosylribitol phosphate. This highly charged polyanion possesses HNE-inhibitory activity, but only under special circumstances to be discussed below. Pneumococci (type I, type II smooth, type II rough) and H. influenzae (type b) all release HNE-inhibitory activity into their culture medium during growth. By contrast, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus release little (if any) stable HNE-inhibitory activity during growth. We propose that some bacterial pneumonias may spare host tissue because polyanions released by the invading microorganisms (e.g. RNA from autolysing pneumococci) inhibit elastase released from inflammatory neutrophils and thereby modulate accompanying tissue proteolysis. Pneumonias caused by microorganisms that do not release stable polyanionic inhibitors of HNE (e.g., Staphylococcus and Klebsiella) may be correspondingly more injurious to the lung.
TI  - Effects of inhalation of ethylene dichloride on pulmonary defenses of mice and rats.
AB  - The effects of single or multiple inhalation exposures to ethylene dichloride (DCE) on the pulmonary defense systems of mice and rats were evaluated. Single exposures of mice to the threshold limit value of DCE (10 ppm) resulted in decreased pulmonary bactericidal activity to inhaled Klebsiella pneumoniae and increased mortality from Streptococcus zooepidemicus respiratory infection. A single exposure to 5 ppm DCE caused increased mortality from streptococcal pneumonia although bactericidal activity was not affected. Neither of these two parameters changed following single or five consecutive daily exposures to 2.5 ppm DCE. Single exposures to 10 or 100 ppm DCE did not affect mouse alveolar macrophage (AM) inhibition of the proliferation of a tumor target cell in vitro or AM in vitro phagocytosis of red blood cells. In rats, no effects were observed on pulmonary bactericidal activity. AM in vitro phagocytosis, AM cytostasis and cytolysis of tumor target cells, AM ectoenzymes, or blastogenesis of mitogen-stimulated rat T- and B-lymphocytes from lung-associated, mesenteric, and popliteal lymph nodes following single exposure to 100 or 200 ppm DCE or after twelve 5-hr exposures to 10, 20, 50, or 100 ppm DCE.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new broad spectrum, beta-lactamase-stable oral cephalosporin, cefixime.
AB  - Cefixime is a new orally absorbed iminomethoxy, aminothiazolyl cephalosporin. It  inhibits the majority, 90%, of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae at concentrations less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It inhibits 90% of the other members of the Enterobacteriaceae at concentrations less than 1 microgram/ml, with the exception of some strains of Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Morganella morganii, Cefixime does not inhibit enterococci, Listeria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Bacteroides spp. or staphylococci. In general, cefixime has in vitro activity superior to cephalexin, cephradine, cefadroxil and cefaclor against all bacteria with the exception of staphylococci. Cefixime is not destroyed by most of the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases and its activity is not reduced by serum, blood or urine. Cefixime overall has excellent in vitro activity against the commonly encountered respiratory and urinary tract pathogens.
TI  - [Clinical studies on flomoxef in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Flomoxef (FMOX, 6315-S) is a new oxacephem with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. We used FMOX for treatment of 13 patients with respiratory tract infections including 4 cases of pneumonia, 5 of lung abscess and 4 of exacerbation of the chronic airway diseases. FMOX showed excellent in vitro antimicrobial activities against clinical isolates including 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and each one strain of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Clinical responses were excellent in 3 cases, good in 7 and fair or poor in 3. No side effect was observed, but abnormal laboratory findings caused by FMOX administration were found in 2 cases; hypertransaminasemia and eosinophilia. However, neither of them was severe. From the above results, it is considered that FMOX will be useful for treatment of patients with respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the two new oral cephalosporin metabolites RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074.
AB  - A total of 629 clinical strains of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were  tested for their susceptibility to RO 19-5247, RO 15-8074, and other antimicrobial agents. Both RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had good activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae; however, resistance was found among some strains of Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Klebsiella and Morganella spp. Both compounds showed moderate to poor active against Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. Against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococci (not enterococci), each compound was highly active in vitro. RO 19-5247 and RO 15-8074 had comparable activity to cotrimoxazole, ceftazidime and ceftizoxime. Each new compound had considerably better activity then did cefaclor and amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate.
TI  - Bacterial capsular polysaccharides--biochemistry, immunity and vaccine.
AB  - The biochemical basis of immunogenicity to bacterial capsular polysaccharides (PSs) has been extensively studied. Antibody responses to PS antigens can be greatly affected by their physico-chemical properties, e.g. molecular size, specific determinants, conformation etc. At present, three bacterial PS vaccines, including meningococcal, pneumococcal, and H. influenzae type b, have been licensed in the U.S.A. Many other PSs, such as group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella, are still in various stages of vaccine development. Studies on the type distribution of pneumococcal isolates from Asian populations showed that the types included in the 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine were considerably fewer in Asia than that observed in the U.S.A.: the proportion of types was 62.9% in Taiwan, 72.9% in Japan and 87.9-92.8% in the U.S.A. A large number of pneumococcal types found in Taiwan and Japan, such as 15A, 23A, 24F and 34, are not present in the pneumococcal vaccine. Immunization with one type of group 9 or 19F PS induced a poor antibody response to the other type. All 9N, 9V, 19F and 19A PSs are required in the vaccine to induce sufficient antibodies against group 9 and 19 infection. Extensive cross-reactions have been found between pneumococcal PSs and PSs from other bacteria. Klebsiella K2 PS could enhance the magnitude of the antibody response to 19F PS. The structure of streptococcal 14636/74 was found to be identical to pneumococcal 19F PS. A difficult problem in the development of vaccines against bacterial diseases is the poor immune response of young children to purified PSs. Antibodies against the PSs can be elicited when PS antigens are conjugated to a protein carrier. In mice, the maternal immunization with pneumococcal PS during pregnancy or before mating, did not cause suppression or other observable harmful effect, rather it may provide sufficient antibodies for protection against infection during early life.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber.
AB  - Tertiary amine was covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber and examined for antibacterial activity. The tertiary amine covalently bonded to a polystyrene fiber (TAF) showed a high antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. TAF exhibited a stronger antibacterial activity against gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Serratia marcescens) than against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis) or Candida albicans. This activity against E. coli was accentuated by 0.1% deoxycholate or 10 mg of actinomycin D per ml, to which E. coli is normally not susceptible. This implies that TAF causes an increase of the bacterial outer membrane permeability. On the other hand, the antimicrobial activity was inhibited by adding Mg2+ or by lowering the pH. This suggest an electrostatic interaction between the bacterial cell wall and TAF. Scanning electron microscopy showed that E. coli cells were initially attached to TAF, with many projections on the cell surface, but then were apparently lysed after contact for 4 h. Taken together, these results imply that bacteria initially interact with TAF by an electrostatic force between the anionic bacterial outer membrane and the cationic tertiary amine residues of TAF and that longer contact with TAF damages the bacterial outer membrane structure and increases its permeability.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from the patients with lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1985)].
AB  - It has been more than 4 years since third-generation cephems were introduced into clinical practice. The range of our drug selection definitely tends to increase, because we today have more antibiotics with wider spectrum, antibiotics with strong activities only against Gram-negative strains, such as monobactams, and those with tremendously high activities such as quinolone carboxylic acid derivatives, in comparison to those we had in the past. Among isolates obtained mainly from sputa of 567 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 16 institutions throughout Japan between September of 1985 and March of 1986, 741 strains were determined to be causative organisms. MIC's of various antimicrobial agents were determined against 67 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 100 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 199 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 92 strains of non-mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 40 strains of mucoid P. aeruginosa, 29 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 strains of Escherichia coli and for 42 strains of Branhamella catarrhalis out of the above 741 strains to determine their drug sensitivities. As for types of lower respiratory tract infections found in 1981--1983, 57.9--64.5% of the infections were chronic respiratory infections; i.e., chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis and bronchiectasis. These chronic infections, including diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB), were found in 63.1% of lower respiratory tract infections in 1984. Their incidence dropped to 54.0% in 1985, even though DPB was included; i.e., the incidence of chronic bronchiolitis was 5.5%, that of DPB was 7.1%, and that of bronchial asthma associated with lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was 8.8% which was twice as much as that found in 1981--1984. Although bacterial pneumonia was found in 24.8% of all the cases in 1981, its incidence was reduced to 11.0% in 1983, 15.1% in 1984, and 17.6% in 1985. This reduction seemed to have resulted from gradual decreases in the occurrence of bacterial pneumonia among the young population. As with usual years, a high incidence rate in a total lower respiratory tract infections in 1985 was found among older patients; namely, 73.5% was at the age of 50 or over (417/567). Next, we determined relationships between clinical isolates and isolates from respiratory infections, including chronic bronchitis, chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and DPB. H. influenzae was isolated from 50.5% of patients with these infections in 1981; however, the detection rate decreased by about 20% to 29.7% in 1985. P. aeruginosa was consistently isolated, between 24.1% and 30.4% every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Deletion analysis of sucrose metabolic genes from a Salmonella plasmid cloned in  Escherichia coli K12.
AB  - The sucrose operon from pUR400, a 78-kbp conjugative Salmonella plasmid, was cloned in Escherichia coli K12. The operon was located in a 5.7-kbp SalI restriction fragment and was subcloned, in each of two possible orientations, using the expression vector pUC18. The insert DNA was restriction mapped and duplicate restriction sites in the insert and in the polylinker of the vector were used to create various deletions promoter distal in the operon sequence. Additional deletions were made with the restriction exonuclease Bal31. Cells containing hybrid plasmids with specified deletions lacked the ability to transport sucrose or were constitutive for hydrolase and/or uptake activities. The scrA (enzyme IIScr) and scrR (regulatory) genes resided within 2900-bp SmaI-SalI DNA fragment and were assigned the order scrB, scrA, scrR. An amplified sucrose-inducible gene product, Mr 68,000, was detected only in the membrane fraction from recombinant cells that contained plasmid with the intact operon sequence. This protein represented 11% of the total membrane protein and was resistant to extraction with 0.5 M sodium chloride, 2% Triton X-100, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. The protein did not appear to be the product of either the scrA, scrB, or scrR gene and may therefore represent a previously unidentified membrane-bound sucrose protein. A new gene, scrC, is proposed. In addition, the cloned 5.7-kbp SalI and 2.5-kbp SmaI-SalI DNA fragments failed to hybridize to chromosomal DNA from Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus lactis, Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus acidophilus as well as to DNA from a sucrose plasmid from Salmonella tennessee. However, the probes showed weak homology with a 20-kbp EcoRI restriction fragment from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluations of BMY-28100, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - A new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100, was evaluated for in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities in comparison with cefaclor and cephalexin. BMY-28100 showed in vitro activity 3- and 10-fold more potent than that of cefaclor against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. BMY-28100 was slightly better than cefaclor and about 4 times more active than cephalexin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis were comparably susceptible to BMY-28100 and cefaclor. The bactericidal activity of BMY-28100 against S. aureus, E. coli and P. mirabilis was equal to or twice as high as MIC value, which was similar to that of cefaclor. The stability of BMY-28100 against penicillinases was nearly comparable to that of cefaclor, whereas cefaclor was somewhat unstable to cephalosporinases. BMY-28100 was about twice as active as cefaclor against three Gram-positive bacterial infections. BMY-28100 was also more potent against infections of H. influenzae and P. mirabilis, but slightly less active against E. coli Juhl than cefaclor. Blood level parameters of BMY-28100 were significantly superior to those of cefaclor and slightly better than cephalexin in mice and rats. The urinary recovery of BMY-28100 was somewhat higher and comparable to that of cefaclor and cephalexin, respectively. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor in human and calf sera at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Bacteremia in adult men.
AB  - A prospective study was done to characterize positive blood cultures in adult male veterans. The research included 277 patients over a 15-month period. There were 348 organisms isolated, of which 65 percent were pathogens, 6 percent probable pathogens, 4 percent probable contaminants, and 25 percent contaminants. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (23 percent), Escherichia coli (12 percent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10 percent), Staphylococcus aureus (9 percent), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 percent), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 percent). The number of positive blood cultures was significantly greater for pathogens (mean 1.8 bottles) than contaminants (mean 1.2). Patients with pathogens were more likely to have hypotension than those with contaminants. At least 40 percent of all patients with a positive blood culture died within 14 days after their first positive culture. The vast majority of bacteremias were community acquired. As lungs and wounds comprised about one half of the sites of entry for the bacteremias, it appears that more emphasis should be placed on early diagnosis and efficient treatment of infections from these sites to reduce subsequent mortality.
TI  - [Ability to survive and interactions of selected bacterial species in activated carbon filters].
AB  - The survival and the interactions of selected, hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon filters was investigated. The numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. putida increased in previously sterilized filters. After inoculation all bacteria (10(6] were adsorbed. During a period of 6-10 days the filter effluent contained no detectable bacteria. After that the colony numbers increased to a constant level of 10(4)-10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml effluent and 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g activated carbon. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis died off in the filter system. If the filters were inoculated simultaneously with two species, P. putida and P. aeruginosa remained at a constant level between 10(4) and 10(5) CFU/ml. E. coli was suppressed by P. aeruginosa and died off in the presence of P. putida. As in-vitro tests indicated, P. putida did not produce inhibitory substances against P. aeruginosa or E. coli. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa showed antagonistic activities against E. coli.
TI  - [The role of ofloxacin (Tarivid) therapy in respiratory and urinary tract infections].
AB  - In this study, 14 patients with urinary tract infection and 8 patients with respiratory tract infection were given 400 mg/day of ofloxacin. 12 of 14 patients with urinary tract infection and 4 of 8 patients with respiratory tract infection was cured and clinically improved. 12 of 13 E. coli isolates were eradicated with this treatment. No severe adverse reactions were observed. No in vitro resistance against ofloxacin was seen.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect in serum of patients with urinary tract infection receiving high-dose amikacin.
AB  - Ten patients received a 30-min infusion of amikacin (30 mg/kg) on day 1 and 15 mg/kg on day 2. Mean serum creatinine was 1.1 +/- 0.3 (standard deviation) mg/dl before and 1.0 +/- 0.3 mg/dl 3 days after the second infusion. Mean serum amikacin concentrations before, at the end of infusion, and 1, 6, 12, and 24 h after 30 and 15 mg/kg were 0, 157, 79, 31, 16, 5, 5, 85, 51, 19, 12, and 5 mg/liter, respectively. Five strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible and resistant to oxacillin, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, corynebacterium sp. strain JK, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium fortuitum (three strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested. Serum bactericidal activities (SBAs) were greater than or equal to 1:8 in greater than or equal to 80% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 30 mg/kg and in greater than or equal to 60% of the sera 1 and 6 h after 15 mg/kg against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptible to oxacillin, A. calcoaceticus, and K. pneumoniae. L. monocytogenes, Serratia marcescens, and P. aeruginosa had lower SBAs. Very low or no activity was observed against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and Streptococcus faecalis. The study of the killing rate in serum confirmed these results. Postantibiotic effect was studied by incubating a strain from each species in serum samples obtained 1 and 6 h after both regimens for 0.5, 1, or 2 h. The duration of postantibiotic effect depended on the duration of contact and the concentration of amikacin for the following organisms: oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, A. calcoaceticus, K. pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens. M. fortuitum was killed after 30 min of contact. No postantibiotic effect was observed with Streptococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium sp. strain JK, or oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Amikacin at 30 mg/kg provided high levels and SBAs against susceptible pathogens. Prolonged postantibiotic effects were observed. No signs of nephrotoxicity occurred.
TI  - The resistance of urinary tract pathogens to chlorhexidine bladder washouts.
AB  - Isolates of Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis from urinary-tract infections in spinally-injured patients together with Escherichia coli 10418 were challenged with chlorhexidine (200 mg l-1) in a model of a catheterized bladder under conditions which simulate the bladder washout technique. All species survived the antiseptic. Organisms growing on the wall of the bladder model appeared to be particularly resistant and electron microscopy showed that these cells were embedded in a protective glycocalyx. The effect of chlorhexidine bladder washouts on the bacterial flora in the urine of patients was also observed and shown to be minimal and temporary. Examination of urinary sediments from patients revealed the presence of micro-colonies of bacteria embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. We conclude that bladder washouts with chlorhexidine are not likely to eliminate established infections with organisms that occur in patients with indwelling bladder catheters.
TI  - [Treatment of post-traumatic and post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis with ceftriaxone alone or in combination with fosfomycin].
AB  - From 1984 to 1986, 13 patients (10 adults, 3 children) with bacterial meningitis  following neurosurgery or traumatism were given ceftriaxone alone 6 times at a dose of 40 mg/kg one IV injection per day, or in association 7 times with fosfomycin at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day, 3 IV perfusions every 4 h. The bacteriological diagnosis was confirmed in 9 cases (3 Staphylococcus aureus, 4 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 Klebsiella, 1 Peptococcus). In vitro neither synergy nor antagonism were observed between the two antimicrobial agents. The acute infections episode resolved in all patients except on who died with a negative CSF culture. One superinfection meningitis with Achromobacter was seen. CSF concentrations of ceftriaxone were assayed and found to be comparable with those reported by most authors. Tolerance was excellent for all our patients.
TI  - Bacterial interference by anaerobic species isolated from human feces.
AB  - Eighty-four anaerobic fecal isolates obtained from five healthy volunteers were tested for their ability to inhibit in vitro growth of eight species of Enterobacteriaceae, four species of faculative gram-positive cocci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-nine of the 84 anaerobic isolates (58%) inhibited the growth of at least one indicator bacterium. Isolates of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium spp. were most consistently inhibitory. Anaerobic cocci and clostridia were infrequently inhibitory; eubacteria showed no inhibitory activity. Serratia marcescens was the indicator most often inhibited; 54% of all anaerobic isolates tested, all of nine Bifidobacterium isolates and 33 of 43 Bacteroides isolates inhibited this organism. No anaerobes inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Citrobacter freundii, Citrobacter diversus or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Infections associated with transhepatic biliary drainage devices.
AB  - To determine the infectious complications associated with transhepatic biliary drainage devices, an analysis of the records of 38 patients who underwent placement of a pigtail catheter (n = 11), a Ring catheter/feeding tube (n = 13), or a Carey-Coons endoprosthesis (n = 15) was carried out. Nineteen infectious events occurred in 38 patients with 39 biliary devices. Infections consisted of bacteremia, cholangitis with and without documented bacteribilia, and intrahepatic abscesses and were frequently associated with obstruction (66.7 percent of infectious episodes). The most frequent organisms isolated from blood were Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the most frequent organisms isolated from bile were P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis. Trends for more frequent occurrence of neoplasms involving the gallbladder or biliary tract, recent surgical procedures and catheter manipulations in infected as compared with noninfected patients, and a delayed time to infection were noted in patients with an endoprosthesis.
TI  - [Treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic children by ceftazidime combined with netilmicin. Results of a multicenter study apropos of 88 cases].
AB  - Infection is the most important cause of mortality in leucopenic patients. A broad spectrum antibiotic therapy is imperative in febrile and neutropenic patients. In a multicentric study we have used ceftazidime (100 mg/kg/d) and netilmicin (6 mg/kg/d) in 88 children (fever greater than or equal to 38.5 degrees C, neutropenia less than 500/mm3) treated for acute leukemias (59), non Hodgkin lymphomas (13) or solid tumors (16). Median age was 7 years (2 months-16 years). In patients who continued to remain febrile, vancomycin (40 mg/kg/d) was added after 48 hours. The effective treatment was continued until a neutrophil count greater than 1,000/mm3. The first combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin) was effective in 64 children (73%) and the second combination (ceftazidime + netilmicin + vancomycin) in 11 patients. Bacteria were isolated in 39 children: Escherichia coli: 9, Staphylococcus epidermidis: 9, Staphylococcus aureus: 8, Streptococcus: 6, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae: 1, Haemophilus: 1, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 1, Proteus: 1, Serratia: 1, Flavobacterium: 1. In these 39 patients, 30 became apyretic with ceftazidime and netilmicin and 6 after vancomycin. All blood culture were negative after the first combination. The median duration of antibiotic therapy was 14 days (5-9 days: 28, 10-20 days: 43, greater than 20 days: 17). There were no death, no superinfection. Tolerance was good without kidney or liver or biological perturbation. We conclude that the combination ceftazidime and netilmicin is effective in neutropenic children.
TI  - Post-antibiotic suppressive effect of ciprofloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The post-antibiotic suppressive effect (PAE) of different antibacterial agents against gram-positive bacteria has been known since the 1940s. Recently, it has been demonstrated that quinolone antimicrobial agents exert a PAE against gram-negative bacteria. In this study, the PAEs of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus faecalis were determined. The differences in PAE determined by three different techniques--filtration, centrifugation, and dilution--were assessed for S. aureus and E. coli. Ciprofloxacin had a PAE by all three methods, and filtration was used in the majority of studies. A ciprofloxacin concentration of 3 micrograms/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth, pH 7.4, with two hours of exposure produced a PAE of three to four hours for gram-negative bacilli, and 1.9 hours for S. aureus, but had no effect on S. faecalis. Exposure of organisms in urine to 300 micrograms/ml of ciprofloxacin for two hours produced a two- to six-hour PAE for E. coli, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae. Use of Mueller-Hinton broth with a magnesium concentration of 8 mM, pH 5.5, yielded similar results. Using human serum, a four-hour PAE was found for P. aeruginosa. There was a progressive increase in the PAE as the duration of ciprofloxacin exposure was increased from 0.9 hours to three hours. Increasing the ciprofloxacin concentration from two to eight times the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) for P. aeruginosa or from four to 16 times the MBC for E. coli did not cause a significant difference in the PAE using a two-hour exposure. Overall, ciprofloxacin produced an excellent PAE for most gram-negative bacteria and for S. aureus, but not for S. faecalis. A PAE caused by ciprofloxacin can be demonstrated in broth supplemented with magnesium, in urine, in serum, and in broth with the pH adjusted to an acidic level and with the increased magnesium concentration found in urine. These results support less frequent dosing programs for ciprofloxacin in the treatment of tissue and urinary infections.
TI  - Survival of selected bacterial species in sterilized activated carbon filters and biological activated carbon filters.
AB  - The survival of selected hygienically relevant bacterial species in activated carbon (AC) filters on a bench scale was investigated. The results revealed that after inoculation of the test strains the previously sterilized AC absorbed all bacteria (10(6) to 10(7)). After a period of 6 to 13 days without countable bacteria in the effluent, the numbers of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pseudomonas putida increased up to 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of effluent and 10(6) to 10(7) CFU/g of AC. When Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis were used, no growth in filters could be observed. The numbers of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida, however, decreased immediately and showed no regrowth in nonsterile AC from a filter which had been continuously connected to running tap water for 2 months. Under these conditions an autochthonous microflora developed on the carbon surface which could be demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and culturing methods (heterotrophic plate count). These bacteria reduced E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and P. putida densities in the effluent by a factor of more than 10(5) within 1 to 5 days. The hypothesis that antagonistic substances of the autochthonous microflora were responsible for the elimination of the artificial contamination could not be confirmed because less than 1% of the isolates of the autochthonous microflora were able to produce such substances as indicated by in vitro tests. Competition for limiting nutrients was thought to be the reason for the observed effects.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of a new penem, CGP 31608.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CGP 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. CGP 31608 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter diversus, and Salmonella, Shigella, Aeromonas, and Yersinia spp. with MICs for 50% of the strains (MIC50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and MIC90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem MICs of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. MIC90s were 8 micrograms/ml for Enterobacter species and C. freundii, for which other agents had MICs of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. The MIC90 for Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii, and Providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. Acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. The MIC for P. cepacia, P. fluorescens, and P. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for P. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. Hemolytic streptococci A, B, C, G, and F were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the MIC for Streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. MICs for Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium species and Fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. CGP 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases TEM-1, TEM-2, SHV-1, PSE-1, OXA-2, PSE-4, or by S. aureus. Chromosomal beta-lactamases of type Ia in Enterobacter cloacae P99 and Morganella morganii, Ic in P. vulgaris, K-1 in K. oxytoca, and Id in P. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze CGP 31608. It inhibited TEM-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the P99 enzyme. CGP 31608 induced beta-lactamases in P. aeruginosa, E. cloacae, C. freundii and Providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in MICs for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. Synergy of CGP 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% P. aeruginosa, 60% Enterobacter cloacae, and 50% Serratia marcescens strains. No synergy was found with rifampin. A postantibiotic effect was found against E. coli.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin.
AB  - 805 clinical isolates were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247 in comparison to cefaclor and cefalexin in a serial dilution test on solid medium. Ro 19-5247 had the strongest activity of all drugs tested against streptococci (except Streptococcus faecalis) and was as active as cefaclor and cefalexin against most strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Ro 19-5247 was the only oral cephalosporin active against Bordetella pertussis. It was on average 160 times more active than cefaclor against Haemophilus influenzae. In its activity against enterobacteria Ro 19-5247 was always superior to cefaclor and cefalexin. Only a few strains of Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris and Serratia marcescens were resistant to Ro 19-5247 as were all strains of Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella ozaenae. Ro 15-8074 was inactive against staphylococci but ten times more active than cefaclor and cefalexin against Streptococcus pyogenes. There was no difference in the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae. Against Haemophilus influenzae Ro 15-8074 acted 12 times stronger than cefaclor and 100 times stronger than cefalexin. The activity against enterobacteria corresponded to that of Ro 19-5247. Ro 15-8074 was also active against most strains of Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus vulgaris which were resistant to cefaclor and cefalexin.
TI  - A two-center review of bacteremia in the community hospital.
AB  - There are fewer studies on bacteremia coming from the community hospital, where the practicing family physician is likely to see this problem, than from the university hospital. The hypothesis of this study was that patterns of bacteremia would be different between the two types of hospitals. Two hundred four patient episodes of culture-proven bacteremia from two analogous community hospitals were reviewed. Bacteremia was discovered in 2.6 of 1,000 patients, which is lower than reports from university hospitals. Of the 213 organisms isolated, slightly more were gram-negative than gram-positive, whereas many tertiary care centers report a preponderance of gram-negative organisms. About 20 percent of the episodes of bacteremia ended in death, a rate lower than in many tertiary care centers, and slightly more patients died of gram-negative than gram-positive bacteremia. The most common organisms in descending order were the streptococci and Escherichia coli followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most common sources of bacteremia were, in decreasing order, urinary tract, source unknown, heart valve, and lung. The most common underlying disorders were, in decreasing order, malignancy, diabetes mellitus, complicated urinary tract infection, valvular heart disease, and postoperative infection. Correctness of treatment of bacteremia appeared to increase survival.
TI  - Comparative antibacterial activity of a new oral cephalosporin, BMY-28100.
AB  - BMY-28100 is a new oral cephalosporin which had in vitro activity superior to that of cephalexin and cefaclor against staphylococci, beta-hemolytic streptococcal species, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 50% of Streptococcus faecalis isolates, Listeria monocytogenes, and 50 to 75% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species at less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but high producers of beta-lactamase were resistant. Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Morganella, Providencia, and Pseudomonas species and Bacteroides fragilis were resistant. BMY-28100 was more stable than cefaclor against hydrolysis by beta-lactamases.
TI  - Etiology and diagnosis of neonatal conjunctivitis.
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from the most inflamed eye of 13 of 107 (12%)  infants with neonatal purulent conjunctivitis and from none of 100 healthy infants (p less than 0.01). Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 49 (46%) inflamed eyes and from 8 (8%) healthy eyes (p less than 0.01). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from very few infants with conjunctivitis but not from controls. No organisms could be recovered from 23 (22%) infants with conjunctivitis and from 60 (60%) healthy infants (p less than 0.01). The incidence of neonatal purulent conjunctivitis was 107 (2%), of 5,924 births. Eyes infected with C. trachomatis were significantly more inflamed than eyes from which S. aureus or no organisms could be isolated. Furthermore, conjunctival "pseudomembranes" were associated with C. trachomatis. The age at onset of the chlamydial conjunctivitis was higher compared to the age at onset of conjunctivitis in which S. aureus or no organisms were isolated.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies on cefuzonam (L-105, CZON), a newly semisynthesized cephem antibiotic, were carried out in the field of pediatrics and the following results were obtained. Antibacterial activities of CZON against clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and H. influenzae were compared with those of cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotiam (CTM) and cefazolin (CEZ). CZON was nearly as active as CEZ against S. aureus and S. epidermidis and superior to other antibiotics against other Gram-positive cocci. Against Gram-negative rods, CZON was as active as CMX and superior to other 5 antibiotics compared. Serum concentrations and urinary excretion rates after intravenous bolus injection of CZON at doses of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg for 5 minutes in 1, 5 and 4 cases, respectively, were determined. Mean serum concentrations of CZON at these dose levels were 11.0, 43.8 and 111.5 micrograms/ml at 15 minutes, 2.4, 10.3 and 30.3 micrograms/ml at 1 hour and 0.17, 0.72 and 1.28 micrograms/ml at 4 hours, with serum half-lives of 1.79, 0.88 and 1.19 hours, respectively. Mean cumulative urinary excretion rates within 6 hours after administration were 47.9, 56.3 and 40.3%, respectively. Thirty-four pediatric patients with various bacterial infections (tonsillitis 2, acute bronchitis 1, pneumonia 14, pyothorax 1, sepsis 1, suppurative lymphadenitis 1, UTI 13 and enteritis 1) were treated with CZON at a daily dose of 40-94 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d.. The overall clinical efficacy rate was 94.1%. No adverse reactions were observed except 2 cases with mild diarrhea. Abnormal laboratory findings were also mild; slight elevation of GOT and GPT in 2, eosinophilia in 1 and thrombocytosis in 1. These results clearly indicate the usefulness of CZON in the treatment of bacterial infections in children.
TI  - [Prevention of gram-negative and gram-positive infections using 3 intravenous immunoglobulin preparations and therapy of experimental polymicrobial burn infection using intravenous Pseudomonas immunoglobulin G and ciprofloxacin in an animal model].
AB  - Three immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous infusion were compared in vivo  to determine their relative protective capacity against several gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Polyglobin N is a conventional IgG concentrate. Psomaglobin N is identical in formulation to Polyglobin N but is prepared from the plasma of donors who have naturally high levels of antibody to lipopolysaccharide antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IgGMA is a conventional IgG concentrate containing 12% IgG and 16% IgA. In a murine model of burn wound sepsis the three IgG preparations were similarly protective against three or ten strains of P. aeruginosa. Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.015) more protective than IgG-MA against six of ten and three of ten strains of P. aeruginosa, respectively. In a murine model of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 pneumonia, the three Ig preparations were similarly protective. IgG-MA was significantly more protective (p less than or equal to 0.025) than Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N against Salmonella typhimurium in murine peritonitis. However, the mean protective dose (PD50) of the two later preparations was less than or equal to 20 mg/kg body weight. In models of peritonitis both Psomaglobin N and Polyglobin N were more protective than IgGMA (p less than or equal to 0.004) against Haemophilus influenzae b, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens 06:H3 and group B Streptococcus types 1b and 1c. Psomaglobin N and ciprofloxacin were employed to treat established polymicrobial murine burn wound sepsis resulting from contamination of the burn site with mixtures of P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Psomaglobin N or albumin was given once 16 h after challenge.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Microbiological perspectives of co-trimoxazole.
AB  - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in vitro activity was compared with ampicillin, tetracycline, sulfonamide and trimethoprim against isolates of 24 gram-negative and 11 gram-positive species. The incidence of more than 10% of strains with minimal inhibitory concentrations above 32 mg/l was restricted to Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia rettgeri, Morganella morganii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Occasionally, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae strains with MICs above 32 mg/l were identified. Co-trimoxazole in vitro activity was superior to the comparative drugs for the majority of species. Co-trimoxazole remains an active combination against major pathogens of infections of the upper and lower respiratory, urinary tract and enteric infections with a still low incidence of resistant organisms.
TI  - Ofloxacin in respiratory tract infection. A review of the results of clinical trials in Japan.
AB  - An open clinical study of ofloxacin in respiratory tract infections was conducted with patients receiving daily doses of ofloxacin 300 mg, 400 mg or 600 mg. The duration of treatment was 6 to 14 days for 70% of the patients. Ofloxacin was effective in 668 of 828 patients analysed (80.7%). Of 293 patients with upper respiratory infections, the efficacy rate was 85.3%. In 535 cases with lower respiratory infections, ofloxacin was effective in 78.1%. It is noteworthy that a 70% efficacy rate was obtained in 80 cases with intractable chronic diffuse panbronchiolitis primarily associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. There was no difference in the efficacy rate among various daily doses or severity of infections. In lower respiratory infections the bacterial eradication rate was 80.9% for Gram-positive aerobes (including 80% for Staphylococcus aureus and 76.5% for Streptococcus pneumoniae) and 72.1% for Gram-negative aerobes (including 92.6% for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 32.3% for P. aeruginosa and 97.1% for Haemophilus influenzae). Although there were no serious cases, adverse reactions were noted in 46 of 843 patients (5.5%): 38 cases (4.5%) of gastrointestinal tract reactions (nausea, vomiting, heartburn, etc.), 4 cases (0.5%) of hypersensitivity (e.g. eruption) and 19 (2.3%) of central nervous system effects (e.g. dizziness). Abnormal changes in laboratory findings included elevations of AST (1.2%) and ALT (1.5%) and an increase in the eosinophil count (1.7%).

TI  - Effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial population of Nigerian orange juice.
AB  - The effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial load of Nigerian orange juice was studied over a period of 1 month. Results obtained indicated that pasteurization at 60 degrees and 80 degrees C for 20 to 40 min, freezing at -5 degrees C, and addition of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.4% (w/v) could form a microbiological basis for the preservation of the juice for 1 month. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, L. paramesenteroides, Streptococcus avium, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the micro-organisms isolated from the untreated and treated juice samples.
TI  - [Incidence of deep respiratory tract infections].
AB  - The distribution of respiratory tract infections (RTI) among the general population is not uniform. The incidence in neonates and the elderly (older than 65) is 2 to 3 times higher than that in adults. Examinations to determine the responsible pathogen are conducted in less than 1% of cases of RTI. The overall incidence of Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae in hospitalized patients amounts to 13 to 27%. The incidences of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in intensive care units are approximately 20% each. The management of the disease should be based on an aetiological diagnosis, and must take the individual patient's condition into account. Examination of the sputum or bronchial rinsing fluid is still the most reliable form of diagnosis, however, a sufficient number of quantitative methods must be applied. In hospitalized--and especially intensive care--patients these methods are often successful in isolating H. influenzae and pneumococci which we cannot afford to ignore as pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro studies on microbial incorporation of nitrogen from [15N2] urea and [15N]ammonium chloride by human intestinal flora].
AB  - 6 typical bacteria species of the human intestinal flora (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bifidobacterium sp.) were incubated in a liquid medium for 48 h with [15N2]-urea and [15N]-ammonium chloride. The rates of [15N]-incorporation were calculated. They depend reproducible on the species examined, on the kind of the offered NPN-substance and on the amount of NPN-substance in the medium. With [15N2]-urea the minimal rate of incorporation was 3.8% (E coli) and the maximal one 95.6% (Bifidobacterium sp.). With [15N]-ammonium chloride the corresponding figures were 31.0 (Proteus vulg.) and 98.0% (Bifidobacterium sp.). The findings are discussed with regard to a possible enteral detoxification in uremic patients by bacterial utilization and elimination of urea and ammonia.

TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
TI  - [Piperacillin in the newborn infant. A clinical and pharmacologic study].
AB  - The study involved 70 neonates born at 27 to 48 weeks of pregnancy (mean: 34.2 weeks) and weighing between 840 and 4350 g (mean: 1860 g). In every case piperacillin was combined with an aminoglycoside. The infants were treated for materno-foetal infection (14), post-partum infection (19), enterocolitis (18, surgical in 9 cases) and other post-operative infections (19). The antibiotic combination was given prophylactically in 2 cases. Fifty micro-organisms were isolated in 39 patients: 24 from blood (hemoculture), 2 from CSF, 24 from multiple peripheral samples. There were 13 Gram-positive organisms (Streptococcus B, D, A, Listeria spp.) and 37 Gram-negative organisms (E. coli 14, Klebsiella spp. 10, Enterobacter spp. 6). Clinical and bacteriological cure was obtained in 67 patients. Three failures were recorded, with resistance to treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae and emergence (at hemoculture) of Klebsiella oxytoca under treatment in one patient and of Enterobacter cloacae in another patient. A pharmacokinetic study was performed in 47 neonates. Piperacillin (75 mg/kg per dose) was given twice a day until the 8th day post-partum and three times a day subsequently. The antibiotic was administered either by 30-min infusions or by intravenous or intramuscular injections; 124 serum level measurements were carried out at peak and/or residual level. In 44 infants with normal renal and hepatic function the mean residual level was 23 micrograms/ml (range: 7-100 micrograms/ml) and the mean peak level was 119 micrograms/ml (range: 47-278 micrograms/ml). No local or systemic side-effect was noted, and there was no evidence of toxicity.
TI  - Postantibiotic effect of imipenem on gram-positive and gram-negative micro-organisms.
AB  - The bactericidal effect (BE) of an antibiotic reduces the infective population, and its postantibiotic effect (PAE) assures a persistent inhibition of bacterial cells after a short exposure to the antimicrobial agent. Both effects prevent the early regrowth of the infecting organisms when the antibiotic tissue levels decrease to below the MIC value. The BE and the PAE of imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin, gentamicin and ampicillin on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were investigated with viable counts and continuous impedance monitoring of broth cultures. Imipenem and gentamicin gave similar high BE and PAE values at low concentrations and with short drug exposures in most strains tested. PAE is low or non-existent for Gram-negative strains with other beta-lactam antibiotics. These results suggest the possibility of future clinical studies with new experimental dosage schedules for imipenem.
TI  - Experience with imipenem/cilastatin in the intensive care unit.
AB  - Twenty-two patients admitted to the ICU with a severe nosocomial infection caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli were treated with imipenem combined with cilastatin. We treated nine cases of meningo-ventriculitis, eight cases of septicaemia, four cases of mediastinitis, and one case of pneumonia. The bacteria responsible were Acinetobacter spp. (10), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), Enterobacter cloacae (5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3), Proteus spp. (2), Streptococcus spp. (2), Serratia marcescens (1). More than one pathogen was isolated in five cases. The dosages ranged between 1.5 g to 4 g per day by intravenous infusion; the highest doses were used for the treatment of meningitis. The mean duration of treatment was 17 days. An aminoglycoside was combined with imipenem in 18 cases. Cure was obtained in 17 out of the 22 cases. Very rapid sterilization of the CSF in the cases of meningitis and ventriculitis was noted. Two patients died rapidly despite eradication of the bacteria. One case of meningitis relapsed but cure was subsequently obtained with continuation of the same treatment. In three cases of Ps. aeruginosa infection, resistant mutants were isolated from the sites of infection and were responsible for two failures and one colonization. Imipenem appears to be an antibiotic of choice in severe nosocomial infections including meningo-ventriculitis, especially those caused by Acinetobacter spp. and Ps. aeruginosa. It is also one of the few antibiotics active against both streptococci and multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. Careful bacteriological monitoring is recommended during treatment.
TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia caused by mixed aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mixed bacterial pneumonia caused by organisms other than anaerobes has been infrequently reported. We describe six cases and review the literature. Two patients had co-infection with S pneumoniae and L pneumophila. Two were infected with S pneumoniae and K pneumoniae and the others simultaneously harbored M tuberculosis and N asteroides. The first two sets of patients had bacteria isolated from usually sterile sites (blood and lung), while the latter harbored repeatedly isolated organisms not usually felt to be part of the normal respiratory flora. Mixed infection may help explain the substantial mortality still seen from pneumonia. This is especially true if Legionella, mycobacteria, or Nocardia species are encountered where routine smears and cultures may not aid in the diagnosis. Poor clinical response to specific antibacterial therapy in pneumonia should trigger further investigation for other potential pathogens.
TI  - Oral ciprofloxacin therapy of infection caused by multiply resistant bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Of 125 patients treated with ciprofloxacin at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, 34 had infections due to bacteria other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean age of the patients was 50 years (19-88 years) and most had significant underlying disease. There were nine lower respiratory infections, eight urinary tract infections, eight soft tissue infections, three osteomyelitis, and three intra-abdominal infections. The pathogens were: Escherichia coli, 7 (mean MIC 0.07 mg/l); Serratia marcescens, 6 (0.2 mg/l); Enterobacter spp., 5 (0.1 mg/l); Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 (0.1 mg/l); Proteus mirabilis, 3 (0.06 mg/l); Cutrobacter freundii, 2 (0.06 mg/l), Staphylococcus aureus, 3 (0.5 mg/l); and one each of Acinetobacter anitratus. Haemophilus, influenzae, Salmonella enteritidis, Flavobacterium meningosepticum, and Streptococcus faecalis. Of these organisms 81% were resistant to ampicillin, 70% to carbenicillin, 22% to gentamicin, 49% to cefazolin and cephalexin, and 25% to cotrimoxazole. Ten patients had concomitant Ps. aeruginosa infections. Patients were treated orally with 500 mg or 750 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 h. The overall clinical response rate was 88%, and the bacteriological response 76%, and 65% if Ps. aeruginosa is included. Resistance to ciprofloxacin developed in one Staph. aureus and one Ser. marcescens (MIC greater than 2 mg/l). Toxicity was minor. Ciprofloxacin was effective and safe therapy of infections due to Gram-negative bacteria resistant to many of the currently available oral and parenteral agents.
TI  - Clinical efficacy of sulbactam/ampicillin in pediatric infections caused by ampicillin-resistant or penicillin-resistant organisms.
AB  - Twenty-three children two months to 11 years old were treated with sulbactam/ampicillin or sulbactam/penicillin. Eleven had urinary tract infections (UTI), eight had pus-forming cervical adenitis, and four had lobar pneumonia. Pathogens were isolated from 18 patients: Escherichia coli from 10, Staphylococcus aureus from seven, and Klebsiella pneumoniae from one. All isolates were resistant to ampicillin or penicillin alone. Sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) plus ampicillin (1:2 or 1:3 ratio) or penicillin (1:1.2 or 1:1.8 ratio) was given by intravenous bolus injection at 6-hr intervals for four to 11 days (mean duration, nine days). All pathogens were eradicated during treatment. Two patients with UTI relapsed after completion of treatment; the isolates were resistant to the combination. Clinical response was rapid and consistent with bacteriologic findings. Twenty-two of 23 children had a favorable clinical response. No systemic or local adverse effects were recorded. One child had eosinophilia and another had neutropenia at the end of treatment. Four children had slight and transient increases in hepatic transaminases. These results indicate that sulbactam/ampicillin may prove safe and effective for the treatment of non-life-threatening pediatric infections.
TI  - Sulbactam/ampicillin vs. chloramphenicol/ampicillin for the treatment of meningitis in infants and children.
AB  - Eighty-one patients ages one month to 14 years with meningitis were randomized to receive either sulbactam (50 mg/kg per day) and ampicillin (400 mg/kg per day; 41 patients) or chloramphenicol and ampicillin (40 patients). The groups were comparable in terms of sex and degree of illness; however, more patients treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin than patients treated with sulbactam/ampicillin were younger than 12 months of age (78% vs. 56%). Pathogens were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 65 (80%) of the 81 patients. In the sulbactam/ampicillin group, there were 18 Haemophilus influenzae isolates (one resistant to ampicillin), five Streptococcus pneumoniae, five Neisseria meningitidis, one Klebsiella pneumoniae, one Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one Listeria. In the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group, there were 19 H. influenzae isolates, 10 S. pneumoniae, three N. meningitidis, one Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and one Citrobacter. Of 63 patients with assessable CSF pathogens, one (3%) of 29 treated with sulbactam/ampicillin died (S. pneumoniae) and six (18%) of 34 treated with chloramphenicol/ampicillin died (two, H. influenzae; three, S. pneumoniae; and one, Citrobacter). Twelve percent in the sulbactam/ampicillin group and 18% in the chloramphenicol/ampicillin group had neurologic sequelae. No clinically significant reactions or toxicities were noted. Sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as chloramphenicol/ampicillin in the treatment of meningitis.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - [Comparison of in vitro activities of first, second and third generation cephem antibiotics against various pathogens isolated from clinical material in 1985].
AB  - In vitro susceptibilities of 2,133 strains of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials in 1985 to various cephem antibiotics were studied using the Showa disk diffusion test. The following antibiotics were evaluated: cephalexin (CEX), cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ), cefotiam (CTM), cefoxitin (CFX), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefotaxime (CTX), cefoperazone (CPZ), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX), latamoxef (LMOX) and cefsulodin (CFS). S. aureus: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX and CMZ with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml accounted for 93, 73, 94, 80 and 96% of the strains tested respectively, while those susceptible to CTX, CPZ, CZX, CMX, LMOX and CFS accounted for 91, 65, 53, 96, 65 and 95%, respectively. Susceptible strains to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml were 52%. Prevalence of bacterial resistance to CEX and CEZ, which have been used extensively, was greater than that to CET, CTM or CMZ, showing a bimodal distribution of MICs. The third generation cephems studied, in general, also showed bimodal distributions of MICs. S. epidermidis: Susceptible strains to CET, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CPZ and CMX with MICs less than 15 micrograms/ml were more than 82% of the strains tested. S. pyogenes: All strains studied were susceptible to CET, CEZ, CTM, CFX, CMZ, CTX, CPZ, CZX and CMX at MICs less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml. However, susceptible strains to either LMOX or CFS accounted for 95%, while those to CEX at MICs less than or equal to 20 micrograms/ml accounted for 95%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Paediatric meningitis in the western Cape. A 3-year hospital-based prospective survey.
AB  - Between July 1981 and June 1984 1223 cases of meningitis were seen in the Department of Paediatrics, Tygerberg Hospital. The commonest form in each population group was aseptic meningitis. Positive viral cultures were obtained from the CSF in 108 cases. The median age of white children with aseptic meningitis, 64 months, was significantly greater than that of coloured children, 45 months (P greater than 0.0001), and black children, 26 months (P greater than 0.014). The commonest cause of confirmed bacterial meningitis was Neisseria meningitidis (140 cases; 11.5%), which continues to affect mainly young coloured children (median age 16.9 months). Resistance to sulphonamides was found among 21% of 114 N. meningitidis isolates. Among white children Haemophilus influenzae was responsible for 9 of the 18 cases of confirmed bacterial meningitis. Tuberculosis was responsible for 62 cases of meningitis (5%) and was a commoner cause of meningitis than either H. influenzae (47 cases) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (34 cases). Thirty-four confirmed cases of bacterial meningitis were seen in children less than 1 month old. Klebsiella species were responsible for 8 cases (24%), Escherichia coli for 6 cases (12%), group B beta-haemolytic Streptococcus for 5 cases (15%) while 4 cases each were due to N. meningitidis and Strept. pneumoniae.
TI  - Evaluation of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in  patients with cirrhosis.
AB  - To determine the efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis in patients with hepatic cirrhosis, 14 patients (7 males, 7 females) with 16 Gram-negative infective episodes (12 Escherichia coli and 4 Klebsiella pneumoniae) were treated with aztreonam infusions at doses of 1 gm per 8 hr for a planned 14-day period. Ages ranged from 40 to 75 years with a mean of 57 +/- 10 years. All organisms were highly susceptible to aztreonam (minimal inhibitory concentration less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms per ml). Serum antibiotic levels were 61.9 +/- 25.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 27 +/- 18.5 micrograms per ml (trough). Ascitic fluid antibiotic levels were 33.6 +/- 22.5 micrograms per ml (peak) and 32.7 +/- 16.8 micrograms per ml (trough). Although the symptoms of infection were controlled within 3 days and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr, 10 patients (62.5%) died, with hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage as the principal causes of death. Three patients developed streptococcal superinfections during treatment; Streptococcus faecalis peritonitis in one case and spontaneous bacteremia due to Streptococcus equinus and Streptococcus mutans in the other two. Aztreonam was well tolerated and clinically and bacteriologically efficacious in controlling the infection. Serum and ascitic fluid levels were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentration for the causative organisms, suggesting that lower doses may achieve suitable therapeutic levels. A negative aspect of the antibiotic therapy was the superinfections. The high mortality rate was attributable to the generally poor underlying condition of the patients.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of two oral cephalosporins, ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074).
AB  - Ceftetrame (Ro 19-5247) and cefetamet (Ro 15-8074), two new orally administered aminothiazolyl imimomethoxy cephalosporins, inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml but were less active against staphylococci than were cephalexin and cefaclor. They did not inhibit S. faecalis, S. faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Corynebacterium JK species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including ampicillin-resistant isolates, were inhibited at less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. Both agents inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Citrobacter diversus, and Aeromonas hydrophila resistant to ampicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, although many isolates of Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime were not inhibited by these agents. A marked inoculum effect was noted for Enterobacteriaceae carrying the Richmond-Sykes type 1A chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, but plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases did not hydrolyze the compounds. Both drugs inhibited the chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase of E. cloacae, P99.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of benzothiazolo[3,2-a]quinolone antibacterial  agents.
AB  - A new class of heterocyclic compounds with potent antibacterial activity, namely, 2-substituted amino-3-fluoro-5,12-dihydro-5-oxobenzothiazolo[3, 2-a]quinoline-6-carboxylic acids, is described. The compounds are conformationally restricted analogues of 7-substituted amino-6-fluoro-1-aryl-1, 4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acids. Compounds 7 and 10, having a 4-methylpiperazinyl and a piperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, respectively, possess in vitro antibacterial activities comparable to norfloxacin (15). Compound 8, which has a 4-acetylpiperazinyl substitution at the 2-position, is active against Gram-positive organisms and nearly inactive against Gram-negative organisms. An efficient and short synthesis of this novel heterocyclic system via an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement cyclization reaction is reported.
TI  - Growth of environmental mastitis pathogens in various bedding materials.
AB  - The objective of the study was to determine whether, under controlled conditions, bedding materials vary in their ability to support growth of different environmental pathogens independent of the presence of feces, urine, or other contamination. Five sterilized bedding materials (fine hardwood chips, recycled dried manure, chopped newspaper, softwood sawdust, and chopped straw) and three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus uberis) were used for a total of 15 bedding/bacteria combinations, replicated in three trials. Samples were incubated at 37 degrees C, and bacterial counts were determined over 5 d. Rapid growth was seen in straw and recycled manure, some growth occurred in hardwood chips, and a rapid decline in bacterial counts was observed in paper and softwood sawdust. In general, K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed more rapid growth or less rapid decline than did S. uberis. These results demonstrate that clean, damp bedding may support bacterial growth and suggest that high bacterial counts under barn conditions are influenced by factors more complex than type of bedding used.
TI  - Growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of sputum isolates on the L-forms of Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - The growth-enhancing effects of culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, as well as normal floral bacteria other than Neisseria perflava and Branhamella catarrhalis on L-forms of H. influenzae were examined in vitro, using five species of major respiratory pathogenic bacteria and seven species of normal floral bacteria commonly isolated from the sputum of patients with chronic respiratory tract infections. The growth-enhancing factor(s) was present in the filtrates prepared from the culture of respiratory pathogenic Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, the effects of which were as potent as those of a culture filtrate of B. catarrhalis used as the positive control. The culture filtrates of respiratory pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae had weak growth-enhancing effects on H. influenzae L-forms. The culture filtrates of 21 strains of normal floral bacteria isolated from the sputum including alpha-hemolytic Streptococci, non-hemolytic Streptococci, Micrococcus roseus, coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Neisseria spp. had growth-enhancing effects on the L-forms of H. influenzae. These data elucidate the significance of L-forms of H. influenzae in recurrent infections due to H. influenzae in patients with chronic respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Determination of the bactericidal potency of cefatrizine and other oral antibiotics against Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes].
AB  - The in vitro determination of the T log and the minimal bactericidal time of cefatrizine was evaluated against H. influenzae, Str. pyogenes A isolated from clinical specimens. and K. pneumonia ATCC 10031 and compared with that of amoxycillin, cefaclor, cefroxadine and miocamycin against the same bacterial strains. Cefatrizine demonstrate the shorter TMB against all bacterial strains and antibiotic tested with MBCs.
TI  - Preferential secretion of a common anti-DNA idiotype (16/6 Id) and anti-polynucleotide antibodies by normal mononuclear cells following stimulation with Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 6 normal subjects were incubated  with 5 polyclonal activators (pokeweed mitogen, Epstein-Barr virus, group-A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. After 7 days of incubation, the supernatants were examined for immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) production, the level of a common anti-DNA idiotype (16/6 Id) and autoantibody activity against ssDNA, dsDNA, poly(I), poly(dT) and cardiolipin. Significantly increased levels of the 16/6 Id were recorded only with the Klebsiella stimulated MNC. Increased immunoglobulin levels and autoantibody reactivity were noted with all 5 polyclonal activators. The Klebsiella cell membrane preparation induced the highest values. No correlation was found between the 16/6 levels, autoantibody activity and the absolute concentrations of IgG or IgM. This study, together with previous reports, suggests a role for Klebsiella in the etiology of autoimmune diseases. We suggest that Klebsiella can induce anti-DNA-like autoantibodies not only by polyclonal activation, but also by a more specific stimulus.
TI  - Appearance of specific antibody-bearing cells in human bronchial mucosa after local immunization with bacterial vaccine.
AB  - The immune response to local in vivo inhalation of a lysed bacteria vaccine was assessed in surgical specimens of main-stem bronchi from patients who had undergone pneumectomy for cancer. The patient population included 22 subjects; 11 of these received the aerosol vaccine twice a day for 10 days prior to surgery, while the remaining 11 patients were used as controls and were not immunized. The submucous glands of immunized subjects showed significantly more cells than did those of the controls, i.e., 62 +/- 8 versus 37 +/- 7, respectively (P less than 0.05). The following five antigens were chosen for study by fluorescence assay: Streptococcus pneumoniae types II and III, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus sp. strain D19, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. An immunization-dependent correlation was found between immunoglobulin A, immunoglobulin A-bearing cells, and specific antibody-bearing cells on the one hand and three of the five antigens (S. pneumoniae types II and III and Streptococcus sp. strain D19) on the other hand. This is the first time that a relationship has been established between bacterial immunization of the lower respiratory tract and local immunoglobulin production in humans.
TI  - Immunocompromised animal models for the study of antibiotic combinations.
AB  - Studies of various models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in neutropenic animals have demonstrated the superiority of the combination of beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics when compared with a single drug alone. A limited number of studies carried out in models of Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in neutropenic animals have shown similar results. The efficacy of double beta-lactam combinations for the treatment of gram-negative bacillary infections has not been studied as extensively; the few available reports did not show any benefit over a single beta-lactam treatment. Most studies of combined therapy in gram-positive infections have been performed in the experimental endocarditis model. Experiments in Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus faecalis endocarditis have shown a clear-cut advantage for combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment over single beta-lactam therapy, as predicted by in vitro tests. The enhanced efficacy of combined beta-lactam/aminoglycoside treatment in both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections appears to result in most studies in increased and faster killing of the bacteria. With P. aeruginosa infections, however, experiments in neutropenic mice suggest that in addition to increased killing, the beta-lactam arm of the combined treatment prevents the emergence of the small colony variants that lead to treatment failures during therapy with aminoglycoside alone. For both gram-negative bacillary and gram-positive coccal infections, in vitro tests that demonstrated synergism for the combined antibiotics generally predicted enhanced therapeutic efficacy in vivo. Conversely, when no synergism was demonstrated in vitro, there was generally no increased efficacy of combined treatment in vivo. Animal models add a dimension to our understanding of the efficacy of antibiotics, both singly and in combination, that is not always apparent from the results of in vitro tests alone. These in vivo tests can be of value when planning clinical trials.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone, compared with that of other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new 4-quinolone, was determined against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The MICs for 90% of the isolates tested were 0.25 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.5 microgram/ml for Streptococcus faecalis, 0.25 microgram/ml for staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains, and less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Shigella spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. CI-934 had activity superior to that of other quinolones against streptococci by four- to eightfold. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, ciprofloxacin was 2- to 18-fold more active; ofloxacin and norfloxacin were twofold more active or similar to CI-934. CI-934 inhibited ampicillin-cephalothin-resistant urinary isolates of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis and cefoxatime-resistant Acinetobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii. The medium, inoculum size, and oxygen concentration, as well as the addition of serum, had not major effect on the activity of CI-934. Magnesium at a concentration of 9 mM increased MICs and MBCs four- to eightfold, and testing at pH 6 increased MICs as much as 32- to 64-fold for some organisms in comparison with MICs at pH 7. The frequency of spontaneous mutation to resistance was comparable to that for other new quinolones, but resistant isolates could be selected by repeated subculture.
TI  - Timentin in combination with tobramycin as empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with haematological malignancies.
AB  - Timentin (5.2 g tds) and tobramycin (40 mg tds) were administered to 51 patients  (22 male, 29 female, age range 17-72, mean age 40.4) with acute leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia in blastic crisis, severe aplastic anaemia and acute agranulocytopenia. All patients had neutropenia (PMN less than 1000/mm3) and fever (greater than 38 degrees C). Febrile episodes consisted of 22 proved septicaemias due to Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, enterococcus) in 11 cases and to Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alkaligenes faecalis, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in 10 cases. One patient had a polymicrobial infection (P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, non-haemolytic streptococcus). Twenty-nine infections were diagnosed only clinically. The mean duration of treatment was 11.1 days (range 4-20 days). Eighty-seven per cent of evaluable febrile episodes improved. Among 11 infections due to Gram-positive cocci, eight (72%) resolved, and in nine (90%) of ten cases due to Gram-negative bacilli success was obtained. The polymicrobial infection also resolved. In only four patients were mild side effects seen, e.g. exanthema, pruritus, phlebitis: renal toxicity was not observed. These data suggest that the combination of Timentin and tobramycin is an effective and safe empirical antibiotic regimen in febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - The effects of inhalation of organic chemical air contaminants on murine lung host defenses.
AB  - The potential health hazards of exposure to threshold limit value (TLV) concentrations of acetaldehyde, acrolein, propylene oxide, chloroform, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, allyl chloride, methylene chloride, ethylene trichloride, perchloroethylene, benzene, phenol, monochlorobenzene, and benzyl chloride, compounds which may be present in the ambient or work room atmosphere were investigated. The effects of single and multiple 3-hr inhalation exposures were evaluated in mice by monitoring changes in their susceptibility to experimentally induced streptococcus aerosol infection and pulmonary bactericidal activity to inhaled Klebsiella pneumoniae. When significant changes in these parameters were found, further exposures were performed at reduced vapor concentrations until the no-measurable-effect level was reached. Multiple exposures on 5 consecutive days were then performed at this concentration. Significant increases in susceptibility to respiratory streptococcus infection were observed after single 3-hr exposure to TLV concentrations of methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, and ethylene trichloride. For methylene chloride and perchloroethylene, these exposure conditions also resulted in significantly decreased pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - Pneumonia in the elderly.
AB  - Pneumonia from bacterial and viral agents is the fourth leading cause of death in persons over age 65, accounting for 169.7 deaths per 100,000 persons per year. This high incidence of infection is the result of aging itself as well as age-related coexisting illnesses and their therapies. These factors combine to affect upper and lower respiratory tract host defenses adversely against invading pathogens. Gram-negative colonization of the oropharynx, followed by the spread of bacteria to the tracheobronchial tree, commonly precedes the development of pneumonia. Bacterial adherence is one important and modifiable pathogenetic factor that leads to colonization at both of these sites. Diagnosis of pneumonia in the elderly is often thwarted by difficulties in recognizing infection, as signs and symptoms differ from those observed in younger patients. Therapy is confounded by the frequent inability to obtain adequate culture material to establish a likely pathogen and by altered drug metabolism. In this instance epidemiologic data may be helpful in guiding therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common pathogen in community patients, followed by Legionella pneumophila and enteric gram-negative bacilli. Hospitalized and institutionalized individuals are commonly infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae and other enteric gram-negative bacilli, and Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae are also found. Because recognition of pneumonia may be difficult and therapy is fraught with problems, mortality is high in the elderly. Accordingly, serious attention must be paid to prevention. Prophylaxis includes the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines as well as careful attention to the patient's host defense status. Disease states leading to impairment of the immune system should be sought, and efforts should be made to improve host factors that assist the individual in removing invading pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia was studied prospectively for 3 1/2 years in a 549-bed facility with acute medical-surgical care wards, convalescent wards, and a chronic care unit. Bacteriological studies were limited to transtracheal aspirates, pleural fluid, and blood cultures. The predominant isolates in 159 patients were gram-negative bacilli (47%), anaerobic bacteria (35%), Staphylococcus aureus (31%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (26%). Nearly half of all specimens yielded a polymicrobial flora with more than one potential pathogen. Distribution of pathogens was similar with analysis of all patients, including patients with a monomicrobial infection and patients with bacteremic pneumonia. The prevalence of cases and distribution of bacteria were similar for patients located on acute medical-surgical wards and those in the nursing home care unit. Nosocomial pneumonia was judged directly responsible for lethal outcome in 19% of patients and a contributing factor to death in another 13%.

TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to other antibiotics.
AB  - Pefloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. A comparison was made of the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin and that of nine other antibiotics (ampicillin, ticarcillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin and norfloxacin). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 500 strains of Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.25 mg/l (Escherichia coli, indole + Proteus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp.) to 1 mg/l (Klebsiella pneumoniae). Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 2.5 mg/l (range 0.25 mg/l-4 mg/l). The MIC90 of pefloxacin against 100 Staphylococcus aureus strains (78 oxacillin resistant strains) was 0.4 mg/l (range 0.12-0.5 mg/l). It was markedly less active against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. pneumoniae (37 strains of each species) the MIC90 being 4 mg/l against both species. Overall, pefloxacin was at least as active as the third-generation cephalosporins against Enterobacteriaceae and was more active than any other antibiotic tested against P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus. Against E. coli, pefloxacin had a more rapid anti-bacterial activity than piperacillin. A paradoxical effect was observed with pefloxacin. An optimal killing rate was observed at concentrations of pefloxacin compatible with those one can expect in blood of patients treated with this drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of newer quinolones against aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Nalidixic and five newer 4-quinolones, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin were tested against 576 recent clinical aerobic bacterial isolates. The 4-quinolones were regularly active (MIC90 less than 4 mg/l) against the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. saprophyticus, different Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Agrobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Plesiomonas spp., Neisseria meningitidis. Other bacteria were usually intermediately susceptible or resistant: different streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia asteroides, P. maltophilia, Achromobacter xylosoxydans and Alcaligenes denitrificans. Ciprofloxacin was the most potent compound, followed by ofloxacin and pefloxacin, norfloxacin and enoxacin being less active. All the 4-quinolones were much more active than nalidixic acid. The MBC/MIC ratios of the 4-quinolones were between 1 and 2 with a majority of strains, and between 2 and 3 with Streptococcus agalactiae, Str. faecalis and L. monocytogenes. A two- to eight-fold increase of MIC was observed by increasing the inoculum 10,000-fold with most of the strains tested. Susceptible bacterial population of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens and P. aeruginosa contained more clones resistant to nalidixic acid (10(4) to 10(8) at four times the MIC) than to 4-quinolones (10(5) to 10(9) at four times the MIC). Supplementing the media with MgSO4 produced smaller inhibition zone diameters with a disc diffusion method than those obtained with non-supplemented agar, with all quinolone or strains. Less regular effect, or no effect was obtained after supplementation with ZnSO4 or Ca(NO3)2.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on cefotaxime].
AB  - The most frequently encountered infectious disease in the field of internal medicine is respiratory tract infections. One of the most important requirements for an antibiotic in the treatment of infections is that it must be efficiently transferred to the infected site to attain a high concentration there. In the case of respiratory tract infections, it is desirable for the drug concentration in the sputum to be higher than the MIC for the causative bacterium. Cefotaxime (CTX) expresses potent antibacterial activity against Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, which are the major causative bacteria of respiratory tract infections. CTX also exerts antibacterial effects against a wide range of other bacteria. We administered CTX to patients with respiratory tract infections, then measured and compared the drug concentrations in the serum and sputum. The results are described below. When 2 g of CTX was drip-infused, the drug concentration in the serum was 113.0 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after the completion of infusion, 64.9 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes, 38.7 micrograms/ml at 1 hour, 19.0 micrograms/ml at 2 hours, 8.9 micrograms/ml at 4 hours and 3.8 micrograms/ml at 6 hours. The drug concentration in the sputum was 1.29 micrograms/ml at 5 minutes after completion of infusion, 1.54 micrograms/ml at 5 to 30 minutes, 1.36 micrograms/ml at 30 minutes to 1 hour, 1.47 micrograms/ml at 1 to 2 hours, 1.12 micrograms/ml at 2 to 4 hours and 1.35 micrograms/ml at 4 to 6 hours. The drug concentration in the serum was the highest at 5 minutes after completion of the drip-infusion, and then it gradually decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Septic thrombosis of the dural venous sinuses.
AB  - From 1940 to 1984, 19 cases of septic dural-sinus thrombosis have been diagnosed  at the Massachusetts General Hospital, and some 136 cases have been reported from other institutions. Septic thrombosis most frequently involves the cavernous sinuses (96 cases). Facial or sphenoid air sinus infection often precede cavernous-sinus disease. In addition to the classical signs of proptosis, chemosis, and oculomotor paralysis, isolated sixth-nerve palsy and hypo- or hyperesthesia of the fifth nerve may be found. The major pathogens associated with cavernous-sinus infection include Staphylococcus aureus, other gram-positive organisms, and anaerobes. Septic lateral-sinus thrombosis (64 cases) is almost exclusively a complication of otitis media and/or mastoid infection. Organisms causing this infection include Proteus species, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, and anaerobes. Septic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus (23 cases) most frequently accompanies bacterial meningitis or air sinus infection. Causative organisms include Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. aureus, other streptococci, and Klebsiella species. Because septic dural-sinus thrombosis is rare, this disease is frequently misdiagnosed. Evaluation should include lumbar puncture, air sinus films, and computed tomographic scan with contrast. Other helpful diagnostic tests may include carotid angiography, and dynamic brain scan. Orbital venography is the most definitive study in cases of chronic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. Therapy should include intravenous antibiotics and early surgical drainage of purulent exudate in the air sinuses or mastoid regions. Retrospective analysis suggests that treatment with heparin may reduce mortality in carefully selected cases of septic cavernous-sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation is not recommended in other forms of septic dural-sinus thrombosis. Mortality in the antibiotic-era remains high, particularly in patients with septic thrombosis of the cavernous (30%) and superior sagittal (78%) sinuses.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 compared with other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of SK&F 88070 (7-[[2-amino-4-thiazolyl)(methoxyimino)acetyl]amino]-3-[[ [1-(2-sulfaminoethyl)-1H-tetrazol-5-yl]thio]methyl]-3- cephem-4-carboxylic acid) a new parenteral cephalosporin was investigated against 780 types of bacteria. SK&F 88070 inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella species, Shigella species, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Its activity against these species was similar to cefotaxime and moxalactam and superior to cefoperazone and piperacillin. It was less active than cefoperazone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and less active than cefotaxime or cefoperazone against Staphylococcus aureus. SK&F 88070 inhibited hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter species, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia, which were resistant to cefotaxime and moxalactam were resistant to SK&F 88070. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by the Proteus vulgaris type 1c enzyme. SK&F 88070 inhibited Richmond-Sykes type 1a beta-lactamases.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of Hemasite access devices.
AB  - Vascular access ports (Hemasites) were recovered from patients in whom they had become foci of infection and were examined according to microbiologic and morphologic techniques. All were covered on their extraluminal surfaces by well-developed biofilms consisting of host material and bacteria and their extracellular products. One Hemasite from which Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis were cultured was covered by a biofilm that consisted of coccoid bacterial cells and occasional fungal cells. Another Hemasite from which Proteus mirabilis was cultured was covered by a polymicrobial biofilm consisting of at least six morphologically distinct bacterial types and their extracellular products. This direct observation of the biofilm mode of bacterial growth on these devices suggests that the colonizing organisms will not be completely recovered by routine microbiologic techniques and that bacteria in the biofilm will tend to resist both host clearance mechanisms and antibiotic therapy. Removal of the device, with its accretion of bacterial biofilm, should allow the resolution of the associated infection.
TI  - Antigen detection in the diagnosis and in the prognostic assessment of bacterial  pneumonias.
AB  - Sputum cultures are not helpful in the immediate management of patients with bacterial pneumonia. Sputum Gram stains may provide a presumptive identification of an etiologic agent; this procedure, however, is insensitive (approximately 50%). Consequently, during the last decade, other more sensitive and specific methods of providing a rapid etiologic diagnosis have been sought. This article discusses data on antigen detection in various body fluids by counterimmunoelectrophoresis and agglutination tests. Results from our own laboratory as well as those reported in the literature are presented. The best estimates of antigen detection rates, by the most sensitive assays, in pneumococcal pneumonia, are as follows: serum, 45%-80%; urine, 50%-64%; and sputum, 75%-100%. There is less information for Haemophilus, Klebsiella, and Pseudomonas pneumonias, but the diagnostic yield is approximately 50%-100%. Data will also be presented on the association between free and complexed antigens and morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal pneumonia. Indicators of morbidity discussed include disseminated intravascular coagulation, duration and severity of illness, and occurrence of nephritis.
TI  - The relationship between Fusobacterium species and other flora in mixed infection.
AB  - Mixed infections with three Fusobacterium species and seven other bacterial species were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Fifteen Fusobacterium isolates (eight F. nucleatum, four F. necrophorum, and three F. varium) and one isolate each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. asaccharolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were studied. Electronmicrographs showed the presence of a thin mucopolysaccharide wall before and after inoculation into mice in 12 isolates which included all of 11 Fusobacterium isolates that induced subcutaneous abscesses. After co-inoculation of Fusobacterium isolates with other species and selective therapy with antimicrobial agents, S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were found to be of equal or greater importance in abscess induction than were Fusobacterium isolates, while Fusobacterium isolates were found to be more important than Group A streptococci and E. coli. Mutual enhancement of the numbers of organisms in mixed infections was observed with Fusobacterium spp. and K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or Bacteroides spp. Suppression of Fusobacterium spp. was noticed only when they were co-inoculated with Group A streptococci. The additive or synergistic capabilities of Fusobacterium species highlighted their potential pathogenicity in infection.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of A-56619 (difloxacin) and A-56620: new aryl-fluoroquinolones.
AB  - A-56619 and A-56620 are two new aryl-fluoroquinolones which are as potent as or more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally and subcutaneously in mouse protection tests against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. A-56619 and A-56620 were more potent than norfloxacin when administered orally against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A-56620 was as potent or two- to threefold more potent than norfloxacin when administered subcutaneously against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infection with Salmonella typhimurium was more effectively treated with A-56619 (50% effective dose [ED50], 1.4 mg/kg per day) than with norfloxacin (ED50, 62.8 mg/kg per day). E. coli or Pseudomonas pyelonephritis in mice was more effectively treated with A-56619 or A-56620 than with norfloxacin. After oral treatment, the ED50s of A-56619 and A-56620 were less than 12.5 mg/kg per day against E. coli and 62.9 and 38 mg/kg per day against P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis, respectively. Norfloxacin was ineffective at 200 mg/kg per day against E. coli or P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis. A-56619 and A-56620 were also more potent than norfloxacin in treatment of mixed bacterial pyelonephritis caused by E. coli and Streptococcus faecalis. A-56619 was at least 30 times more potent than norfloxacin and A-56620 was 4 to 11 times more potent than norfloxacin when administered against Klebsiella pneumonia in mice. A-56619 and A-56620 were at least 2 to 10 times more potent than norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus infections in immunosuppressed mice. A-56619 was equally potent in all in vivo tests when administered orally or subcutaneously, whereas A-56620 was similar to norfloxacin in being more potent when administered subcutaneously. The peak serum levels after subcutaneous and oral administration of A-56619 and A-56620 were higher than that of norfloxacin. The serum hal-lives of A-56619 and A-56620 after subcutaneous and oral administration were longer than the serum half-life of norfloxacin.
TI  - Growth inhibition of environmental mastitis pathogens during physiologic transitions of the bovine mammary gland.
AB  - Ten dairy cows were infused intramammarily near drying off with concanavalin A (conA) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Mammary secretions were collected during physiologic transitions of the udder and were used in an in vitro microbiological assay to determine growth inhibition of mastitis pathogens. As mammary involution progressed, in vitro growth inhibition of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus uberis increased. Mammary secretions from conA- and PHA-treated glands had significantly increased bacterial growth inhibition. Secretions contained significantly increased concentrations of lactoferrin and a decreased citrate:lactoferrin molar ratio earlier in the dry period than did control mammary secretions. Greatest bacterial growth inhibition was observed in mammary secretions obtained 7 days before parturition. However, differences in secretion composition or bacterial growth inhibition were not found between conA- or PHA-treated and control udder halves during the prepartum period. Bacterial growth inhibition by mammary secretion decreased markedly during early lactation. A highly significant positive correlation was found between bacterial growth inhibition and concentrations of lactoferrin, serum albumin, and immunoglobulin G. A highly significant negative correlation was found in the citrate:lactoferrin molar ratio during early involution and the peripartum period.
TI  - Synergy of ciprofloxacin and azlocillin in vitro and in a neutropenic mouse model of infection.
AB  - Combinations of ciprofloxacin with azlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin were  tested in vitro against clinical isolates. Azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed synergy against 30% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates; it was either synergistic or additive against 78% of all isolates tested even those resistant to the beta-lactam. Synergism was rarely noted for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp. or Branhamella spp. isolates. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin plus azlocillin, plus piperacillin and plus ticarcillin against Pseudomonas spp. were reduced 4 or 2 fold, respectively. However, the combination azlocillin plus ciprofloxacin showed primarily indifference against gram-positive strains. Neutropenic mice infected with a lethal challenge of Pseudomonas spp. were protected by a combination of azlocillin and ciprofloxacin. Its additive and/or synergistic effects and expanded spectrum of activity against streptococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and JK corynebacteria may provide an alternative to traditional therapy.
TI  - An analysis of blood culture isolates from 7 South African teaching hospital centres.
AB  - The data on blood culture isolates for 1983 and January - July 1984 reported by the Antibiotic Study Group of South Africa have been analysed to determine national and regional prevalences of different micro-organisms and resistance to certain antibiotics. Although there are significant differences in isolation frequencies between the various centres, overall the five most frequent isolates are Staphylococcus aureus (1983 - 15%; 1984 - 14%), Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella spp. (11%; 10%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9%), and Salmonella typhi (7%; 13%). Staph. aureus ranks first in most centres for 1983 but is displaced in some in 1984 by enteric Gram-negative bacilli. In Durban S. typhi is the most common isolate for the entire period. Methicillin resistance among Staph. aureus is common (approximately 30% overall), especially in the Transvaal. Gentamicin resistance among certain Gram-negative bacilli is a problem in many centres and is especially disturbing in the case of Klebsiella spp., of which over 30% of total isolates are resistant. Ampicillin resistance for Haemophilus influenzae varies from nil to over 30% in different centres, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci are still encountered (nil to over 10%).
TI  - Bacteremia in Charleston County, South Carolina.
AB  - To describe the epidemiology of bacteremia in a large, well defined population, the authors reviewed medical records for residents of Charleston County, South Carolina, who had bacteria isolated from blood in the period 1974 to 1976. The incidence was 80 cases per 100,000 population per year. The most common organisms were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence was highest for neonates, infants, and those 70 years of age and older with annualized attack rates of 1,864,250, and 446 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. The incidence was 3.2 times higher for blacks than for whites and, within races, appeared to be independent of family income. Twenty-five per cent of patients had no clinically apparent focus of infection, 26% had urinary tract infection, and 17% had pneumonia. Thirty-nine per cent of cases were nosocomial, and 30% of patients died.
TI  - Bacteremia following transurethral instrumentation. The predictive value of a serum bactericidal activity test.
AB  - The bacteremic rate following transurethral instrumentation and the possibility of a serum bactericidal activity test to predict which patients that were at an increased risk of developing bacteremia was evaluated. Of 33 investigated patients, all elderly men, 14 underwent transurethral prostatic resection, 14 cystoscopy and 5 urethrotomy. None of the patients received prophylactic antibiotic treatment. The majority (97%) of the patients had bacteria isolated from the urinary tract before the instrumentation. Gram-positive cocci accounted for about two thirds (64%) and Gram-negative rods for about one third (31%) of all isolates. The most frequent species isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (29%), Streptococcus faecalis (19%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%). The bacteremic rate was 21%. None of the patients developed septicemia. Forty-four per cent of the patients with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units/ml (cfu/ml) in urine developed bacteremia compared with 8% in patients with a sterile urine or less than 10(5) cfu/ml in urine (p less than 0.05). The urethral/prostatic flora was the source of bacteremia in at least one patient. Eighty-one per cent of the isolated strains were serum resistant. About half (54%) of the Gram-negative rods were more or less sensitive against actual, fresh patient serum. All Gram-positive cocci were resistant. There was no difference in the serum sensitivity between bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients and non-bacteremic patients. In conclusion, this study confirmed the relative high risk of developing bacteremia following transurethral instrumentation, especially if the urine is infected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Infections of the central nervous system in malignant hemopathies].
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) infections in immunocompromised hosts are often accompanied by subtle disorders because immunosuppression usually decreases the inflammatory response. CNS infections in immunocompromised patients are usually caused by organisms different from those found in the general population. The organism causing CNS infection in an immunocompromised host can often be predicted if the type of immune abnormality of the patient is known. The common causes of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts are reviewed here. Meningitis in patients with neutropenia is usually due to enteric Gram negative bacilli that live in the patient's own digestive tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is most common and is followed by E. Coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Proteus. A major risk in patients with abnormal immunoglobulins or splenectomy is infection with encapsulated bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. Meningitis caused by any of the encapsulated bacteria can be fulminant. Listeria monocytogenes is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in patients with impaired cellular immunity. Nocardia asteroides is a leading cause of brain abscess in patients with hematologic malignancy. Most patients have evidence of concomitant pulmonary lesions. Fungi are among the most common organisms involving the CNS in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptible patients include those with lymphoma or leukemia and those who receive therapies aimed at suppressing delayed hypersensitivity. Cryptococcus neoformans is a common fungal cause of CNS infection in immunocompromised hosts. The primary site of infection is the lung. Spread to the CNS is via the blood stream. The clinical course is highly variable: meningitis, meningoencephalitis and focal mass lesions. Candida causes meningitis or meningoencephalitis characterized by multiple small abscesses in neutropenic hosts. Organisms reach the CNS via the blood stream usually from the digestive tract or infected intravenous catheters. Aspergillus causes brain abscess, cerebral infarction and focal meningitis in patients with neutropenia. The primary infection is in the lung. The parasites that infest the CNS of immunocompromised patients are usually those that exploit a T-lymphocyte, mononuclear phagocyte host defect. The most common are Toxoplasma gondii and Strongyloides stercoralis. There have been a few cases of amebiasis with dissemination to the brain in patients with hematologic malignancies. Toxoplasma gondii causes major CNS disease in immunocompromised hosts: meningoencephalitis or mass lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Ceftriaxone therapy in otolaryngological and pulmonary infections.
AB  - The efficacy of ceftriaxone, 1 g given intramuscularly once daily, was evaluated  in 38 patients with pneumonia (n = 11), pulmonary empyema (n = 2), bronchitis (n = 4), tonsillitis (n = 9), sinusitis (n = 7), and otitis (n = 5). Causative organisms were Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 11), viridans type streptococcus (n = 1), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 6), group A streptococcus (n = 10), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1), Escherichia coli (n = 2), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), and Proteus vulgaris (n = 1). Sterilization of infected foci was obtained in 89.4% of those treated, with clinical recovery in 86.8%. The ceftriaxone regimen was well tolerated.
TI  - Comparative activity of ofloxacin with reference to bacterial strains isolated in in-patients and out-patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was compared to that of other agents commonly in use against pathogens isolated in the community and in the hospital. None of the community or hospital strains isolated from urinary tract infection showed resistance to ofloxacin, while variable resistance was demonstrable with all other oral agents. Similar results were obtained with pathogens isolated from infected wounds originating in the community and in the hospital. Among pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract, ofloxacin was most active against Haemophilus influenzae, but less active than the penicillin-cephalosporin group against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ofloxacin was active against all but one (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) blood culture isolates. Of 112 strains isolated from community-acquired infections, only one strain was ofloxacin-resistant while resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim, ampicillin and doxycycline was 34%, 42% and 30%, respectively. Among 219 pathogens originating from nosocomial infections, 3.2% were resistant to ofloxacin compared to 56% for cefazolin, to 7.2% for cefotaxime, 15.8% for piperacillin and 22.3% for gentamicin. These results suggest that ofloxacin has great therapeutic potential for the therapy of bacterial infections originating both in the community and in the hospital.
TI  - Clinical and bacteriological evaluation of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections.
AB  - The clinical significance of Branhamella catarrhalis in respiratory infections is evaluated. 175 strains were isolated, mainly from the sputum, in 71 patients with respiratory infections. B. catarrhalis was most frequently isolated in mixed infections with Haemophilus influenzae (38.3%), H. influenzae plus Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%) or S. pneumoniae (9.7%). The rate of isolation of B. catarrhalis alone was as low as 5.1% and from mixed infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter and/or Klebsiella species it was 36.6%. More than 10(7) cfu/ml of B. catarrhalis were isolated from 71.4% of cases. In 29 cases the organism was determined to be causative according to our criteria, most often in secondary infections in patients with complicated pneumoconiosis, chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis. 29 of 47 strains (61.7%) produced beta-lactamase of the penicillinase type. Against these strains, penicillin antibiotics and first and second generation cephalosporin antibiotics (except cefroxadine) showed weak activity compared with their activity against non-beta-lactamase-producing strains. The third generation cephalosporins showed a uniform spectrum of activity against both groups of organisms.
TI  - [Transfer of cefmenoxime to lung tissue and thoracic muscle in thoracic surgery].
AB  - Twenty patients who were performed pulmonary resection for the disease of the lung were administered 2 g of cefmenoxime (CMX) intravenously during the operation. The CMX levels in serum, lung tissue and thoracic muscle were measured by agar-well technique. The CMX levels in lung tissue and thoracic muscle were higher than the MIC80 of CMX for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae which were commonly as isolated causative organisms from the patients with pulmonary infection. These results indicate that CMX will be useful agent for the prevention and treatment of pulmonary infection.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activity of ceftazidime increased by netilmicin.
AB  - Cephalosporins are often used in combination with aminoglycoside antibiotics in the treatment of gram-negative infections. Although ceftazidime possesses activity against gram-negative bacteria, especially against Pseudomonas, combined use with aminoglycosides is useful. In this study, 12 healthy volunteers (6 men, 6 women; mean age 21.5 yr) received a single dose of ceftazidime 1 g iv and one week later ceftazidime 1 g iv with netilmicin 100 mg iv. Both antibiotics were infused over five minutes. Concentrations of ceftazidime were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Serum bactericidal activity (SBA) was evaluated against seven microorganisms isolated from clinical specimens. The mean peak serum level of ceftazidime was 113.4 micrograms/ml. At eight hours, we observed a concentration of 2.6 micrograms/ml. The total clearance was 126 ml/min, while the renal clearance was 100 ml/min. Ceftazidime exhibited a half-life of 1.9 hours. Up to ten hours, the SBA of ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhi was greater than 1:8 in more than 90 percent of samples. At one hour, ceftazidime exhibited a SBA of 1:4 for Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:16 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the addition of netilmicin, median SBA against Staph. aureus and P. aeruginosa were 1:32 and 1:64, respectively, at one hour. Netilmicin enhanced the SBA of ceftazidime. The combination was not effective against Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Microbicidal activity of octenidine hydrochloride, a new alkanediylbis[pyridine]  germicidal agent.
AB  - The potential of octenidine hydrochloride (WIN 41464-2) as a topical microbicide  was measured both by in vitro death kinetics and reductions in numbers of bacteria on the skin of cynomolgus monkeys. Semilogarithmic survival curves were plotted to measure the microbicidal activity of various concentrations of octenidine against Staphylococcus aureus. The microbicidal activity of octenidine was also determined for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Candida albicans. Death rates for the same microbial strains were compared with those obtained by using chlorhexidine gluconate. Octenidine concentrations of less than 1.5 microM (0.94 microgram/ml) caused a greater than 99% reduction of each microbial population within 15 min. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most susceptible of the test organisms, and E. coli and C. albicans were the least susceptible. Octenidine was more active than chlorhexidine against each test strain. Skin-degerming activities of aqueous and formulated octenidine and formulated chlorhexidine were compared in single and multiple applications of these agents to the hand and foot surfaces of monkeys by using a glove-juice extraction procedure to measure the skin microflora. Aqueous octenidine, at a concentration of 0.2 to 1.6% reduced resident microflora populations from 90 to 99.98%, depending on the concentration and number of applications. Octenidine formulated at 2% in a surfactant-based vehicle exhibited significantly better skin-degerming activity than did either a nonmedicated vehicle or the Hibiclens brand of 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.
TI  - Disease patterns in the Detroit Zoo: a study of the mammalian population from 1973 through 1983.
AB  - A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate disease patterns in the mammals at the Detroit Zoo from 1973 through 1983. The reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), rednecked Wallaby (Protemnodon rufogrisea), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), and kangaroo (Macropus spp)- were the most frequently affected mammalian species. Parasitic agents (80% of which were internal parasites) caused morbidity in 60.2% of the mammals evaluated (n = 2,475) and microbial agents caused morbidity in 20.8% of the animals. Strongyloides spp, Trichostrongylus spp, coccidian species, Diphyllobothrium spp, and Trichuris spp were the internal parasites most frequently found. Overall annual mortality rate was 14% to 34%, with microbiological agents causing the highest mortality (26.5%). Pasteurella spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp, pathogenic Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium spp, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequent microbial causes of death. Cause of mortality could not be determined in 21.5% of the animals evaluated. The percentage of animals successfully treated increased from 1973 through 1983. Generally, however, the percentage of successfully treated animals was low (21% to 39%).
TI  - The aetiology of purulent meningitis in highland children: a bacteriological study.
AB  - Of 155 highlands children with purulent culture-positive meningitis studied from  March 1980 to September 1984, 84% were aged twelve months or less and 92% were infected with either Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae or both organisms. Other pathogens were Neisseria meningitidis (8 isolations), Streptococcus pyogenes (2 isolations) and Streptococcus agalactiae and Klebsiella species (1 of each). Among H. influenzae isolates, serotype b strains predominated (83%) and most (96%) belonged to biotype I or II. Infections due to non-b haemophili included serotype a (9 strains), serotype f (1 strain) and non-serotypable variants (3 strains). Of 67 S. pneumoniae strains 22% were resistant to benzylpenicillin, with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.1-1.0 micrograms/ml. The commonest serotypes were types 5 (11 isolates), type 7 (9 isolates) and types 2, 6 and 46 (6 of each). No resistance to chloramphenicol was detected in either H. influenzae or S. pneumoniae and only one of 56 strains of H. influenzae was insensitive to betalactam antibiotics. The known case fatality rate in this study was 37%. More children with pneumococcal infection died (46%) than those with haemophilus infection (30%), though the difference was not statistically significant; 79% of all deaths occurred in children aged less than twelve months. There is an urgent need for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccines that are effective in young children.
TI  - [Therapeutic efficacies of suppository of ceftizoxime against experimental infections in mice].
AB  - In experimental infections in mice, the therapeutic efficacies of rectal administration of ceftizoxime (CZX) were compared with those of subcutaneous administration. The efficacies of rectal administration were equivalent to those of subcutaneous administration against intraperitoneal infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii and Serratia marcescens, the efficacies of rectal administration were inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Against urinary tract and respiratory tract infections, the efficacies of rectal administration were slightly inferior to those of subcutaneous administration. Serum concentrations of CZX for rectal administration were less than those of subcutaneous administration.
TI  - Lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The most important lower respiratory infection is pneumonia, the fourth leading cause of death. Most cases of bronchitis are of viral etiology and are not major problems. Empyema can present an important problem in management. Although the diagnosis of pneumonia is usually relatively straightforward, the specific etiologic diagnosis remains a major problem. Availability of empyema fluid or a positive blood culture result can be helpful in making the etiologic diagnosis, but these are unavailable in most patients. Screening of sputum Gram stains under 100 X magnification is very important; there should be fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, more than 25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, or both per field of this size. The major causes of pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, various gram-negative aerobic or facultative bacilli and Legionella. However, many other organisms are capable of causing pneumonia, even in the immunocompetent host. Further adding to the problem is the fact that a number of different organisms are manifesting increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. Our study with ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid included seven patients with pneumonia, one with empyema, and one with purulent tracheobronchitis. Organisms recovered from pleural fluid, transtracheal aspiration and sputum or tracheostomy aspirate included multiple anaerobes, pneumococci, S. aureus, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, beta-hemolytic streptococci, Neisseria meningitidis and Branhamella catarrhalis. Several of the organisms were ticarcillin resistant. Eight of the patients had cures and the other patient showed improvement. Only minor side-effects were encountered--Coombs' positivity (without hemolysis), eosinophilia, drug fever and one case of questionable neutropenia.
TI  - The pharmacokinetic and bactericidal characteristics of oral cefixime.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of cefixime (FK 027), a broad-spectrum cephalosporin, were assessed in 12 normal subjects after single oral doses of 50, 100, 200, and 400 mg. Mean peak serum concentrations were 1.02, 1.46, 2.63, and 3.85 micrograms/ml after the four respective doses. Respective mean serum levels at 12 hours were 0.16, 0.33, 0.72, and 1.13 micrograms/ml. Volumes of distribution averaged 0.1 L/kg body weight, and the elimination t1/2 was 3 hours for all doses. The AUC was 7.01, 11.4, 22.5, and 36.4 micrograms X hr/ml for the four doses, respectively. Serum clearance averaged 0.4 mg/min/kg and mean 24-hour urinary recovery was 21%, 19%, 20%, and 16% for the four respective doses. Serum bactericidal titers at 4 hours exceeded 1:16 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Hemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urine bactericidal titers exceeded 1:8 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae resistant to the available oral cephalosporins.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1983)].
AB  - Bacterial isolates from the patients with pulmonary infections have been collected over these 3 years, in collaboration with investigators at 13 hospitals in various parts of Japan for the study on frequency of isolation of pathogens among the patients and their drug susceptibilities. Possible causative pathogens mainly isolated from sputum in patients with lower respiratory tract infections during period from September 1983 to March 1984, were collected. The frequency of bacterial isolates from the sputum and their drug susceptibility on H. influenzae among the various pathogens are discussed. The kinds of bacterial species isolated from the patients with respiratory tract infections associated with chronic bronchitis, chronic capillary bronchitis or bronchiectasis and their relative frequency of isolation were as follows; Total numbers of bacterial isolates collected from various hospitals were 220 strains in 1981, 168 strains 1982 and 258 strains in 1983. H. influenzae was always isolated with highest frequency of 50.5% in 1981, 45.8% in 1982 and 40.7% in 1983, and followed by P. aeruginosa (24.1%), S. aureus (8.2%), S. pneumoniae (7.3%) and K. pneumoniae (5.9%) and E. coli (4.1%) in 1981; P. aeruginosa (30.4%), S. pneumoniae (11.9%), S. aureus (4.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.0%) and E. coli (1.8%) in 1982; P. aeruginosa (26.7%), S. pneumoniae (10.1%), S. aureus (7.8%), K. pneumoniae (3.5%) and E. coli (3.5%) in 1983. The drug susceptibility test of H. influenzae to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), mezlocillin (MZPC), sulbenicillin (SBPC), gentamicin (GM), amikacin (AMK), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ), cefoperazone (CPZ), cefotaxime (CTX), ceftizoxime (CZX), cefmenoxime (CMX) and latamoxef (LMOX) was done by using agar micro-broth dilution methods. H. influenzae was most markedly susceptible to cephems of the third generation, especially to CMX, CZX and CTX by which about 95% of H. influenzae tested were inhibited the growth under the concentration with less than or equal to 0.10 microgram/ml of the drugs. Furthermore, annual changes in susceptibility of H. influenzae to various antibiotics was analyzed over the period from 1981 to 1983. The frequency of S. pneumoniae isolated from patients with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis was about 10% in this survey. However, in the case of respiratory infections associated with bacterial pneumonia, the frequencies were as follows; 24.8% (77 cases/311 cases) in 1981, 17.7% (44 cases/248 cases) in 1982, and 11.0% (39 cases/355 cases) in 1983. The frequency of isolation of S. pneumoniae decreased every year.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro growth inhibition of mastitis causing bacteria by phenolics and metal chelators.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of three phenolic compounds and four metal chelators were tested at 0, 250, 500, and 1000 ppm in vitro against four major mastitis-causing bacteria, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Overall, butylated hydroxyanisole and tert-butylhydroquinone showed the greatest antimicrobial activity. These phenolics were bactericidal at 250 to 500 ppm against all four bacteria tested. The butylated hydroxytoluene was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but was ineffective against the coliforms. At 250 ppm, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid was bactericidal against the gram-positive bacteria but much less effective against the gram-negatives. However, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid was more growth inhibitory than ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid against the gram-negative bacteria and especially against Escherichia coli. All other compounds were generally much less effective or ineffective against all four microorganisms. Therefore, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, tert-butylhydroquinone, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid may have practical implications in the prevention or treatment of bovine mastitis.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel arylfluoroquinolone antibacterial agents.
AB  - A series of novel arylfluoroquinolones has been prepared. These derivatives are characterized by having a fluorine atom at the 6-position, substituted amino groups at the 7-position, and substituted phenyl groups at the 1-position. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies indicate that the in vitro antibacterial potency is greatest when the 1-substituent is either p-fluorophenyl or p-hydroxyphenyl and the 7-substituent is either 1-piperazinyl, 4-methyl-1-piperazinyl, or 3-amino-1-pyrrolidinyl. The electronic and spatial properties of the 1-substituent, as well as the steric bulk, play important roles in the antimicrobial potency in this class of antibacterials. As a result of this study, compounds 45 and 41 were found to possess excellent in vitro potency and in vivo efficacy.
TI  - Preliminary evaluation of a rapid colorimetric method for the presumptive identification of group A streptococci and enterococci.
AB  - A rapid colorimetric method for the presumptive identification of group A streptococci and enterococci based upon pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase activity is described. Of 76 group A streptococcal isolates from primary plates, 83 gave positive reactions, and the remaining 7 were positive on retesting in pure culture. Of the 31 enterococcal isolates tested, all gave positive reactions. Despite occasional positive reactions with staphylococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae, the test could be useful and cost-effective in the clinical laboratory.

TI  - Crossreactions of Escherichia coli K and O polysaccharides in antipneumococcal and anti-Salmonella sera.
AB  - Crossreactions of 24 K polysaccharides and 4 O polysaccharides of E. coli in antisera to 27 pneumococcal types, 3 anti-Salmonella sera, and anti-Klebsiella Kl serum are discussed in relation to structural features of the polysaccharides insofar as these are known. Predictions based on the crossprecipitations are also ventured for several instances in which structures are as yet undetermined.
TI  - Cefotiam therapy of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Cefotiam, a new cephalosporin, was evaluated in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in 29 patients. The bacteria isolated from the sputum of these patients included Streptococcus pneumoniae (31%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (31%), and Haemophilus influenzae (28%). Satisfactory response was observed in 90% of the patients. There were three treatment failures, two superinfections, and four colonizations with gram-negative organisms resistant to the drug. Superficial phlebitis was noted in two patients. The results of this study suggest that cefotiam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to susceptible organisms.
TI  - Comparison of ceftriaxone and ampicillin plus chloramphenicol for the therapy of  acute bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Ceftriaxone, a new third-generation cephalosporin, appears to be promising for the therapy of acute bacterial meningitis. The 90% MBCs of ceftriaxone against 54 recent cerebrospinal fluid isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml. We examined the efficacy and safety of ceftriaxone therapy of meningitis in Bahia, Brazil. The study was conducted in two phases; in phase A, ceftriaxone was coadministered with ampicillin. The mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ceftriaxone 24 h after an intravenous dose of 80 mg/kg were 4.2 and 2.3 micrograms/ml on days 4 to 6 and 10 to 12 of therapy, respectively. These concentrations were 8- to more than 100-fold greater than the 90% MBCs against the relevant pathogens. In phase B, ceftriaxone (administered once daily at a dose of 80 mg/kg after an initial dose of 100 mg/kg) was compared with conventional dosages of ampicillin and chloramphenicol in a prospective randomized trial of 36 children and adults with meningitis. The groups were comparable based on clinical, laboratory, and etiological parameters. Ceftriaxone given once daily produced results equivalent to those obtained with ampicillin plus chloramphenicol, as judged by cure rate, case fatality ratio, resolution with sequelae, type and severity of sequelae, time to sterility of cerebrospinal fluid, and potentially drug-related adverse effects. The cerebrospinal fluid bactericidal titers obtained 16 to 24 h after ceftriaxone dosing were usually 1:512 to greater than 1:2,048 even late in the treatment course, compared with values of 1:8 to 1:32 in patients receiving ampicillin plus chloramphenicol. Ceftriaxone clearly deserves further evaluation for the therapy of meningitis; the optimal dose, dosing frequency (every 12 h or every 24 h), and duration of therapy remain to be determined.
TI  - A preliminary survey of aerobic bacteria in breast milk of mothers from the low-income group in Nigeria.
AB  - The aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in Nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. In parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. The aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included Streptococcus salivarius, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus epidermides. In general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. An analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. There was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load in mother's milk. Milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin in serum and urine against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Ten volunteers received three doses of 500 mg ciprofloxacin, orally every 12 hours. After the last dose, mean serum levels were (mg/l +/- SD) 2.4 +/- 0.83 at 1 h; 0.91 +/- 0.30 at 4 h and 0.18 +/- 0.04 at 12 h. At 1 h the median serum bactericidal activity was satisfactory only against the Escherichia coli (1:256) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1:128). In urine collected from 0 to 4 h and 8 to 12 h after the last dose, the mean ciprofloxacin level was respectively 482.5 +/- 324.7 and 80.9 +/- 48.2 mg/l +/- SD. Bactericidal activity in urine was high even against the least susceptible species tested: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. A post antibiotic effect was demonstrated in 22 out of the 29 strains tested, ranging mainly from 1 to 3 h. Ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally twice a day is a bactericidal regimen against a wide range of urinary pathogens but has a limited systemic activity.
TI  - The antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a Proteus sp., an Erysipelothrix sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. The intracutaneous injection of Fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to this effect. The in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low MIC; a low MIC was sometimes associated with little action and a high MIC with moderate action. Sixteen organisms were tested. The iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of E. rhusiopathiae. In only one case, with a strain of Proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. On the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-C streptococcus and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, E. rhusiopathiae and A. hydrophila. It is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate excess of readily available Fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). Insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.
TI  - [Therapeutic effects of micronomicin against severe infections in patients with hematopoietic disorders. Hanshin Infection Study Group].
AB  - Micronomicin (MCR) at a daily dose of 120 to 360 mg was administered to patients  with severe infections who had hematopoietic disorders as underlying diseases. Efficacy and safety of the drug were evaluated. The underlying diseases in the 56 patients included in the evaluation of efficacy were acute myelocytic leukemia (24 cases), acute lymphocytic leukemia (8), acute promyelocytic leukemia (6), acute monomyelocytic leukemia (4), acute monocytic leukemia (1), erythroleukemia (1), chronic myelocytic leukemia-blastic crisis (4), malignant lymphoma (3), aplastic anemia (2), and others (3). The infections were septicemia in 9 patients, suspected septicemia in 48, respiratory tract infection in 7, and perianal abscess in 2. The clinical efficacy of MCR was 'excellent' in 12 patients, 'good' in 17, 'fair' in 7, 'poor' in 30 for an efficacy rate of 43.9%. The efficacy rate classified according to infections was 22.2% in septicemia, 56.3% in suspected septicemia. The organisms isolated from the patients with septicemia were Escherichia coli in 2, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Serratia marcescens in 1, and Acinetobacter sp. in 1. The efficacy rate was 15.4% in the 13 patients whose causative organisms were identified. The efficacy rate for patients who had failed to respond to prior antibiotic therapy was 43.9%. The efficacy rate in patients (34 cases) with an initial neutrophil count less than 100/microliter was 44.1%. Side effect which might have been caused by MCR was skin eruption in only one episode among 83 episodes those were evaluated for safety.
TI  - Multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 S ribosomal RNA confers resistance to M, L, and S B-type (MLSB) antibiotics. Investigation, by DNA annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from Streptococcus (groups A,B,D, and H, and pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the MLSB resistance (R) determinants. A minimum of four distinct classes of MLSB R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class C for B. licheniformis, and class D for Bact. fragilis. These data do not support the hypothesis that the R determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the Gram-positive cocci. The genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLSB antibiotics. Inactivation of the drug confers resistance to M and/or L and/or S or SA or SB antibiotics and has been detected in strains of Streptococcus, Staph. aureus, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens, Streptomyces, and recently in the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment conferring high level resistance (MIC greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. The distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. The gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
TI  - Therapy for lower respiratory tract infections with imipenem/cilastatin: a review of worldwide experience.
AB  - The worldwide experience with imipenem/cilastatin as of November 7, 1983, in the  intravenous therapy for severe and moderately severe infections of the lower respiratory tract is reviewed. Of 204 assessable patients treated in 77 studies conducted by 70 investigative groups (43 in the United States, 27 in other countries), 173 (85%) were cured of their infections or showed improvement. Imipenem was tested against 289 of 303 bacterial pathogens isolated before therapy, and 284 (98%) were found to be susceptible. Principal pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella species, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 76% of infecting pathogens were eradicated during therapy. Of 54 imipenem-susceptible infecting strains of P. aeruginosa, however, 57% were eradicated, 19% acquired resistance to imipenem, and 17% were replaced by new resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Higher doses of imipenem/cilastatin and/or combined therapy with an aminoglycoside may improve these results. Imipenem/cilastatin compares well with the most active agents available for therapy for lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin vs. cefotaxime in treatment of severe bacterial infections.
AB  - Adult patients with severe bacterial infections caused by organisms susceptible to imipenem and cefotaxime were given either imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK0787/MK0791) or cefotaxime as a part of a multiclinic randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of imipenem/cilastatin. Clinical diagnoses included bacteremia, urinary tract infection, osteomyelitis, mediastinitis, lower respiratory tract infection, and soft tissue infection. Efficacy was evaluated for 10 patients given imipenem/cilastatin and for 10 patients given cefotaxime. Major pathogens isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus species. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted in 90% of the patients in both treatment groups. Eradication of the pathogen was achieved in nine of 10 patients treated with imipenem/cilastatin and in 10 of 10 patients treated with cefotaxime. No major adverse effects were found in patients in each treatment group. The results of this study suggest that imipenem/cilastatin sodium is a relatively safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of adult patients with severe infections caused by susceptible organisms.
TI  - Recovery of blood-borne bacteria from human urine.
AB  - Recovery from the urine of organisms causing bacteraemia may depend on the bacterial species involved. The survival of the more common species of bacteria which cause bacteraemia was examined in human urine, serum and normal saline. All species survived well or grew in serum. Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus sanguis and group A streptococci were killed in all urine samples. The number of colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and group B streptococci either remained the same or increased in the urine, while the numbers of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased rapidly. These data suggest that the observed differences in recovery from urine of these bacterial species that cause bacteraemia are related to the viability of the species in human urine.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid C-reactive protein in the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis.
AB  - Samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 112 cases of suspected meningitis were tested for the presence of C-reactive protein (CRP), using a qualitative and quantitative slide test. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 34 patients, based on CSF and blood culture results, and/or elevated CSF white blood cell (WBC) count and typical biochemical profile. There were 8 patients with early onset, and 3 who had received prior antimicrobial therapy among the 5 neonates, 23 children, and 6 adults with bacterial meningitis. Organisms recovered from CSF, and/or blood, included Haemophilus influenzae 14, Streptococcus pneumoniae 9, Streptococcus group B-5, Staphylococcus aureus 2, E. coli 2 and Klebsiella pneumoniae 1. Slide test was positive for CRP in 33 cases, giving a sensitivity of 97% which compared favourably with elevated CSF protein 33%, decreased CFS glucose 64.7% CSF glucose/blood glucose less than 1/2, 85%, raised CSF WBC 38.2%, raised CSF PMN 61.7%, CSF culture positive 88.2%, and CSF gram-positive 82.5%. Slide test was positive for CRP in 1 of 78 CSF samples negative for bacterial meningitis, giving a specificity of 98%. It was concluded that testing of CSF for CRP is a simple, rapid and accurate method for the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, which is particularly appropriate for areas lacking adequate laboratory facilities.
TI  - Subcellular localization and further characterization of a new elastase inhibitor from pneumococci.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae contains an inhibitor of human neutrophil elastase. The  agent does not inhibit other proteases, including neutrophil cathepsin G and pancreatic elastase. It is active in the presence of insoluble elastin as well as synthetic elastase substrates. The inhibitor is present in the pneumococcal cell membrane. [125I]elastase binding studies and inhibition experiments with intact bacterial autoplasts suggest that this agent has its elastase-binding site(s) exposed on the outside of the bacterial cell membrane. Native and randomized membrane vesicles also show equal inhibitory activity. Active inhibitor can be solubilized from pneumococcal membranes by treatment with a dipolar ionic detergent and can then be reconstituted, in active form, within artificial liposomes. Complex formation between the neutrophil elastase inhibitor and neutrophil elastase may involve noncovalent associations. Although elastase containing a covalently bound substrate analog no longer binds the pneumococcal inhibitor, the present study shows that complex formation is nevertheless independent of neutrophil elastase catalytic activity. Specific inhibitor activity and inhibitor release during bile salt-stimulated autolysis are greater in a nonnecrotizing pneumococcal strain (type I) than they are in a necrotizing strain (type III) or in Klebsiella pneumoniae. These results may help explain the frequent resolution of some pneumococcal pneumonias, despite the presence in the early pneumonic exudate of many neutrophils containing an elastolytic protease capable of injuring lung connective tissue.
TI  - [Reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. The range of immunological specificity of Escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  - The antigenic specificity of E. coli M17 peptidoglycans (PG) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with PG opsonized with the whole and exhausted IgG fraction of human serum. Within the generic taxon, the PG under study were similar in their antigenic properties. The opsonic activity of IgG exhausted with the preparations of different E. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. An essential difference of E. coli PG from similar components of other representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. After the removal of antibodies to PG of remote taxons (Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). The results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of PG at different taxonomic levels.
TI  - Treatment of pneumonia with imipenem/cilastatin.
AB  - This pilot study assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerance of intravenously administered imipenem/cilastatin in the treatment of adults hospitalised with community acquired pneumonia. Thirteen patients were treated with 500 mg imipenem and 500 mg cilastatin eight hourly for a minimum of five days. Eleven patients (85%) had a clinical cure; (Legionella pneumophila was the pathogen in four, Streptococcus pneumoniae in one, Branhamella catarrhalis in one, no pathogen identified in five). One patient had a partial response (Staphylococcus aureus); and one patient was a treatment failure (Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella ozaenae). Clinical and laboratory side effects were mild, reversible and did not require treatment to be stopped. We conclude that the combination of imipenem and cilastatin was effective as a single agent in the treatment of the majority of these patients with hospital referred community acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in children with chronic liver disease: clinical features and etiologic factors.
AB  - We analyzed the clinical and bacteriologic features of 12 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in 11 children (four boys, median age 5.5 years) with chronic liver disease. All patients had cirrhosis and ascites; four had hypersplenism, and one was asplenic. Symptoms included increasing abdominal distention, pyrexia, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal disturbance, and encephalopathy. Nine had rebound tenderness on abdominal palpation, and 12 had reduced bowel sounds. The most frequent organisms isolated from culture of ascitic fluid were Streptococcus pneumoniae (nine). Klebsiella (two), and Haemophilus influenzae (one); blood cultures grew identical organisms in nine. Seven patients died despite intensive antibiotic therapy. In the 3 months prior to onset of SBP, defective yeast opsonization and reduced serum concentration of C4 were found in all nine children tested; eight had reduced concentration of C3. Functional deficiency of all complement components was present in four tested within 1 to 5 months of the onset. In contrast, only eight of 59 cirrhotic children without SBP had low C3, and eight had defective yeast opsonization, although 35 had low C4 values. Four of the patients with SBP and low C3 and C4 concentrations had normal concentrations at the time of diagnosis of liver disease 2 to 5 years previously. Opsonization of type III pneumococci was reduced in sera from three patients who subsequently developed pneumococcal peritonitis. The incidence of SBP in children with chronic liver disease is similar to that in adults, as are the clinical features. Our observations suggest that complement deficiency induced by chronic liver disease may be important in the pathogenesis of SBP.
TI  - [Distribution and changes in the susceptibility of bacteria isolated from clinical samples. II].
AB  - In vitro activity of antimicrobial agents such as ABPC, SBPC, MPC, CEZ, CTM, CMZ, CTX, CMX, CZX, LMOX, CPZ, CFS and GM against major clinical isolates, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, C. freundii, Enterobacter spp., S. marcescens, P. vulgaris and P. aeruginosa, was examined. In this paper, we will report the susceptibility of S. aureus, S. pyogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis during a three-year period, 1981 to approximately 1983. CEZ- and GM-resistant S. aureus has markedly increased and occupied 24% and 18%, respectively, in 1983. CMZ and CFS have showed potent activity against CEZ-resistant S. aureus. It seems that the abuse of third generation-cephems and new oral cephalosporins is closely related with the increase of cephems-resistant S. aureus. The penicillin- and cephem-resistant strains of S. pyogenes could not be found in our study. Quite a few strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are resistant to penicillins, and also there is no appreciable change in susceptibility. Some strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis showed low susceptibility to CPZ, but all strains showed high susceptibility and no change in susceptibility to third generations, and these strains showed no tendency to decrease in susceptibility to GM.
TI  - [Serum levels and sputum levels of cefmenoxime in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - In 11 patients with respiratory tract infections, the concentrations of cefmenoxime (CMX) in serum and sputum after 1 hour intravenous administration of 2 g of CMX were investigated. The peak serum level of CMX was 102.2 +/- 11.4 micrograms/ml after 1 hour drip infusion, then declined and was 3.51 +/- 0.55 micrograms/ml after 5 hours. Sputum level of CMX was lower than serum level but it was able to cover enough for MIC of Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and the peak sputum level of CMX was 0.77 +/- 0.17 micrograms/g after from 2 hours to 4 hours. Among the 11 patients with respiratory tract infections, 2 patients showed excellent, 6 patients good, 3 patients poor results (isolated organisms of sputum were normal flora) and no side effects observed.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of Sch 34343, a new penem antibiotic.
AB  - Using an agar dilution technique we examined the in-vitro activity of Sch 34343 against 485 clinical bacterial isolates. Ampicillin, mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, cefotetan, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) and gentamicin were used for comparison. Sch 34343 exhibited activity against all species tested, excepting Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas species. Unlike many newer beta-lactams, Sch 34343 was highly active against Gram-positive species. It was consistently active against the Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC50 and MIC90 being usually closely similar, as were results with two inoculum sizes (104 and 106 cfu). This, together with its activity against strains resistant to many other beta-lactam agents, suggested high stability to beta-lactamases. Sch 34343 was the most active compound tested against Bacteroides fragilis. In tests of combined bacteriostatic action with gentamicin no synergy was seen. It had bactericidal action in broth culture, against sensitive strains of E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. It showed good stability in aqueous solution and serum at low temperatures at pH values in the physiological range, and was moderately stable at 37 degrees C. Binding in human plasma was 72%. We concluded that Sch 34343 is a highly promising agent with a broad spectrum of activity making it potentially suitable as monotherapy for patients with infection of undetermined bacterial aetiology, particularly if Bact. fragilis is a possible pathogen.
TI  - [Antibiotic therapy of pneumopathies in intensive care and protected distal bronchial samples].
AB  - Bacteriology was performed on 57 specimens collected by the Wimberley protected catheter bronchoscopy technique (PCB) from 42 ventilated patients with severe head trauma hospitalized in the neurosurgical intensive care unit to determine the etiology of their pneumopathy. All patients had a nasotracheal tube upon arrival at the intensive care unit. For each sample, smears were examined and cultures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well as with CO2 were performed. In 34 (59%) of the 57 cases, examination of smears allowed rapid diagnosis and appropriate chemotherapy. In 47 (82%) cases, culture was positive, with a single pathogen being recovered in half of cases. The most prevalent organisms among the 75 species isolated were S. aureus (38%), P. aeruginosa (15%), Klebsiella (12%), Haemophilus (8%), and Pneumococcus (9%). Consistency with positive cultures of blood or pleural effusion samples was recorded in 92% of cases. Narrow spectrum antibiotic therapy can be chosen according to the results of PCB bacteriology and rapid automated antibiotic sensitivity testing obtained within 24 hours. PCB is therefore recommended in pulmonary infections in intensive care units.
TI  - [Bronchial diffusion of piperacillin in 18 intensive care patients].
AB  - Eighteen patients (13 under mechanical ventilation) in an intensive care unit received piperacillin for pneumonia (7 cases) or bronchial infection (11 cases), related to Haemophilus influenzae (7), Streptococcus pneumoniae (4) or miscellaneous pathogens (7) including Staphylococcus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Each patient was given 2g piperacillin intravenously every six hours. Concentrations in serum and bronchial secretion samples were assayed by the agar diffusion technique using a susceptible strain of Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633. Maximum concentrations were 157 micrograms/ml in serum and 3.60 micrograms/ml in bronchial secretions. These results are similar to those obtained with the same dosage by 0. Cars in serum (150 micrograms/ml) and by G.E. Marlin in the bronchial secretions (3.78 micrograms/ml). They approximate those published for other penicillins with the same dosage.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a new N-sulfonated monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of carumonam (AMA-1080), a synthetic sulfazecin derivative, were compared with those of aztreonam, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and cefsulodin. Carumonam was highly active in vitro against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Haemophilus influenzae and weakly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, but it was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. The MICs of carumonam for 90% of 1,156 clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates were between 0.013 and 25 micrograms/ml, which were the lowest MICs of the antibiotics tested. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of Klebsiella oxytoca was 0.2 micrograms/ml, whereas that of aztreonam was 50 micrograms/ml. The superiority of carumonam to aztreonam and the reference cephalosporins was also demonstrated by their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. The MIC of carumonam for 90% of P. aeruginosa was 12.5 micrograms/ml, which was comparable to the MICs of aztreonam and ceftazidime. Carumonam showed a high affinity for the penicillin-binding protein 3 of gram-negative bacteria, but not for the penicillin-binding proteins of S. aureus and Bacteroides fragilis. Carumonam was resistant to hydrolysis by 12 plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and 7 chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the beta-lactamase of K. oxytoca; this stability is related to the superiority of the in vitro and in vivo activities of carumonam to those of aztreonam against this species. In general, the protective activities (50% effective dose) of carumonam and reference antibiotics in mice with experimental intraperitoneal infections correlated with the in vitro activities (MIC); carumonam showed excellent protective activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Induction of increased antibody responses to pneumococcal type 19F polysaccharide by Klebsiella polysaccharide.
AB  - The level of antibody to pneumococcal 19F polysaccharide (PS) was studied in the  serum of mice inoculated with klebsiella K2 PS or pneumococcal 19F PS or both. The serum antibody levels and the IgM plaque-forming-cell (PFC) response after immunization were higher in mice given both K2 PS and 19F PS than in mice of a control group given 19F PS alone. This immune response was also higher than the sum of PFC production in mice given 19F PS or K2 PS separately. Thus, K2 PS produced the cross-reactive antibody to 19F PS and also enhanced the magnitude of the antibody response to 19F PS. This response appeared to be specific for the 19F PS. The resulting high levels of antibody to pneumococcal 19F persisted for eight weeks after the administration of K2 PS and 19F PS. Animals immunized with both type 3 PS and K2 PS did not show an increased antibody response to pneumococcal type 3 PS. Klebsiella K-O3 antigen also stimulated the immune response to 19F PS. Higher immunologic responses to 19F PS were also induced in nude mice injected with the cross-reacting K2 PS or K47 PS and 19F PS. The ability to stimulate an antibody response to 19F PS by administering both K2 PS and 19F PS could not be transferred with spleen cells obtained from mice given both K2 PS and 19F PS.
TI  - In vitro studies on the antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of YM-13115, a new parenteral cephalosporin, were compared with those of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin. The compound was highly active against the common members of the Enterobacteriaceae and 2 to 256 times more active than cefoperazone. YM-13115 was as active as ceftazidime against Citrobacter freundii, Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii and two to four times more active than ceftazidime against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia rettgeri, and Providencia stuartii. The activity of YM-13115 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.78 and 3.13 micrograms/ml for 50 and 90% of the isolates, respectively) was ca. 2 times that of ceftazidime, 4 times that of cefsulodin, and 16 times that of cefoperazone. Against Haemophilus influenzae YM-13115 was more active than ceftazidime. YM-13115 was less active than ceftazidime, cefoperazone, and cefsulodin against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The concentrations of YM-13115 required to inhibit the growth of 90% of the isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.78 and 1.56 microgram/ml, respectively, but concentrations above 100 micrograms/ml were required to inhibit Streptococcus faecalis. YM-13115 was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. YM-13115 is extremely active against P. aeruginosa and members of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Effects of toluene inhalation on pulmonary host defenses of mice.
AB  - The potential hazards of exposure to vapor-phase toluene on pulmonary host defenses were evaluated. Mice exposed to concentrations ranging from 2.5-500 ppm, including the threshold limit value level of 100 ppm, exhibited increased susceptibility to respiratory infection with Streptococcus zooepidemicus. The no-measurable-effect level for single, as well as for 5 exposures was 1 ppm. Significantly decreased pulmonary bactericidal activity was observed after single exposures to 500, 250, 100 and 2.5 ppm toluene, and after 5 daily 3-h exposures to 1.0 ppm of toluene. A 20-exposure study with toluene at 1 ppm produced no changes in either of the 2 assays.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the pancreatic fluid.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of canine pancreatic fluid was investigated in an attempt to understand the resistance of this organ, when intact, to ascending bacterial infections. The pancreatic fluid demonstrated bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Shigella species, Salmonella species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae; bacteriostatic activity against coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and fungistatic activity against Candida albicans. There was no demonstrable antibacterial activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Streptococcus faecalis. The antibacterial activity was dialyzable and pH dependent, but independent of heat, the activity of several digestive pancreatic enzymes, and the bacterial inoculum. Electron micrographs of Escherichia coli exposed to pancreatic fluid did not demonstrate changes in the bacterial cell wall. Tracer studies of susceptible bacteria demonstrated decreased leucine uptake when briefly exposed to pancreatic fluid. The antibacterial activity was found by column chromatography to be a small molecular peptide. It is likely that pancreatic antibacterial factors protect the pancreas from ascending bacterial infections and operate along with other factors in the homeostasis of the upper small bowel flora.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of DN-9550, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - DN-9550 [(6R, 7R)-7-[(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-pyridinio)methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia -1-azabicyclo methyl]-8-oxo-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-2-carboxylate hydrochloride] is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The activity of DN-9550 against most species of the family Enterobacteriaceae was roughly comparable to that of ceftazidime, slightly lower than that of cefotaxime, and far exceeded that of cefoperazone. Against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens, DN-9550 was more active than ceftazidime and cefotaxime. DN-9550 and ceftazidime were significantly more active than cefotaxime against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but DN-9550 and cefotaxime were clearly more active than ceftazidime against staphylococci and streptococci. Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were also highly susceptible to DN-9550, but Bacteroides fragilis was generally not susceptible to the compound. DN-9550 was stable to various types of beta-lactamases and had high affinities for penicillin-binding protein 3 of both Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. When DN-9550 was administered subcutaneously to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, its efficacy well reflected its in vitro potency.
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - The pharmacokinetics and serum and urine bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin is an investigational quinolone agent possessing an impressive antibacterial spectrum. Its pharmacokinetics were studied in six volunteers after 250-mg and 500-mg single oral doses, and its bactericidal activity compared to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole given to the same volunteers. Mean peak serum levels were 1.45 micrograms/mL and 2.46 micrograms/mL for 250-mg and 500-mg doses, and time to peak was 1 and 1.3 hours. The 12-hour levels were 0.12 micrograms and 0.22 microgram. Half-life (T1/2)alpha were 0.32 and 0.43 with T1/2 beta were 3.97 and 4.15 and volume of distribution (area) were 80L and 90L, respectively. Area under the concentration curve (AUC) was 5.65 h X micrograms/mL and 10.37h X micrograms/mL. Serum clearance was 23L for both doses. Approximately 49% of the 250-mg dose and 43% of the 500-mg dose was recovered in the urine. Bactericidal levels were determined against clinical isolates. Sera at 1.5 hours after the 500-mg dose averaged bactericidal levels of 1:20 or better for an Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. Urinary bactericidal levels at eight to 12 hours were greater than or equal to 1:157 for E coli, K pneumoniae, gentamicin-piperacillin resistant P aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and 1:20 for Streptococcus faecalis. Serum bactericidal levels were superior, and urine bactericidal levels were superior or equal to the bactericidal levels obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Dynamics of resistance to cephalosporins.
AB  - Bacterial susceptibility to various cephalosporins of nine of the most frequently isolated organisms were analyzed for the five-year period 1980 to 1984. The disk diffusion susceptibility to cephalosporins of 1,640,031 strains of bacteria isolated from 242 hospitals in the United States were compared. No significant change has occurred in the susceptibility of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Streptococcus faecalis for this period; Enterobacter aerogenes showed a slight decrease in susceptibility to moxalactam, cephalothin, cefoxitin and cefamandole. Slight increases in susceptibility were observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cefotaxime and moxalactam and for Bacteroides fragilis to cefoxitin and cefamandole. Staphylococcus aureus showed slight decreases in susceptibility to cefoperazone and ceftizoxime and slight increase to moxalactam.
TI  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria measured by flow cytometry.
AB  - Phagocytosis by human leukocytes, phagosomal pH and degradation of seven species  of bacteria were studied by a flow cytometric method. The percentage of phagocytosing leukocytes was similar for all bacterial strains examined, but Salmonella typhi and Neisseria meningitidis were more slowly phagocytosed than other bacteria. The phagosomal pH surrounding the different bacterial species 15 min after the start of phagocytosis were: Streptococcus pneumoniae 4.4; N. meningitidis 4.9; Str. pyogenes 5.1; Staphylococcus aureus 5.2; Escherichia coli 5.3; S. typhi 5.4; and Klebsiella pneumoniae 5.7. For longer incubation periods, the phagosomal pH remained nearly constant. Staph. aureus, E. coli and S. typhi were the most readily degraded of the species tested. The proteins of all bacteria were degraded more rapidly than their DNA as determined by measurements of the loss of fluorescein-isothiocyanate-fluorescence and ethidium bromide-fluorescence, respectively. The rate of degradation varied from one bacterial species to another. The degradation of proteins and DNA was maximal for bacteria residing in a phagosomal environment estimated to be between pH 5.2 and 5.4.
TI  - Lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in B27-associated arthropathies.
AB  - Lymphocyte transformation tests to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease and controls. Ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/Reiter's to Yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to S. faecalis (p = 0.008). It appears, therefore, that within the B27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/Reiter's disease.
TI  - [Protective activity of a cell-free Klebsiella vaccine in infection in mice caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes].
AB  - The capacity of dried Klebsiella cell-free vaccine, obtained from strain No. 204  by the disintegration of microbial mass with hydroxylamine, for protecting mice from pneumococcal infection caused by S. pneumoniae, serotypes 3, 4 and 9N, has been studied. Klebsiella vaccine has been found to possess immunostimulating potency with respect to the S. pneumoniae serotypes under study. On day 5 this potency is manifested to a greater extent than 24 hours after immunization. The combination of Klebsiella vaccine with Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli K-100 antigens enhances the stimulation of nonspecific resistance.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the effect of cefotaxime in senile pneumonia caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - 66 patients with predominantly community-acquired pneumonia were treated with cefotaxime. The group consisted of 45 males and 21 females, aged 56 to 90 years, 43 of the patients belonging to the age groups 65-80 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 21 of the 34 patients with gram-positive pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus in six, Staphylococcus epidermidis in five and Streptococcus faecalis in two. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen in gram-negative pneumonia (eight patients), followed by Enterobacter (n = 6), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n = 4), Escherichia coli (n = 3), Serratia marcescens and Citrobacter (two cases each). The in vitro activity of cefotaxime against the isolates was compared to the activity of other beta-lactam antibiotics. Characteristically, the classical signs and symptoms of pneumonia were absent or discrete in some of the elderly patients. There was a delayed clearance of pulmonary infiltrates. 55 of 66 patients responded to cefotaxime within four weeks of treatment; the symptoms were aggravated or remained unchanged in seven patients. Patients with a delayed clinical response displayed decreased peripheral lymphocyte counts and T cell functions in PHA stimulation tests, as well as low immunoglobulin levels. A combination of cefotaxime and gamma-venin cleared the symptoms in some of these patients.
TI  - Selection of an aminoglycoside antibiotic for administration to horses.
AB  - The serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides neomycin, kanamycin and streptomycin were determined after intravenous (iv) and intramuscular (im) administration. These values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean (+/- sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 +/- 10.2 micrograms/ml present at 30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 +/- 0.8 micrograms/ml. From the pharmacological analysis of concentration-time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the im injection site, with an absorption half-time of 0.16 +/- 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7 +/- 26.9 per cent). A peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug. At 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. Based on the MIC values of the majority of isolates of Corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 micrograms neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/kg) to be therapeutically effective.
TI  - Detection of beta-lactamase activity with nitrocefin of multiple strains of various microbial genera.
AB  - The production or presence of beta-lactamase(s) was studied by the rapid method utilizing the chromogenic cephalosporin compound nitrocefin in cultures of multiple strains belonging to the same genus as well as groups of microorganisms. The genera were: Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, rare Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. With this sensitive and rapid assay for beta-lactamase, it was possible to verify and separate the beta-lactamase producing cultures from the non-producers and include the useful strains to on-going research, such as beta-lactam screen, beta-lactamase inhibitory study and lytic properties of beta-lactams. The data also provide evidence for the possible role of beta-lactamase(s) in the physiology, biochemistry and pathogenicity of bacterial strains. The nitrocefin method was found a very specific and extremely useful procedure for the detection and estimation of beta-lactamase activity.
TI  - [Evaluation of bacterial growth rate by the ATP-bioluminescence method (luciferase assay)--comparison with conventional methods and application to clinical studies].
AB  - Bacterial growth rate was evaluated by estimating the increase in ATP content of  cultures of bacterial suspensions using luciferase assay, and the method was applied to the estimation of bactericidal activity of serum and anti-bacterial activity of antibiotics. The results obtained were as follows: The bacterial numbers or bacterial growth rate determined by the ATP-Bioluminescence method was in accordance with those by CFU assay and spectrometrical assay by optical density readings. Furthermore this method was confirmed to be non-time-consuming and more simple than other methods. Using this method, anti-bacterial activity of fresh serum was evaluated. The serum suppressed the growth rate of E. coli, Str. fecalis, CBS, Kleb. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus at least for 2 hours. Heat-inactivated serum and absorbed serum with bacteria tended to lose such suppressive effect. Thus the main effective factors seem to be complements and specific antibody. The anti-microbial activity of antibiotics was enhanced by addition of fresh serum to bacterial cultures, and the results were not in accordance with those by the conventional Disc method. Thus the sensitivity test under the influence of fresh serum is recommended in order to know the clinical effect of antibiotics. These results suggest the usefulness of ATP-Bioluminescence method in the clinical laboratory examinations or investigations.
TI  - Temocillin treatment of serious infections due to gram-negative bacilli in an intensive care unit.
AB  - In a group of 27 severely ill patients in an intensive care unit, 40 infections caused by Gram-negative bacilli were treated with temocillin 2g twice daily by the direct intravenous route. The patients (17 men and 10 women) were aged from 35 to 93 years (mean 65.7 years) and 22 had severe underlying diseases. In addition, 10 of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit following surgery; 6 had acute renal insufficiency, 5 had acute respiratory insufficiency, and 12 were suffering from infectious shock. The infections included septicaemia (19), urinary tract infection (10), respiratory tract infection (4) and biliary tract infection (4). The most frequent bacterial isolate was Escherichia coli (14), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5), Proteus spp. (5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4). The initial pathogens were eliminated in 34/40 infections (85%) and the corresponding clinical cure rate was 60%, with a further 27.5% of patients being improved. In the septicaemic patients, 17/19 pathogens were eradicated from the blood, while clinically, 12 patients were cured and 5 were improved. Eight of the 10 urinary tract pathogens were eliminated, with 6 patients being clinically cured and a further 3 being improved. All of the initial pathogens in both biliary tract and respiratory tract infections were eradicated, accompanied by clinical success in 3 and 2 patients, respectively; the remaining patients were improved. Superinfection with streptococcus group D, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus was seen in 3 patients. The emergence of resistance to temocillin occurred in an isolate of E. coli, and also possibly in an isolate of K. pneumoniae. No adverse reactions nor abnormal laboratory values related to temocillin administration were observed and, although 7 patients died, none of the deaths were attributable to uncontrolled Gram-negative infection.
TI  - [Criteria and methods of etiological diagnosis of acute and chronic inflammatory  processes in the lungs].
AB  - The clinical, bacteriological, cytological, serological and allergological data were analyzed in 376 patients with acute pneumonia and chronic bronchitis to study the diagnostic importance of the microorganisms isolated from the sputum. The informativeness of the methods was estimated by correlation of the appropriate data with the data of the final verified diagnosis of the inflammatory process in the lungs. Bacterioscopy of the sputum smear stained according to Gram, bioassay on mice, determination of bacterial concentration per ml sputum, allergic tests with bacterial allergens were found to be the most reliable methods as regards the etiological diagnosis of acute pneumonias. It should be mentioned that bacterioscopy is an early criterion of the disease etiology. Criteria of the etiological significance of bacteria which cause exacerbation of chronic bronchitis encompass the measurement of bacterial concentration per ml sputum, indirect immunofluorescence with autostrains of the isolated bacteria and the bioassay. Early criteria include the first two methods.
TI  - Asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy with special reference to group B streptococci.
AB  - The relationship between significant bacteriuria (SB), i.e. 2 subsequent voided urine specimens with greater than or equal to 10(5) colony forming units (CFU)/ml, and the occurrence of bacteria in the urinary bladder detected by bladder punction, was investigated in asymptomatic pregnant women. From 30 (70%) of the 43 women with SB studied, bacteria were isolated from the urinary bladder. The same bacteria were found in the bladders of all 21 women with Escherichia coli, the one with Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the one with Staphylococcus saprophyticus in midstream urine. Six of 10 patients with group B streptococci (GBS), 1 of 4 patients with Streptococcus faecalis, and none of 5 patients with Staphylococcus epidermidis in voided specimens had bacteria in the aspirated urine. Serotype III was isolated from 8/10 patients with SB caused by GBS. One child born to a woman with GBS SB but no bacteria in the urinary bladder, got early onset septicaemia. The poor predictive value of SB with GBS, S. faecalis and S. epidermidis necessitates the increased use of bladder puncture for diagnosis of true asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB), i.e. AB with bacteria in the urinary bladder. SB with GBS even without bacteria in the urinary bladder, may constitute a threat to the baby's health.
TI  - Human serum amyloid P component, a circulating lectin with specificity for the cyclic 4,6-pyruvate acetal of galactose. Interactions with various bacteria.
AB  - Serum amyloid P component (SAP), a normal plasma glycoprotein, has recently been  shown to have Ca2+-dependent binding specificity for methyl 4,6-O-(1-carboxyethylidene)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (MO beta DG) [Hind, Collins, Renn, Cook, Caspi, Baltz & Pepys (1984) J. Exp. Med. 159, 1058-1069]. SAP was found to bind in vitro to Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, the cell wall of which is known to contain this particular cyclic pyruvate acetal of galactose. SAP also bound in similar amounts (approx. 6000 molecules per organism) to group A Streptococcus pyogenes, but very much less was taken up on Xanthomonas campestris, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of mannose. No SAP bound to Escherichia coli, which contains the 4,6-cyclic pyruvate acetal of glucose, or to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 4, which contains the 2,3-cyclic pyruvate acetal of alpha- rather than beta-galactopyranoside, or to other organisms (Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis), the carbohydrate structures of which are less well characterized. Binding of SAP to those organisms which it did recognize was completely inhibited or reversed by millimolar concentrations of free MO beta DG. SAP, a human plasma protein, thus behaves as a lectin and may be a useful probe for its particular specific ligand in the cell walls of bacteria and other organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of norfloxacin and seven other antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates from urinary tract infections.
AB  - The in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a new quinolone derivative, was tested against 469 clinical isolates derived mainly from urinary samples from outpatients. It inhibited all Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Proteus strains at a concentration of 0.25 micrograms/ml, and all Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus strains at a concentration of 8 micrograms/ml or less. Norfloxacin proved to be more effective than nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, mecillinam and nitrofurantoin against all gram-negative rods tested.
TI  - Cefmenoxime: clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cefmenoxime was evaluated in an open trial consisting of 41 patients. Forty infections in 36 patients could be evaluated. Thirteen patients had pyelonephritis due to Escherichia coli (two bacteremic), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Streptococcus faecalis; all improved and 12 of 13 were clinically cured, but one relapse (S. faecalis) occurred at two weeks. Six patients with cystitis due to E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, P. aeruginosa, or S. faecalis all improved, but relapse or reinfection, or both, occurred in five due to P. aeruginosa, S. faecalis, C. fruendii, or E. coli. Neurogenic bladder or other complications were present in five of 13 patients with pyelonephritis and five of six with cystitis. Ten patients with pneumonia and one with tracheobronchitis due to Hemophilus influenzae, S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, or Neisseria meningitidis all improved and seven had resolution without relapse, but P. aeruginosa emerged in two patients, one of whom died. Eight soft tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Peptococcus prevotti, Streptococcus species, or infections of mixed origin resolved in six. Sterility of blood cultures was obtained in one patient with endocarditis due to S. anginosus, but other therapy was substituted. Clinical resolution of the toxic shock syndrome and subsequent negative endocervical cultures for S. aureus occurred in one. Granulocytopenia of unverified cause in four (with less than 1,500 mm3) and two (with less than 2,000 mm3) was reversible. Headache during treatment occurred in six patients and a possible disulfiram-like effect in three. Elevations of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and alkaline phosphatase occurred in five, Coombs' positivity in two, and diarrhea in three. Clinical efficacy of cefmenoxime was significant. Possible side effects require further study.
TI  - Evaluation of experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid by excised teat assay.
AB  - An experimental teat dip containing sodium chlorite and lactic acid, diluted in water, was evaluated by excised teat protocol. The teat dip was tested against 21 microorganisms. Included were: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Numerous strains were tested for strain differences. Environmental bacteria were included because of their increasing importance as a cause of bovine mastitis. All excised teats were dipped in a bacterial suspension containing about 1 X 10(8) cfu/ml. Negative control teats were not dipped in a germicidal compound. Positive controls were dipped in 1% iodophor. Effectiveness of the experimental teat dip was expressed as the percent reduction in mean log of bacteria recovered from dipped teats as compared to numbers recovered from control teats. The sodium chlorite - lactic acid dip caused a greater percent log reduction than iodophor for 14 of 21 strains tested. However, differences were generally slight. The experimental teat dip appeared effective against Gram-negative bacteria. Some differences in percent log reduction were observed between strains of the same species. Lowest effectiveness and greatest strain variation were observed with Staphylococcus aureus for both dips tested.
TI  - Pharmacokinetic and experimental data on beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of patients.
AB  - The in vitro and animal model studies on optimal dosage of the newer beta-lactams are summarized and put into historical perspective. They provide a rationale for dosage schedules that continuously maintain inhibitory serum and tissue concentrations throughout the dosage interval. In vitro studies on the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) with beta-lactams revealed only short time periods of post-antibiotic growth suppression with gram-positive cocci and no post-antibiotic effect with gram-negative bacilli. A similar lack of persistent growth suppression was observed with beta-lactams in a neutropenic mouse thigh infection model for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In the same animal model, dosing regimens of beta-lactams which continuously provided serum concentrations above the MIC were more efficacious than those that did not. The newer third-generation cephalosporins have prolonged half-lives and can maintain serum levels above the MIC for most pathogens, even when dosed at widely spaced intervals.
TI  - Spenolimycin, a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic. III. Biological properties.
AB  - Spenolimycin is a new spectinomycin-type antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces gilvospiralis sp. nov. In vitro, it was active against a wide variety of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It was two to four-fold more active against N. gonorrhoeae than spectinomycin. Spenolimycin was effective in the standard mouse protection test against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - The relevance of arterial wall microbiology to the treatment of prosthetic graft  infections: graft infection vs. arterial infection.
AB  - One potential, but poorly studied source for intraoperative contamination of vascular grafts is the native artery to which the prosthetic graft is attached. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between arterial wall microbiology and graft infection. Between July 1, 1981, and March 31, 1982, arterial specimens were cultured from 88 (30%) of 298 patients undergoing clean, elective arterial reconstructive procedures. Control cultures were obtained from adjacent adipose or lymph node tissue. Positive cultures were obtained from 38 of 88 (43%) of the arterial walls cultured but from none of the control cultures (0 of 20) (p less than 0.001). The most common organism cultured was Staphylococcus epidermidis (27 of 38; 71%). Our overall graft infection rate since January 1, 1981, is 0.9% (3 of 335). All three graft infections occurred in patients with positive arterial cultures. Arterial and graft cultures were also obtained from 20 patients treated for 22 graft infections over the past 13 years. Organisms recovered included staphylococcal species (36%), enteric organisms (46%), and mixtures of the two (18%). These patients with culture-positive graft infections were divided retrospectively into two groups: those with positive and those with negative arterial cultures. Positive arterial cultures were associated with suture line disruption in 8 of 14 cases (57%), but there were no arterial disruptions in patients with negative cultures (0 of 8) (p less than 0.01). These data document a significant correlation between positive arterial wall cultures and subsequent prosthetic infection and also suggest that infection involving the arterial wall is a major determinant of the morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment of prosthetic graft sepsis.
TI  - Immediate postmortem cultures in an intensive care nursery.
AB  - The results of several published studies suggest that bacterial infection plays an important role in the mortality of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. To evaluate more thoroughly this role we have routinely performed postmortem cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid on all infants who die in our NICU. During a 5-year review period 25.9% of infants who died had one or both cultures positive for an organism considered to be pathogenic in the neonate. The organisms most commonly cultured were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus. Of those infants who had positive postmortem cultures and who had an autopsy, 95% had histologic evidence of infection. Forty-three percent of our infants with positive postmortem cultures were not suspected of having a serious infection and had not received antibiotics before death. Postmortem cultures appeared to be helpful in identifying NICU patients in whom serious infection may have played a role in mortality. Unsuspected serious infection is a common finding in infants who die in a neonatal intensive care setting.
TI  - Endogenous infection in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. A feature of bacterial translocation.
AB  - Slc:ddY mice that received a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) were examined for persistency of diabetes (changes of indigenous bacterial floras, and bacterial translocation. Significant diabetes (increase in plasma glucose and decrease in insulin) was recognized 2 weeks after the injection, and persisted for 12 weeks. The numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci (including micrococci), and streptococci in caecal and oral floras were significantly increased, but the numbers of anaerobic bacteria in caecal flora were hardly changed. Bacterial translocation of indigenous bacteria to the mesenteric lymph node, lung, or kidney was detectable in some mice 2 weeks after the injection. The incidence of bacterial translocation in these STZ-treated mice then increased; infection caused by several organisms, e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococci, or Lactobacillus sp., occurred in lung, liver, spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph node. No indigenous bacteria were cultured from these organs of control mice. This endogenous infection may have been due to the over population of several bacterial strains caused by disruption of indigenous floras along with depression of immunological function.
TI  - [Study of lincomycin concentrations in hepatocystic duct].
AB  - Penetration of lincomycin (LCM) in choledochal and cholecystic bile as well as in the gallbladder tissue and liver tissue was investigated together with bacteria detectable in the bile in order to evaluate basically usefulness of this antibiotic in the treatment of infections of the hepatocystic duct. Intravenous drip infusion of LCM 1.5 g (in 500 ml of 5% glucose solution) over 1.5--2 hours resulted in mean drug concentrations of 33.9 and 10.1 micrograms/ml in serum at 2 and 4 hours post start of infusion respectively; 215.5 micrograms/ml in choledochal bile at 3 hours 15 minutes; 252.7 micrograms/ml in cholecystic bile at 3 hours 36 minutes; 28.1 micrograms/g in gallbladder tissue at 2 hours 55 minutes; and 15.4 micrograms/g in liver tissue at 4 hours. A cross-over study of LCM and cefazolin (CEZ) in 2 cases where T-tubes were employed demonstrated evidently higher biliary levels of LCM than CEZ. Bacteriological examination showed that Hafnia alvei plus Streptococcus faecalis were presented in choledochal bile from just 1 of 4 cases while in cholecystic bile from 9 of 15 cases were detected 22 strains of organisms including Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (5), Escherichia coli (2), Citrobacter freundii (2) and Serratia marcescens (2). A total of 7 strains of anaerobes including B. fragilis was isolated. The above concentrations of LCM in the bile, gallbladder tissue and liver tissue sufficiently covered the MIC90 of this antibiotic determined by us in 1980 for major species of anaerobes including clinical isolates of B. fragilis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Successive extraction of specific protective immunoglobulins from pooled human sera.
AB  - By use of pooled human sera, specific protective immunoglobulins against the Smith-diffuse strain of Staphylococcus aureus, strains SS-620 and SS-619 of types III and II group B streptococci, and strain K-9 of Klebsiella pneumoniae were successively extracted from their whole cell and antibody complexes by elution with propionic acid containing 5% sucrose. Injection of 0.14, 0.05, 0.09, and 0.15 mg of these eluates in mice gave protection against lethal infection only with homologous strains. However, no protective effect was observed against these infections, even with considerably higher amounts of a conventional immunoglobulin preparation. The major components of the eluates were the three major immunoglobulins, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM, although nonspecific proteins were also included. Protective activities of these eluates were absorbed out by their protection-inducing antigens, indicating that they contained specific protective immunoglobulins.
TI  - Treatment of 160 cases of acute bacterial meningitis with cefotaxime.
AB  - One hundred and sixty cases of acute bacterial meningitis were treated with cefotaxime. Patients were between 9 days and 79 years old: 7 new borns, 37 infants, 43 children, 19 adolescents and 54 adults. Fifty-eight patients (36%) were in coma when admitted. Aetiology was determined in 110 patients (68.8%): Neisseria meningitidis in 42, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 36, Haemophilus influenzae in 16, Salmonella spp. in 7, Staphylococcus aureus in 2, Enterobacter spp. in 2 and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae in one patient each. All isolates were sensitive to cefotaxime, with MIC's for 26 strains ranging from 0.01 to 0.50 mg/l. One hundred and fifty-six of the 160 patients were treated with cefotaxime alone and the four others with cefotaxime in association with an aminoglycoside in three and rifampicin in one. Cefotaxime was administered by intravenous infusion, in a daily dose 100 to 300 mg/kg. Duration of treatment ranged from 8 days to 6 weeks, with a mean of 15 days. One hundred and forty-nine patients (93.1%) were cured, two after a relapse. Three patients had sequelae. Most (88.5%) had sterile CSF within 72 h after starting treatment. Eleven patients (6.9%) died, eight within the first 48 h. The only side-effects observed were mild transient eosinophilia in some patients and rash and leukopenia in 2 each. The study demonstrates that cefotaxime is effective in the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of FR 17027, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  - FR 17027, a new orally absorbed cephalosporin ester, inhibited group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the inhibition concentration of amoxicillin and cefaclor, and was more active than cephalexin. It was less active (MIC, 25 micrograms/ml) against staphylococci than was cephalexin, and it did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria monocytogenes. FR 17027 inhibited beta-lactamase-producing isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Branhamella catarrhalis at less than 0.1 micrograms/ml and was more active than cefaclor or cephalexin against these bacteria. FR 17027 inhibited Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Providencia stuartii, Providencia rettgeri, and Citrobacter diversus at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, including isolated resistant to amoxicillin, cephalexin, and cefaclor, but it was less active than ceftizoxime. Some strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes were resistant (MIC, greater than 25 micrograms/ml). FR 17027 did not inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other Pseudomonas species, Acinetobacter species, or Bacteroides species. Activity was minimally affected by growth conditions. FR 17027 was not hydrolyzed by the common beta-lactamases present in many of the pathogens causing respiratory and urinary tract infections in outpatients.
TI  - Canine urinary tract infections: a comparison of in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results and response to oral therapy with ampicillin or with trimethoprim-sulfa.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of ampicillin therapy in all 56 urinary tract infections (UTI) caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus and S intermedius), in all 26 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 38 of 44 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 29 of 31 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 8 of 10 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and in 16 of 20 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 173 of 187 (92.5%) isolates responded to ampicillin therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results. In vitro susceptibility testing correctly predicted the outcome of therapy with trimethoprim-sulfa in 119 of 138 UTI caused by Escherichia coli, in 33 of 45 UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, in 38 of 43 UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, in 21 of 25 UTI caused by Streptococcus spp, in 9 of 11 UTI caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci, and in 19 of 21 UTI caused by other bacterial species. Thus, 239 of 283 (84%) isolates responded to trimethoprim-sulfa therapy in a manner predicted by in vitro susceptibility test results.
TI  - Thymidine kinase of bacteria: activity of the enzyme in actinomycetes and related organisms.
AB  - Various micro-organisms were studied for their thymidine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.21) (TK) activity. The sonicated cell extract of Escherichia coli K12 had a TK activity of 35-66 pmol thymidine monophosphate formed min-1 (mg protein)-1. The cell extracts of Salmonella typhimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae showed a markedly higher (5- to 11-fold) TK activity. Somewhat lower but significant TK activity was detected in the cell extracts of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. In contrast, weak TK activity, if any, was detected in the cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This was also the case with respect to the cell extracts of various actinomycetes (such as Nocardia and Streptomyces) and related organisms (such as Corynebacterium, Mycobacterium and Rhodococcus).
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1982)].
AB  - Two hundred seventy-six bacterial strains were isolated as possible causative pathogens mainly from sputum in 248 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in various parts of Japan during the period from September 1982 to March 1983. Of these, 272 isolates including 28 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 38 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 107 Haemophilus influenzae strains, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 9 Escherichia coli strains and 5 strains of other species were tested in vitro for MICs of various antibiotics, and their drug sensitivity distributions determined. Data were also analyzed for distribution of cases by clinical entities, age and sex, interrelations between the types of infections and the species and frequency of isolation of organisms, and relations of the antimicrobial regimens at collection of clinical specimens to the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms. It engenders great interest that there was a significant increase in frequency of S. aureus isolation within 7 days after antibiotic therapy, compared to pretreatment isolation frequency, in the 1982 series. This seems to deserve further investigation in detail. The H. influenzae strains isolated with the highest frequency in 1981 and those in 1982 were examined as to susceptibility to several representative antibiotics, with interdrug comparisons: ABPC vs. SBPC, CTM vs. CMZ, and CMX vs. LMOX. The isolates demonstrated high degrees of susceptibility to these drugs and there was no conspicuous change in bacterial sensitivity to the drugs.
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vivo activity of cefodizime (HR 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (CTX), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (CMZ). The protective effects of HR 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Escherichia coli C-11, Proteus vulgaris GN-76 and Serratia marcescens No. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. In contrast, the compound showed the smallest ED50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including CMZ), for Klebsiella pneumoniae 3K-25 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ED50 for Citrobacter freundii GN-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its MIC of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. HR 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae Sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. When tested against the E. coli Ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of HR 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of CTX or CMZ given at the same dose twice daily.
TI  - Hematoporphyrin-sensitized photoinactivation of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  
TI  - An extended model for transfer of micro-organisms via the hands: differences between organisms and the effect of alcohol disinfection.
AB  - A model for contact transfer of micro-organisms by hand has been extended to include representatives of bacterial species responsible for a majority of hospital-acquired infections. The ability of the organisms to transfer from contaminated fabrics to hands and from hands to sterile fabrics was measured, as was their ability to survive on the skin of the hands. There were differences between the species. Staphylococcus saprophyticus transferred well to the hand but not as well from hand to fabric as the other species; it survived well on skin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella aerogenes and Serratia marcescens transferred moderately well overall and also survived on the skin. These results were in contrast to those obtained with a strain of Escherichia coli and one of Streptococcus pyogenes. The contact transfer model was used to investigate the use of small volumes of alcohol in preventing transfer via the hands. An alcohol handrub of either 0.3 ml 80% ethanol or 0.3 ml 70% isopropanol gave reductions in transfer slightly less than that of a soap and water wash. Raising the volume, and consequently the contact time, to 0.5 ml 70% isopropanol gave a 14000-fold reduction in transfer, statistically indistinguishable from that of a thorough soap and water wash (9800-fold reduction).
TI  - Use of the Becton-Dickinson urine culture tube with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system.
AB  - Urine specimens were obtained from 312 obstetric outpatients by sterile midstream technique and aliquots placed in both Becton-Dickinson urine culture tubes and sterile conventional tubes. Quantitative cultures were made from each tube, and each tube was screened for bacteria with the Abbott MS-2 urine screening system. The time required to detect bacteriuria was recorded for both specimens. Isolates from specimens containing greater than or equal to 50,000/ml gram-positive cocci or greater than or equal to 100,000/ml gram-negative bacilli were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility tests performed. Delayed (24 hr) quantitative cultures were done from Becton-Dickinson tubes. By these criteria, 124 urine specimens were positive in both conventional and Becton-Dickinson tubes. Escherichia coli (n = 72), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 20), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 8), Proteus mirabilis (n = 4), group B streptococcus (n = 12), and enterococcus (n = 8) were isolated. Time for detection of positive urine samples was similar in both types of tubes. Delayed cultures had significant numbers of false-positive results. Antimicrobial susceptibility results did not appear to be influenced greatly by Becton-Dickinson tube transport. The MS-2 cannot adequately discriminate cultures containing less than 50,000 colony-forming units/ml of urine. The Becton-Dickinson tube appears to be compatible for use with the MS-2 for purposes of screening for bacteriuria.
TI  - Microbiological aspects of the 1980 national prevalence survey of infections in hospitals.
AB  - The records of the 1980 national prevalence survey of infection in hospitals were re-assessed from a microbiological point of view. Of 407 records of Escherichia coli, 71 per cent came from the urinary tract while the commonest source of Staphylococcus aureus was from skin infections. These yielded only 41 per cent of the 303 records. Proteus spp. were recorded 166 times, Pseudomonas spp. 115 times and Klebsiella spp. 101 times. These came mainly from the urinary tract but other sources were important. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the viruses were associated with community infections while E. coli, Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., Str. faecalis and non-aureus staphylococci were associated with hospital-acquired infections. The prevalence of bacteraemia was re-assessed.
TI  - Current mechanisms of resistance to antimicrobial agents in microorganisms causing infection in the patient at risk for infection.
AB  - The mechanisms of resistance encountered in bacteria causing infection in the patient at risk for infection are diverse. Most resistance currently seen is the result of plasmid transfer rather than mutational events. However, extensive use of antimicrobial agents in the hospital has caused the selection of organisms resistant to many agents by virtue of chromosomally mediated mechanisms. Staphylococcus aureus resistant to beta-lactams due to altered penicillin-binding proteins has become a problem in certain patients such as narcotic addicts and chronic care facility patients exposed to many beta-lactam antibiotics. S. epidermidis has also proved to be a problem in patients with indwelling foreign devices, and altered penicillin-binding proteins also make these organisms resistant to available penicillins and cephalosporins. Streptococcus fecalis has become increasingly resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, and tetracyclines due to plasmid-mediated enzymes. Hemophilus influenzae resistant to both penicillins and chloramphenicol by virtue of beta-lactamases and chloramphenicol transacetylase has been encountered. Beta-lactamase-mediated resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae to beta-lactam antibiotics has increased, and resistance of Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to aminoglycosides and penicillins is a widespread phenomenon. Mechanisms to reduce resistance will include not only careful attention to hygienic practices but also more appropriate use of antibiotics selecting the proper agent depending on the type of patient and environment in which the infection develops.
TI  - In vitro activity of fludalanine combined with pentizidone compared with those of other agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of fludalanine ( MK641 ) combined with pentizidone ( MK642  ) so as to give a fludalanine /D-cycloserine ratio of 1:1 was compared with the activities of ampicillin, ticarcillin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, and trimethoprim against 452 recent isolates and known beta-lactam- and trimethoprim-resistant strains. In addition, the in vitro activity of fludalanine - pentizidone on four different media, including a defined medium ( DFN -2), was studied. The MIC of fludalanine - pentizidone against 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Providencia stuartii, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Staphylococcus aureus, and fecal streptococci was 4 micrograms or less per ml on DFN -2, and activity was somewhat reduced on the other media. Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% MIC, less than or equal to 64 micrograms/ml) and Bacteroides spp. (90% MIC, 16 micrograms/ml) were less susceptible. Generally, fludalanine - pentizidone was less active than ceftazidime and comparable in activity to cefuroxime. beta-Lactamase-producing and trimethoprim-resistant strains tended to be susceptible to fludalanine - pentidizone . In the absence of human serum, the MBC of fludalanine - pentizidone was similar to the MIC. In the presence of increasing concentrations of human serum, there tended to be a greater difference between the MIC and MBC.
TI  - [Clinical laboratory approach for estimating effective administrative dosage of cefmenoxime. Observation on the MICS and cefmenoxime disc susceptibility test].
AB  - The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (CMX) was determined using agar dilution at  inoculum level of 10(6) cfu/ml against 333 clinical bacterial isolates. CMX was highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter aerogenes and Haemophilus influenzae and also Streptococcus Pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC values in the range of 0.024 to 3.13 micrograms/ml. Against Staphylococci and Serratia marcescens, CMX showed the antimicrobial activity with MIC90 6.25 micrograms/ml. However, CMX was not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter anitratus and exhibited no useful activity against Streptococcus faecalis. Reliability of CMX disc diffusion susceptibility test for quantitative estimation of the antimicrobial activity was also investigated, using 8 mm diameter disc (Showa) and 6 mm diameter disc (Wako), both of them containing 30 micrograms of CMX. These disc susceptibility test results were well correlated with MICs, capable of utilizing CMX disc susceptibility test for the estimation of proper administrative dose of CMX. Using 6 mm diameter disc containing 30 micrograms CMX, FUCHS et al. have proposed the following tentative zone size break points: greater than or equal to 22 mm = MIC 8 micrograms/ml, susceptible; 15 to 21 mm = MIC 16 approximately 32 micrograms/ml, moderately susceptible (intermediate); and less than or equal to 14 mm = MIC greater than 32 micrograms/ml, resistant. In this investigation, the following zone size break points have preferred: greater than or equal to 25 mm = MIC less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml (3+); 20 to 24 mm = MIC greater than 3 to 15 micrograms/ml (2+); 16 to 19 mm = MIC greater than 15 to 60 micrograms/ml (+) and less than or equal to 15 mm = MIC greater than or equal to 60 micrograms/ml (-). Based on CMX pharmacokinetic data currently available, MIC break points proposed, less than or equal to 3 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 15 micrograms/ml, would be useful for estimating the administrative dose of this antibiotic to obtain the effective blood level (e.g. the bacteriostatic activity in serum 1: greater than or equal to 8 for treatment of severe infection.
TI  - Volatile products from acetylcholine as markers in the rapid urine test using head-space gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Head-space gas--liquid chromatographic analyses of cultures of all Proteus spp. showed that the production of trimethylamine from acetylcholine could be the marker for the detection in 3.5 h of significant numbers of P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri and P. inconstans A in the rapid test for Escherichia and Klebsiella spp. in urine specimens. Trimethylamine was not detected in cultures of five other urinary pathogens. Six of fifteen strains of K. aerogenes produced trimethylamine from acetylcholine but were distinguished from Proteus spp. by ethanol production from arabinose. Ethyl acetate was produced from acetylcholine by P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, P. rettgeri, P. inconstans A, P. inconstans B, E. coli, K. aerogenes and Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Significance of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups in mixed infections.
AB  - Organisms of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides fragilis groups are  often found mixed with facultatively anaerobic organisms in infections. The relative importance of these Bacteroides groups and facultative anaerobic pathogens in mixed infections was investigated in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. This was determined by observing the effect of antimicrobial therapy directed against one or both organisms present in the abscess. Clindamycin or metronidazole was used for treatment of infections caused by Bacteroides species, and either gentamicin, penicillin, ampicillin, or oxacillin was used for treatment of infections caused by facultative flora. In almost all instances the aerobic counterparts in the infection were more important than the unencapsulated Bacteroides species. On the other hand, encapsulated B. melaninogenicus group organisms were found to be more important in abscess formation than were group A streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Encapsulated B. fragilis group organisms were found to be more important than or as important as Escherichia coli and group D streptococci and less important than S. aureus, group A streptococci, and K. pneumoniae in induction of subcutaneous abscesses. This study demonstrates that encapsulated Bacteroides species are a factor that should be considered in the treatment of mixed infections with antibiotics.
TI  - In vitro and clinical evaluation of ceforanide.
AB  - Ceforanide, a new cephalosporin antibiotic with a long half-life (three hours), was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity, pharmacology, and clinical efficacy. Fifty-two patients with 56 infections due to susceptible organisms received ceforanide, 0.5 g, 1 g, or 2 g, intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours for four to 60 days (average: 14.1 days). The in vitro studies of our clinical isolates showed that 12.0 micrograms/ml or less of ceforanide inhibited all Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta hemolytic streptococci group A, B, F, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Hemophilus influenzae. After a 1 gram intramuscular dose, the mean peak serum concentration at one hour was 44.0 micrograms/ml, and at 12 hours was 3.8 micrograms/ml. After a 1 gram intravenous dose, the mean peak serum concentration was 65.0 micrograms/ml, and the mean trough serum concentration at 12 hours was 9.6 micrograms/ml. The infections treated included ten pneumonias, ten urinary tract infections, seven bacteremias, two osteomyelitis, and 35 skin-soft tissue infections. Of the 56 evaluable infections treated, 52 had a clinical cure with only four failures. Ceforanide was well tolerated, with no patients developing thrombophlebitis, or liver or renal abnormalities. Three patients developed abnormal Coombs' reactions and one had diarrhea.
TI  - In-vitro activity of enoxacin (CL-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of enoxacin (CI-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. In addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. The MICs of enoxacin for 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for Haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and Neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. Bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, MIC90 16 mg/l. Against many of the common Enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar degree of activity as gentamicin. Gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. The protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.
TI  - Cerebrospinal fluid glucose and leukocyte responses in experimental meningitis.
AB  - The fall in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose and CSF leukocyte response was studied in cats with experimental meningitis. Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, and the latter organisms were incubated with CSF in vitro. When 10(6)-10(9)K. pneumoniae were incubated with 4 ml of CSF, the time time necessary for the glucose to decrease to less than 10 mg/dl ranged from 6.5 to 2.5 h, at a rate proportional to the size of the inoculum. When the same numbers of bacteria were injected intracisternally, the time ranged from 9 to 3 h, and the CSF leukocyte response did not exceed 1200 WBC/mm3. At this time, only minimal histological changes in brain and choroid plexus were seen. Twenty hours after intrathecal K. pneumoniae, large numbers of leukocytes (up to 4 X 10(4)/mm3) were recovered from the CSF. Regardless of the number of leukocytes, however, hypoglycorrhachia occurred when the CSF contained more than 10(7) bacteria/ml. At this interval, large numbers of leukocytes were seen invading the stroma of the choroid plexus, leptomeninges and perivascular spaces. When 10(8) S. pneumoniae were injected intracisternally, CSF glucose concentration decreased as rapidly as with K. pneumoniae. The spinal fluid leukocyte response to S. pneumoniae was, however, greater than that to K. pneumoniae. These results suggest that under the conditions of these studies, hypoglycorrhachia of bacterial meningitis is the result of metabolism of the bacteria with little contribution from the leukocytes.
TI  - Inhibition of mastitic bacteria by bovine milk apo-lactoferrin evaluated by in vitro microassay of bacterial growth.
AB  - An in vitro microassay was developed to evaluate antimicrobial properties of bovine apo-lactoferrin. The growth of coliform, staphylococcal, and streptococcal bacterial strains in a defined synthetic medium was inhibited by bovine apo-lactoferrin (.5 to 30.0 mg/ml). Addition of iron-saturated lactoferrin to the synthetic medium did not inhibit growth of test strains. Inhibition by apo-lactoferrin was greater for coliform than Gram-positive strains for all concentrations of apo-lactoferrin evaluated. No concentration of apo-lactoferrin proved bactericidal for either coliform or Gram-positive strains. Inhibition of two coliform strains by apo-lactoferrin (10 mg/ml) was abolished by addition of ferric iron to the assay system, indicating an iron-dependent nature of apo-lactoferrin induced inhibition of bacteria. Bicarbonate supplementation of the growth system containing apo-lactoferrin (1 mg/ml) increased inhibition of three coliform strains by apo-lactoferrin. Addition of increasing concentrations of citrate (2.0 mg/ml) to an assay system containing apo-lactoferrin (5 mg/ml) resulted in a concomitant reduction of growth inhibition of three coliform strains. These data indicate a potential relationship between the molar ratio of citrate to lactoferrin of the lacteal secretion and its capacity to inhibit coliform strains associated with mastitis.
TI  - Chemiluminescent response to pathogenic organisms: normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  - Chemiluminescence (CL) is a sensitive indicator of phagocytosis and intracellular killing; however, little is known of the normal CL response by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes to different pathogenic microorganisms. We investigated the luminol-enhanced CL response of normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes to a number of common bacterial pathogens and two yeasts. We analyzed the CL response to viable and heat-killed microorganisms at 25 and 37 degrees C. The CL response to all microorganisms was greater and more rapid at 37 degrees C. Variable responses were observed with viable and heat-killed microorganisms; some were unaffected, whereas other demonstrated reduced CL. Each microorganism caused a reproducible response pattern, which could be placed into two general categories. In the first category were those which caused a rapid exponential rise and decay in CL: Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and zymosan. In the second category were those which rose slowly over a longer time course to a poorly defined peak: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The CL response also reflected serum opsonic activity. The effect of inactivated complement, factor B, and removal of specific antibody were investigated. Increasing the concentration of zymosan gave a proportional rise in peak CL; however, a strain of E. coli caused a variation in peak time rather than peak height. Different CL kinetics were shown for three strains of K. pneumoniae, possibly a result of each having different membrane or cell wall characteristics. This study defines the nature and factors affecting the normal CL response to a variety of common pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Clinicopathologic study of six cases of meningitis and meningoencephalitis in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes).
AB  - Three fatal cases of purulent meningitis and one fatal case of thromboembolic necrotizing meningoencephalitis occurred in chimpanzees from the Primate Center TNO, The Netherlands. In addition, two apes had clinical signs of meningitis and were successfully treated. The severity of the residual hemiparesis and dysphagia in one of these two apes was such that it was killed for humane reasons. The histopathological diagnosis was chronic active meningoencephalitis. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from five apes and Klebsiella pneumoniae from one. In the majority of cases, the primary site of infection was the upper respiratory tract. After reducing the population density, initiating a vaccination program using a commercially available human polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine, and changing the cleaning procedure of the animal facilities, no other cases of meningitis or meningoencephalitis have occurred in the chimpanzee colony in the ensuing 3.5 years.
TI  - Five cephalosporins: pharmacokinetics and their relation to antibacterial potency.
AB  - In a group of adult volunteers, pharmacokinetic profiles of five cephalosporins were correlated with their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs90) against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes. Subjects received the following intravenous regimens in a randomized, crossover fashion: (1) 0.5 gm, 1 gm, or 2 gm of cefazolin; (2) 2 gm of cephalothin; (3) 1 gm of cephapirin; (4) 1 gm of cefoxitin; or (5) 0.5 gm of cefamandole. The 500-mg dose of cefazolin produced serum concentrations that exceeded those of any of the other cephalosporins at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after administration. The area under the curve for this dose of cefazolin was at least twice that of any of the other antibiotics. Two hours after a 500-mg dose of cefazolin, serum levels exceeded the MIC90 for all seven groups of pathogens; at six hours, the 500-mg dose of cefazolin continued to achieve serum levels above the MIC90 against the majority of bacterial groups. In contrast, at two hours after administration none of the other cephalosporins maintained serum levels above the MIC90 for all pathogens; at six hours, the levels of cephapirin were adequate to inhibit the two streptococci, but serum levels of all other cephalosporins were inadequate to inhibit any of the pathogens. These data indicate that a 500-mg dose of cefazolin maintains serum levels above the MICs90 longer than any of the other cephalosporins tested and support the use of a 500-mg dose of cefazolin every eight hours for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of most community-acquired infections. Such a comparatively low dosage offers substantial savings to both patient and hospital.
TI  - Compensation of cyclophosphamide immunosuppression by a bacterial immunostimulant (Broncho-Vaxom) in mice.
AB  - The compensatory effect of a bacterial lysate, Broncho-Vaxom (BV) on the immunosuppressive action of cyclophosphamide (CY) was investigated. In CY immunosuppressed mice, BV treated animals recovered to normal levels of IgM and IgG in serum as well of IgA and IgG in gut secretions significantly earlier than controls. Furthermore, normal cell proliferation in thymus, as estimated by measuring the relative size of this organ was achieved earlier in BV treated mice than in control mice. Oral treatment with BV restores the number of IgM anti SRBC producing cells in spleen, in CY immunosuppressed mice. Since immunosuppression induced by CY increases the susceptibility to various infections, we tested in immunosuppressed animals the protective effect of BV towards IP challenge infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae var ozaenae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. BV led to an enhanced resistance towards both pneumococci and staphylococci challenge infections but not to the other challenge microorganisms.
TI  - Asian multicenter trial of cefoperazone in respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The safety and clinical efficacy of cefoperazone were evaluated in a multicenter  trial conducted at institutions in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Cefoperazone was given as the sole antibiotic for 481 respiratory tract infections in 476 patients. An overall satisfactory clinical response was achieved in 73.7% of patients. Cefoperazone was effective in 78.9% of cases of pneumonia, 81.1% of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, and 69.4% of bronchiectasis with infection. A satisfactory bacteriological effect was obtained in 93.2% of cases in which Haemophilus influenzae was isolated, 70.2% of Klebsiella infections, and 84.6% of infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although the eradication rate was only 38.6% in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the success rate increases to 59.1% if patients showing a decrease in the number of organisms are included. Cefoperazone was effective in 63.5% of the 148 cases that had failed to respond to treatment with other antibiotics. Adverse reactions occurred in 8.0% of patients and consisted primarily of rash, diarrhea, and fever. Cefoperazone appears to be an extremely useful injectable antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Activity of imipenem on aerobic bacteria.
AB  - Imipenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with a broad spectrum of activity on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is a potent inhibitor of plasmid- and chromosomally-mediated beta-lactamases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of imipenem on clinical isolates classified according to their susceptibility to beta-lactam antibiotics. On penicillin G-susceptible bacteria, imipenem is comparable to penicillin. On streptococci, pneumococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria the MICs were 0.02 to 0.06 mg/l. On gonococci, MICs were 0.04 to 0.25 mg/l. Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics or naturally resistant to certain of them (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin) were highly susceptible to imipenem with MICs from 0.06 to 0.5 mg/l. It was slightly less active on Haemophilus influenzae, compared to ampicillin. On beta-lactam-resistant bacteria, imipenem maintained a remarkable activity. For penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC 16 mg/l) the imipenem MIC was 1 mg/l. Imipenem was equally effective on beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing Haemophilus influenzae and gonococci. Among 12 Nocardia asteroides tested, 11 had MIC less than 1 mg/l. When tested at 30 degrees, the MIC of imipenem for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 8 to 64 mg/l in contrast to 0.03 to 0.06 mg/l for oxacillin-sensitive isolates. Eighteen strains of enterococci (17 faecium, 2 faecalis) resistant to ampicillin (MIC 128 mg/l) were more resistant to imipenem (MIC 16 to 256 mg/l). Imipenem was very active on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including multiply-resistant Salmonella typhi., with MICs in a range from 0.06 to 4 mg/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Bacterial colonization of the nose and external ear canal in newborn infants.
AB  - The bacterial flora of the nose and external ear canal of 132 newborn infants, aged 3 days and 4 to 7 days, was examined. Cultures taken from the nose showed the following pattern of bacterial colonization: normal flora (39%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (23%); gram-negative enteric rods (16%); and sterile cultures (22%). The most frequent bacterial cultures from nostrils were Staphylococcus epidermidis (39%); Staph. aureus (11%) and Escherichia coli (8%). The cultures from the external ear canal showed normal flora (37%); potentially pathologic gram-positive microorganisms (5%); gram-negative enteric rods (24%); and sterile cultures (34%). The most frequent bacteria cultured from the ear canal were: Staph. epidermidis (37%); E. coli (8%); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%). Of several factors studied, the type of delivery, Apgar score and the duration of hospitalization were found to have a significant influence on the pattern of bacterial colonization.
TI  - Bacteremia in hospitalized children.
AB  - Among 7,205 children hospitalized in the Pediatric Service at the Rokach (Hadassah) Hospital during 1980 and 1981, 44 were found to be bacteremic. The most common pathogen was Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and others; 52% of the isolates were gram-negative. The most common focus of infection was the respiratory tract, followed by the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. Almost half of the bacteremic children were under 2 years of age. Other data, such as predisposing conditions and mortality, and whether the bacteremias were hospital acquired, are also analyzed. All of the findings are discussed and compared to the findings from the few similar studies in the literature.
TI  - [Susceptibility of bacteria isolated from lower respiratory tract infections to antibiotics (1981)].
AB  - During the period from September 1981 to March 1982, 363 bacterial isolates were  obtained as possible pathogens from 311 patients with lower respiratory tract infections at 12 medical institutions in Japan. Of these clinical isolates, mostly from the sputum, a total of 231 isolates including 19 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, 33 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 90 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 65 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 17 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 7 strains of Escherichia coli were tested in vitro for minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 17 antimicrobial agents, and their antimicrobial susceptibility distribution and cumulative percentages of inhibited isolates by increasing concentrations of drugs were determined. The data were further analyzed to investigate the interrelation between such parameters as the age-distribution of patients by diseases of the respiratory system, sex and types of infection and the species and frequency of isolation of the organisms, and also the relationship between the antimicrobial chemotherapy prior to collection of clinical specimens and the species and incidence of the bacterial isolates. In respiratory infections, it is frequently that chemotherapy should be instituted with an appropriate drug even before the causative organism can be identified and assessed for its antimicrobial susceptibility. The present data may provide valuable informations in selecting appropriate drugs in practical, clinical use.
TI  - A microbiological evaluation of apalcillin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of apalcillin was tested against 350 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis. Using a minimal inhibitory concentration of 16 mg/l as the breakpoint, only 19.7% of the strains were resistant to apalcillin. A regression analysis demonstrated that it is possible to test bacteria for sensitivity with a 20 micrograms apalcillin disc. The results on Mueller-Hinton agar are very similar to those on Iso-Sensitest medium. Like other ureido penicillins, apalcillin is sensitive to most beta-lactamases; it is effective against ampicillin-resistant strains since it penetrates the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria well and is highly effective against target proteins. Strains producing high amounts of beta-lactamases do become resistant to apalcillin.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - In vitro susceptibilities of canine urinary bacteria to selected antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were conducted on bacteria that were isolated  from urine specimens collected by antepubic cystocentesis from dogs with urinary tract infections. Antimicrobics to which greater than or equal to 90% of these urinary bacteria were susceptible in vitro included trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Escherichia coli; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Proteus mirabilis; ampicillin chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of coagulase-positive staphylococci; cephalexin, nalidixic acid, and gentamicin for isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae; ampicillin, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Streptococcus faecalis, Str faecium, and Str zymogenes; ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, and gentamicin for isolates of Str viridans; and ampicillin, chloramphenicol, TMP-SMZ, nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, kanamycin, and gentamicin for isolates of Str canis. No antimicrobial agent tested was effective in vitro at the 90% level for isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but gentamicin was closest, at 89%.
TI  - The effects of intratracheally administered coarse mode particles on respiratory  tract infection in mice.
AB  - Because coarse mode particles are rarely studied in their existing size ranges (greatest mass about 5-7 microns, aerodynamic diameter), we investigated the effects of four such particles, quartz, ferric oxide, calcium carbonate, and sodium feldspar, on host defenses against bacterial pulmonary infection. Mice which received intratracheal instillations of 10, 33, and 100 micrograms/mouse were exposed within an hour to aerosols of viable Streptococcus, and pneumonia-induced mortality was measured. At 33 and 100 micrograms/mouse, all particles significantly increased mortality. At the lower dose, only Fe2O3 caused a significant increase in mortality. To evaluate potential delayed effects, mice were challenged with the bacteria 24 h after exposure to 100 micrograms particles/mouse. Delaying the challenge did not significantly alter the response, except for the sodium feldspar group for which a partial recovery was observed. When mice exposed to 100 micrograms particles/mouse received aerosols of Klebsiella pneumoniae 24 h later, there was no significant effect on pulmonary bactericidal activity. For the model system used, it appears that Fe2O3, CaCO3, and sodium feldspar have effects roughly equivalent to quartz.
TI  - Cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  - The enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by Dr. Pierce in 1905. The purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. A solution of 1 L of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 U heparin, and 5 mEq KCl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to Peptococcus anaerobius and Clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis. In a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36 L over 2 days. No lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. In a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, natural peptide antibiotics of rabbit lung macrophages.
AB  - Microbicidal cationic proteins 1 and 2, peptides derived from rabbit lung macrophages, were tested for bactericidal activity against various bacterial species. Both were highly active against diverse gram-positive and gram-negative organisms under conditions of near-neutral pH (between 7 and 8) and relatively low ionic strength. Susceptible species included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, and Serratia marcescens. Streptococcus agalactiae, type 1A, was less susceptible than the aforementioned organisms or S. agalactiae, type 3. Bordetella bronchiseptica, a common commensal and pathogen of the rabbit respiratory tract, was completely resistant to both peptides.
TI  - [Sensitivity of the recent bacterial isolates to cefotaxime and other cephem antibiotics].
AB  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 703 nonselected strains of 14 different bacterial species to cefazolin, cefmetazole, cefotiam, cefoperazone latamoxef, and cefotaxime (CTX) was examined. CTX was the most active against E. coli, Klebsiella, Serratia, P. mirabilis, H. influenzae, beta-Streptococcus group A, beta-Streptococcus group B and S. pneumoniae. On the other hand, CTX-resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml) strains were isolated at the following frequencies: Citrobacter, 21.7%; Enterobacter, 7.7%; Serratia, 4.6%; P. aeruginosa, 40.4% and B. fragilis, 28.6%. Of the 411 strains classified as very sensitive () or moderately sensitive (++) by disk method, 405 strains (98.5%) were inhibited by less than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml of CTX. Only 1 strain (0.2%) was falsely classified as moderately sensitive and no strains were falsely categorized as resistant.
TI  - [Orotracheobronchial aspiration for bacteriologic and cytologic diagnosis].
AB  - A presently described new method for obtaining tracheal and bronchial secretions  does not only represent an alternative to established methods, but also enlarges, due to its simple bedside performance, the indication for an invasive procedure, e. g. in pneumonias. Despite a transoral approach to trachea and bronchi bacterial contamination was excluded. Bacteriologic and cytologic results of orotracheobronchial aspiration in 25 patients with bronchopulmonary infections and one patient with eosinophilic pneumonia represented a valuable help for the correct diagnosis and thus for treatment.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of E-0702, a new cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of E-0702 was compared with the in vitro activity of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam against 600 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic isolates. E-0702 had a minimal inhibitory concentration for 50% of isolates (MIC50) of 25 micrograms for Staphylococcus aureus, 50 micrograms for Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 1.6 to 3.1 micrograms for streptococci, with Streptococcus faecalis resistant. E-0702 had MIC50s against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes comparable to those of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, moxalactam, and aztreonam, but MIC90S were higher than those of the other agents. It was as active as the other agents against Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp., but was four- to eightfold less active against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Providencia spp., Morganella spp., and Proteus vulgaris, with isolates in each species resistant. Activity against Bacteroides fragilis was fourfold less than that of cefoxitin. E-0702 was hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases and was only a weak inhibitor of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. There was an inoculum effect for E. cloacae, Serratia spp., Morganella spp., and Pseudomonas spp.
TI  - Rapid diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens in patients with bacterial pneumonia is important for optimal antimicrobial therapy. Coagglutination was compared with counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) for sensitivity and specificity in the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa antigens in sputum specimens of 101 patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Coagglutination detected the appropriate bacterial antigen in 16 of 17 (94%) definite etiology patients and CIE detected 11 (64%). In 17 probable etiology patients, bacterial antigens were detected by coagglutination in 15 (88%) and by CIE in 7 (41%). Only 1 pathogen was falsely identified in the 19 culture-negative control patients, indicating a high degree of specificity for both tests. Coagglutination was more sensitive than CIE (p less than 0.05) or sputum stained with Gram's stain (p less than 0.05) in correctly identifying the putative pathogen in sputum. Our results strongly suggest that coagglutination is a useful diagnostic technique for establishing a rapid etiologic diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia.
TI  - Third-generation and investigational cephalosporins: II. Microbiologic review and clinical summaries.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Hemophilus influenzae, Bacteroides fragilis, and Neisseria gonorrhea to three new second-generation and eight third-generation cephalosporins is tabulated. In general, the newer cephalosporins have an extended spectrum of activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria gonorrhea. They also tend to be active against anaerobes, including Bacteroides fragilis. However, they generally have less activity against gram-positive bacteria when compared with the first- and second-generation cephalosporins. Clinical summaries are given for each of the cephalosporins, with emphasis on the results of comparative clinical trials. These cephalosporins may prove especially useful in nosocomial infections with resistant organisms, intraabdominal infections, febrile episodes in the granulocytopenic patient, and meningitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates in pediatrics to cefpiramide].
AB  - Cefpiramide (CPM, SM-1652) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against most of clinically isolated organisms to which are paid attention as pathogenic organism in the field of pediatrics. Antibacterial activities of CPM against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Bordetella pertussis and Proteus mirabilis were almost the same as those of cefoperazone (CPZ). Antibacterial activities of CPM against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were somewhat weaker than those of CPZ, but antibacterial activity of CPM against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was rather stronger than that of CPZ and almost the same as that of cefsulodin. Antibacterial activity of CPM has a tendency to decrease in beta-lactamase (PCase type) producing S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, H. Influenzae, etc. It is suggestive that the determination of not only the antibacterial activity of CPM against pathogenic organisms but also the beta-lactamase producing activity of them is important on the occasion of clinical use of CPM.
TI  - [Evaluation of in vitro antibacterial potencies of oral antibiotics against sputum isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility of 162 sputum isolates to oral antibiotics was measured by an agar dilution method. The sputum isolates included S. pneumoniae 25 strains, S. aureus 30 strains, H. influenzae 37 strains, K. pneumoniae 51 strains and E. coli 19 strains. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of cefaclor (CCL), cephalexin (CEX), ampicillin (ABPC) and minocycline (MINO) were measured for each strains. Eighty percent of S. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.024 to 0.05 micrograms/ml of ABPC, 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of CCL, and 1.56 to 3.13 micrograms/ml of CEX and MINO. ABPC, CCL and CEX were considered to be effective clinically when they were used with the usual dosage. However, about 30% of strains were resistant to the usual dosage of orally administrated MINO. Eighty percent of S. aureus strains were inhibited at 0.20 to 0.39 microgram/ml of MINO and 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of the other 3 drugs. MINO is the most effective with the usual dosage. Twenty to 40% of strains showed resistance to CCL, CEX and ABPC. Eighty percent of H. influenzae strains were inhibited at 0.39 micrograms/ml of ABPC, 0.78 to 1.56 micrograms/ml of MINO, 3.13 micrograms/ml of CCL and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of CEX. ABPC should be selected as the first choice antibiotic. However, there were 2 ABPC-resistant strains that were highly susceptible to CCL. Eighty percent of K. pneumoniae strains were inhibited at 0.39 to 0.78 micrograms/ml of CCL, 3.13 to 6.25 micrograms/ml of MINO and CEX, and 12.5 to 25 micrograms/ml of ABPC. CCL seemed to be only effective oral antibiotic for K. pneumoniae infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Nosocomial urinary tract infections: secular trends, treatment and economics in a university hospital.
AB  - During a 71-month interval 3,024 nosocomial urinary tract infections were identified by prospective surveillance at our hospital. The annual attack rate varied between 2.0 and 3.1 per 100 admissions. Gram-negative bacilli caused 74 per cent of all urinary infections and recurrent infections in the hospital accounted for only 1 per cent. The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli (24 per cent), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 per cent), Streptococcus faecalis (7 per cent), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6 per cent) and Proteus mirabilis (6 per cent). Candida species caused 10 per cent of the infections and may represent a hospital-acquired pathogen of increasing importance. The burn unit had a significantly higher proportion of Enterobacter infections (21 per cent) than any other service (p less than 0.05). The plastic surgery service had more Serratia infections (24 per cent), whereas obstetrics and gynecology had more Escherichia coli infections (47 per cent) relative to other hospital services. More than 99 per cent of the patients with nosocomial urinary tract infections received antimicrobial drugs; in 63 per cent the chart documented that drug therapy was prescribed specifically for treatment of the urinary infections. Hospital-acquired urinary infections added approximately 1 million dollars to hospital expenses during the study interval. Estimates were made of the economic benefits of successful control programs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle.
AB  - The BACTEC resin-containing blood culture bottle (16B; Johnston Laboratories) was designed to bind antibiotics and to support bacterial growth. However, only modest increases in the recovery rates of pathogens have been found in clinical studies. This in vitro study evaluated the ability of the 16B to recover organisms from human serum containing clinically achievable concentrations of antibiotics. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and a viridans streptococcus were added to serum containing antibiotic(s), and at various time intervals of antibiotic exposure, portions were removed and inoculated into both the 16B and the 6B (conventional aerobic) bottles. The studies of the kinetics of killing of the bacterial strains by the various antibiotics showed a good correlation between those combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which produced slow killing and the combinations of bacteria-antibiotic(s) which were recovered preferentially in the 16B bottles. Low recovery rates were noted when the antibiotics killed the organisms rapidly. The indications for use of the resin-containing blood culture bottle should be limited to those situations in which the patient is receiving antibiotics and the bacteremia is suspected to involve a pathogen which is killed slowly by the administered drug(s) or when the bacteremia is continuous. The failure of the BACTEC 16B blood culture bottle to recover organisms may in part reflect the bactericidal activity of the antibiotics administered.
TI  - Pneumatocele in infants and children. Report of 12 cases.
AB  - Pneumatoceles were found in 2.4 per cent of 493 infants and children with pneumonia. In all cases, attempts were made to establish the etiology by means of blood cultures and of deep tracheal aspirations or pleural punctures, when indicated. A definite cause was established in 9 of 12 cases. Seven were due to infection: in two Hemophilus influenzae was involved; two others were due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were each isolated in one case. Two pneumatoceles were seen following kerosene ingestion. A coagulase negative staphylococcus isolated only on blood culture in one other child may have been related to the illness. Two patients experienced spontaneous pneumothorax and died of progressive respiratory failure due to enlargement of the pneumatocele, but all the other patients recovered without complication. Pneumatoceles in childhood can result from a variety of bacterologic infections as well as from kerosene ingestion.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial pneumonia requiring admission to hospital.
AB  - Patients who develop bacterial pneumonia in the community often require admission to acute-care hospitals. Knowledge of the incidence of pneumonia due to different pathogens that are brought into an institution from the community may play a role in determining the patterns of infecting organisms responsible for hospital-acquired pneumonia. For 1 year, we prospectively reviewed the records of patients admitted to our 1000-bed community hospital with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Patients had clinical signs and symptoms, positive radiologic findings, and pure cultures of potential pathogens from sputum, blood, pleural fluid, lung aspirate, lung biopsy, or transtracheal aspirate. Pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila was diagnosed by serum indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titer greater than or equal to 1:256 and clinical signs and symptoms along with response to erythromycin. Of 204 patients with bacterial pneumonia, the following pathogens were implicated: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus species, L. pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, oral anaerobic bacteria, Psuedomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and others. Most patients were more than 50 years of age and many had evidence of underlying pulmonary disease. The etiology of CABP may not be as predictable as in the past. Empiric antimicrobial therapy for CABP should include agents with activity against the pathogens prevalent in the community.
TI  - Susceptibility testing of biliary bacteria obtained before bile duct manipulation.
AB  - Over a 3 3/4-year period, bile culture and susceptibility studies were performed  on 41 patients before any instrumentation or manipulation of the biliary tract for retained biliary stone extraction. At least one bile bacterium was identified in 90% of the patients examined. As many as seven organisms were identified in one patient. Of the organisms, 62% were Gram-negative aerobes, the most representative being Klebsiella pneumonia; 27% were Gram-positive aerobes, the Enterococcus grouping being the most representative. Nine percent of the isolates were anaerobic bacteria and 2% yeast. Fifteen percent of the patients developed signs of sepsis. Three of these patients had manipulation of their bile ducts with a choledochoscope and grew out positive blood cultures; all were treated successfully and recovered uneventfully. Susceptibility testing on all aerobic bacteria was performed, indicating 97% effective coverage of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using synergistic antibiotics of ampicillin and an aminoglycoside. Even with 9% of the isolated bacteria being anaerobes, the effective coverage using the same two drug combinations was about 88%. Because of the relatively high percentage (15%) of patients developing signs and symptoms of sepsis, synergistic prophylactic antimicrobial therapy is recommended in patients who are debilitated, in instrumentation of obstructed bile ducts, or with choledoschoscopy.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of jejunostomy fluid after surgery for extrahepatic biliary atresia.
AB  - Quantitative cultures were made of jejunostomy fluid from 22 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia following hepatoportoenterostomy. Bacterial flora characteristics did not differ in patients with or without cholangitis. With the exception of Streptococcus group D, the most frequently encountered bacterial species with the highest mean concentrations in the jejunostomy fluid, were those mostly responsible for cholangitis (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In 19 of 22 acute episodes, the organism causing cholangitis identified in blood and/or liver was also isolated from jejunostomy fluid. However, quantitative determinations in this fluid did not permit reliable identification of this organism. When the same bacterium caused early relapse, it often persisted in the jejunostomy fluid.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin in vitro.
AB  - Fosfomycin is a new bactericidal broad-spectrum antibiotic. In this study the minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) was determined for 745 recent clinical isolates. Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, group A and B streptococci Streptococcus faecalis and pneumoniae as well as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens and Haemophilus influenzae were very sensitive to the new drug with essentially all strains inhibited at 64 mg/l or less. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, indole-positive proteus and Pseudomonas-aeruginosa were less sensitive with 96, 42, 66 and 58% inhibited at 64 mg/l of fosfomycin. Bacteroides fragilis was resistant.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - New broad-spectrum cephalosporins with anti-pseudomonal activity. III. Synthesis  and antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-(methyl or substituted methyl)-ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids.
AB  - The influence of various 3-substituents on the antibacterial activity of 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acids (III) was investigated. Introduction of an acidic substituent, such as a sulfo or a carboxyl group, to a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent (IIIf--i) resulted in a marked loss of activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes, in contrast to an in crease of activity against Proteus mirabilis. Displacement of the acetoxy group of IIIb with pyridines (IIIm--p) enhanced the activity against P. aeruginosa and E. aerogenes: their activity against those strains were superior to that of the cephalosporin IIId having a 3-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazolyl)thiomethyl substituent. As a result of extensive studies in addition to the study of in vitro activity in this series, 7 beta-[D-2-(4-hydroxy-6-methylpyridine-3-carbonylamino)-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, code No. SM-1652, cefpiramide (generic name), was selected as a candidate for further biological and clinical investigations.
TI  - Hydrogen peroxide-mediated antagonism against serratia marcescens by Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - The alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus mitis strain no. 17-1, isolated from the oral cavity of an healthy female adult, antagonized the growth of all 24 test strains of Serratia marcescens examined; furthermore, this strain inhibited the growth of various strains of Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. However, strans of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved refractory. The mechanism of microbial antagonism was due to production and release of hydrogen peroxide under aerobic atmospheric conditions, which was neutralized through incorporation of bovine liver catalase into the solid assay medium.
TI  - Intramammary infections in primigravid heifers near parturition.
AB  - Mammary secretion from 32 primigravid heifers was obtained aseptically to determine frequency of bacterial isolation and incidence of intramammary infection near parturition. Quarter samples were collected 14 and 7 days prior to expected parturition, at parturition, and 7 and 14 days postparturition. Analysis of culture data indicated that 77.1% of samples were bacteriologically negative, and 15.7% contained coagulase negative staphylococci, 4.4% streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 3.8% coliforms, .8% coagulase positive staphylococci, and .1% Corynebacterium bovis. Frequency of bacterial isolation was highest in samples obtained prior to and at parturition. Thirty-five of 128 quarters were infected at parturition. Twenty-six of the 35 infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylococci, 4 by streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, 4 by coliforms, and 1 by coagulase positive staphylococci. Twenty infections were observed during the early postpartum period. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections decreased markedly. However, the number and type of primary pathogen infections during early lactation were similar to those at parturition.
TI  - Susceptibility of bovine mammary gland to infections during the dry period.
AB  - Quarter foremilk samples (1,574) were collected for bacteriological analysis from 40 cows during late lactation, early involution, prior to parturition, parturition, and during early lactation. Six of 160 quarters were infected with major pathogens during late lactation. Twelve new infections occurred during early involution. Twenty-two quarters were infected at parturition. Of these infections, 12 occurred after early involution, and 10 infections that originated during early involution persisted throughout the dry period. During early lactation, 21 major pathogen infections were observed. Nine occurred after calving, and 12 persisted from parturition. Most major pathogen infections (93.8%) were caused by coliforms and streptococcal species other than Streptococcus agalactiae. Numbers of streptococcal infections were highest at parturition and early lactation. Numbers of quarters infected with coliforms were similar during early involution, parturition, and early lactation. Coagulase negative staphylococcal infections increased during the dry period, whereas Corynebacterium bovis infected quarters decreased. Udder infections were few in cows completing first or second dry periods. The incidence of udder infection was highest in cows completing third or later dry periods.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. fecalis, S. sanguis, S. bovis, S. mitior, S. agalactiae, Escherichia coli, A-D group, Klebsiella aerogenes, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Pasteurella multocida or Listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. Two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. The analysis detected the growth of S. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and species of Micrococcus, Corynebacterium or Bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new injectable cephamycin antibiotic, was studied for its antibacterial activity, concentration in serum and urine, penetration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as clinical application. The following results were obtained. 1. Antibacterial activity: The susceptibilities of clinically isolated K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae to T-1982 were superior to those of CEZ CMZ, and ABPC. T-1982 seemed to be useful for various infections due to Gram-negative rods. 2. Concentration in serum and urine: Subjects were 10 children with congenital heart failure but no abnormal renal and liver functions. T-1982 was given intravenously to 3 groups at 200 mg/kg by one shot (4 cases), 20 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases) and 10 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion (3 cases). The half-lives were 60, 78 and 85 minutes, respectively. 3. Penetration into cerebrospinal fluid: Three children with malignant tumor were injected 20 mg/kg intravenously. A small amount of T-1982 was penetrated into CSF. 4. Clinical efficacy: T-1982 was administered daily 40-116 mg/kg t.i.d. or q.i.d. for 2-14 days to 17 children comprising 1 bronchopneumonia, 1 bronchitis, 4 tonsillitis, 1 lymphadenitis, 1 sepsis, 1 pharyngitis, 1 impetigo, 1 acute sinusitis and 6 pyelonephritis. Clinical efficacy was excellent in 10, good in 2, fair and poor in 3, and the efficacy rate was 70.6%. Bacteriological effect was as follows; eradicated in 9 cases and unknown in 8 cases. As side effect, GOT and GPT elevations unrelated to the drug were observed in 2 cases. Other abnormal findings were not found. T-1982 seems to be safe antibiotic in the field of pediatrics.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone) in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, was basically and clinically studied in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. The antibacterial activity of T-1982 was compared with that of CEZ, CMZ and ABPC. T-1982 was more active than the other drugs against Gram-negative bacteria, the sensitivity of E. coli (22 strains), K. pneumoniae (18 strains), P. mirabilis (19 strains), P. vulgaris (4 strains), P. morganii (5 strains) and K. oxytoca (4 strains) distributing less than 0.39, 0.1, 1.56, 0.39, 6.25 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. Two of 3 strains of C. freundii were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. Against Gram-positive bacteria, the activity of T-1982 was inferior to that of the other drugs. S. pyogenes (28 strains) were inhibited by 0.78 microgram/ml or less, but the sensitivity of S. aureus (34 strains distributed 12.5-100 micrograms/ml). 2. T-1982 was administered to each 3 children at a dose of 20 mg/kg by one shot intravenous injection or 1 hour drip infusion, or at dose of 40 mg/kg by 1 hour drip infusion. The mean serum levels at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after one shot intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg were respectively 74.3, 56.3, 42.3, 17.6, 5.7 and 1.2 micrograms/ml with the mean half-life of 1.01 hours. The values were 32.9, 50.0, 73.7, 27.5, 12.4 and 4.5 micrograms/ml and 1.31 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 20 mg/kg and 50.4, 104.7, 136.3, 62.3, 18.6 and 6.9 micrograms/ml and 1.16 hours by intravenous drip infusion of 40 mg/kg. The mean urinary recovery rates within 6 hours were 47.7, 67.6 and 60.9%, respectively. 3. Treatment with T-1982 was made in 28 cases of pediatric infections; 1 case of acute bronchitis, 19 cases of acute bronchopneumonia or lobar pneumonia, 2 cases of acute purulent cervical lymphadenitis, 4 cases of acute pyelonephritis and each 1 case of subcutaneous abscess and suspected bacterial endocarditis. The clinical responses assessed in 27 cases were excellent in 21 cases, good in 5 cases and poor in 1 case, the efficacy rate being 96.3%. Bacteriologically, 2 strains of S. aureus, 3 strains of S. pneumoniae, 4 strains of H. influenzae, 2 strains of E. coli and 1 strain of P. mirabilis were eradicated. One strain of S. faecalis was reduced. No side effects were observed in any cases. Slight elevation of GOT and GPT and that of GOT were noted in each 1 case.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies on T-1982 (cefbuperzone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Studies on T-1982 (cefbuperazone), a new cephamycin antibiotic, were carried out  in the field of pediatrics, and the following results were obtained. 1. Peak MIC of T-1982 against S. pyogenes (group A) lately isolated was 0.39 micrograms/ml, and the drug was active even against highly resistant strains of macrolides, lincomycin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. 2. Peak MICs of T-1982 were 0.78 microgram/ml against B. pertussis, 0.2 microgram/ml against E. coli and less than or equal to 0.05 microgram/ml against K. oxytoca, and the drug was also active against ampicillin-resistant bacteria. 3. Serum levels and urinary excretions of T-1982 were investigated in 6 cases. When given at a dose of 20-28 mg/kg by 1 hour intravenous drip infusion, serum concentrations of T-1982 attained the peak level of 63.5-75.9 micrograms/ml at the end of administration and sustained the level of 0.9-2.6 micrograms/ml at 6 hours, the serum half-life (T 1/2) ranging 70-82 minutes. Approximately 20-72% of the dose were excreted in the active form into urine within 6 hours. 4. Twenty-seven cases of acute pediatric infections were treated with T-1982 mainly by intravenous drip infusion, and satisfactory clinical results were obtained in all the cases of angina lacunaris, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, pertussis, sepsis caused by Serratia and acute urinary tract infections caused by ampicillin-resistant E. coli. The efficacy rate was 96.3%. In this study the drug was administered chiefly at a daily dose of 50-70 mg/kg 2-3 times a day for 2-12 days. 5. Gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes) and Gram-negative rods (H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae P. vulgaris, B. pertussis, S. marcescens, E. coli) were eradicated by the treatment with T-1982. 6. No noticeable side effects were observed, except for temporary increase of eosinophil in 2 cases and slight elevation of GOT in 1 case.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cefotiam against clinical isolates in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of cefotiam (CTM) against clinically isolated organisms in the field of obstetrics and gynecology was discussed as follows: In the point of view of the MICs peak, CTM was 1-fold worse than CEZ against Gram-positive bacteria, while, in the case of the concentration of CTM required to inhibit the growth of 80% or 90% of the total number of tested Gram-positive organism, antibacterial activity of CTM was approximately identical with that of CEZ, CMZ or SBPC. CTM against E. coli, K, pneumoniae, P. Mirabilis was 16-32-fold more effective than CEZ and 4-16-fold than CMZ. Against indole-positive organisms with CEZ was no effective, CTM was considerably effective. But antibacterial activity of CTM against B. fragilis was insufficient. However, in the case that no spore forming anaerobic organism involved in infectious disease, it is said that existence of aerobic organism is important. As E. coli is representative of aerobic organism, CTM with potent antibacterial activity against this organism is seemed to be effective antibiotic for the gynecological infection.

TI  - Prostaglandin cytoprotection and lysosomal stability in acute canine gastric erosions.
AB  - Prostaglandin cytoprotection may be related to lysosomal stability. In six mongrel dogs, bacterial peritonitis was created by the intraperitoneal instillation of Bacteroides fragilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Klebsiella pneumoniae in addition to canine gallbladder bile. In three dogs, gallbladder bile alone was instilled. Three of the six dogs with bacterial peritonitis also received 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (0.2 micrograms/kg intramuscularly q6h) 24 hours before and for 3 days after the induction of peritonitis. In the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving PGE2, gastroscopic examination demonstrated acute fundic erosions. None of the other dogs developed acute gastric erosions. In the dogs with bacterial peritonitis not receiving PGE2, fundic mucosal biopsy specimens demonstrated decreased lysosomal stability. In the dogs receiving PGE2, lysosomal stability was similar to that in the animals with bile peritonitis. These experiments demonstrate that PGE2 prevents the development of acute gastric erosions by stabilizing lysosomal membranes.

TI  - Multicentered clinical evaluation of cefoperazone for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Adult patients with bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract were given either cefoperazone or cefamandole in a multicenter clinical study of the clinical and bacteriologic efficacy of cefoperazone. Clinical diagnoses included pneumonia, bronchitis, lung abscess, and bronchiectasis. Efficacy was evaluated in 119 patients given cefoperazone and 73 patients given cefamandole. Major pathogens isolated included Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Satisfactory clinical responses were noted for 96% of the patients in both treatment groups, including 14 of 17 patients given cefoperazone who were primarily infected with P. aeruginosa. Satisfactory bacteriologic responses were noted for 88% of the group given cefoperazone and 89% of the group given cefamandole. Adverse reactions related to the antibiotic occurred infrequently in each treatment group. The results of this study indicate that cefoperazone is a safe and effective antibiotic for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections due to S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, and many gram-negative bacilli, including susceptible strains of P. aeruginosa, in adult patients.
TI  - [The antibacterial activity of new cephem antibiotics against clinical isolates.  A comparison of the antibacterial activity of cefotaxime with 6 other antibiotics].
AB  - During the period from May through July 1981, a comparative study was carried out on the antibacterial activities of cefotaxime (CTX) and ceftizoxime (CZX), cefoperazone (CPZ), latamoxef (LMOX), cefotiam (CTM), cefmetazole (CMZ) and cefazolin (CEZ). CTX and these other cephem antibiotics were tested against fresh clinical isolates which had been obtained from clinical materials by the laboratories of 14 participating medical institutions. 1. The clinical isolates were obtained from various clinical materials in the following decreasing order: urine, sputum and pus/discharge; 85.7% of the isolates came from these materials. 2. Concerning the sources of each species of clinical isolates, it was found that P. aeruginosa was isolated from the greatest number -9- of different clinical materials. This was followed by E. coli and E. cloacae, each isolated from 8 different clinical materials, and C. freundii and E. aerogenes, each found in 7 different clinical materials. 3. In relation to S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae and S. pneumoniae, CTX showed the best antibacterial activity; the second most potent antibiotic was CZX. CMZ and LMOX were found to show relatively high MIC values for those species. Against S. aureus, CEZ showed the best antibacterial activity, but 3 resistant strains had MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 4. With regard to Gram-negative bacteria, CTX and CZX showed the best antibacterial activities for all of the species, except for P. aeruginosa. These were followed, in order, by LMOX and CPZ. Compared with these 4 antibiotics, CTM, CMZ and CEZ were found to have inferior antibacterial activities against these bacteria. In relation to P. aeruginosa, the peak of the MIC distribution for CPZ was 6.25 micrograms/ml, and this was the best antibacterial activity detected with the various antibiotics tested. This was followed by CTX (25 micrograms/ml) LMOX (25 micrograms/ml) and CZX (50 micrograms/ml). CTM had an MIC of 100 micrograms/ml for 1 strain, and MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml for all of the other strains of P. aeruginosa, indicating them to be resistant to this antibiotic. All of the strains were resistant to CMZ and CEZ, showing MICs of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. 5. For each of the tested antibiotics, no correlation was found between the MIC and the serogroup for either P. aeruginosa or S. marcescens.
TI  - The clinical significance of positive blood cultures: a comprehensive analysis of 500 episodes of bacteremia and fungemia in adults. I. Laboratory and epidemiologic observations.
AB  - Five hundred episodes of septicemia were reviewed, with emphasis on laboratory and epidemiologic findings. The isolation of facultative and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, fungi, and gram-positive cocci (except viridans streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis) almost always indicated true bacteremia, whereas the isolation of aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacilli, including Clostridium species, often represented contamination. More than 99% of all episodes were detected when two samples of blood (a total of 30 ml) were cultured. The five most common isolates were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of septicemia was highest among medical patients and lowest among obstetric-gynecologic patients. Two-thirds of all episodes were nosocomial; S. aureus, enterococci, facultative gram-negative bacilli, and fungi were especially common nosocomial pathogens. The microorganisms isolated varied with the hospital service; polymicrobial episodes were especially common among surgical patients and transplant recipients. The most common sources of bacteremia were the respiratory, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tracts; however, the source was unknown in nearly one-third of episodes. Microorganisms causing septicemia in neutropenic and nonneutropenic patients were not different; however, polymicrobial infections were more frequent in the presence of neutropenia. After antimicrobial susceptibility data became available, therapy was appropriate greater than 90% of the time.
TI  - What do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  - beta-Lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. Both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which are primarily cephalosporinases are important. The use of penicillins to treat Haemophilus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of beta-lactamase producing strains. In the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to Enterobacter, Serratia and Bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. Although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some Pseudomonas and Enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. It is only in some Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.
TI  - Clinical trial of bacampicillin in acute bacterial infections.
AB  - A clinical trial of bacampicillin was carried out in 20 patients. The antibiotic  was found to be effective in acute lobar pneumonia, pyogenic meningitis, acute and chronic bronchitis, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, cellulitis, furunculosis, and pyomyositis caused by such ampicillin-sensitive organisms as Neisseria meningitidis, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Rash in three patients was the only side effect encountered. It is concluded that while bacampicillin may have overcome some of the disadvantages of ampicillin, it retains its main attributes and some shortcomings.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of cefmenoxime: a new cephalosporin. In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities and pharmacokinetic properties.
AB  - Cefmenoxime is a new syn-methoxyimino cephalosporin antibiotic derived from cefotiam, which has been proved to be a very effective and useful antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory infections. This bacteriological and pharmacokinetic study was therefore performed in order to evaluate the potency of cefmenoxime in the treatment of respiratory infections. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of cefmenoxime against 179 isolates of respiratory pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae 53, Haemophilus influenzae 64, Klebsiella pneumoniae 43, Escherichia coli 9, Enterobacter spp. 10) were less than 0.20 micrograms/ml, and 43 (73%) of 60 Pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by 12.5 micrograms/ml. In vitro antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime was superior to 18 other antibiotics, including cefotiam and cefotaxime tested in this study. Pharmacokinetic studies on tissue distribution in rats, serum levels and urinary excretion in 3 healthy volunteers, and penetration into bronchial secretes of 9 patients with respiratory infections, revealed that cefmenoxime has a higher penetration into the lung and bronchial secretes compared with cefotiam and cefotaxime. In 1 patient with chronic bronchiolitis, the concentration of cefmenoxime in the intra-bronchial secrete reached 12.5 micrograms/ml. From these results, it is concluded that cefmenoxime is a highly potent and useful antibiotic, and may be more effective in the treatment of respiratory infections than many other cephalosporins, including cefazolin, cefotiam and cefotaxime.
TI  - Detection of fungemia obscured by concomitant bacteremia: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - Our recent clinical experience suggested that bacteremia may interfere with the detection of concomitant fungemia when standard blood culture methods are used. To determine the extent to which bacteria may interfere with fungal isolation from blood cultures, an in vitro model simulating blood cultures taken during concomitant fungemia and bacteremia was created. Each of six bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was combined with each of three pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, and Torulopsis glabrata) in vented blood culture bottles containing enriched brain heart infusion broth and fresh normal human blood. Blood culture bottles were analyzed at 1, 2, and 7 days of incubation. Gram strains and subcultures onto chocolate and MacConkey agars failed to detect fungi in 37.0, 66.7, and 100% of samples, respectively. However, subcultures onto Sabouraud dextrose agar failed in only 13% of the samples (occurring only with P. aeruginosa). In a rabbit model of concomitant fungemia with C. albicans and bacteremia with P. aeruginosa, no yeasts were recovered from blood cultures despite 100% detection of P. aeruginosa. Therefore, the usual microbiological techniques may be inadequate to detect fungemia when concomitant bacteremia is present.
TI  - Ruptured hepatic abscess: a rare cause of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum.
AB  - A 68-yr-old woman who developed an acute abdomen with clinical and radiological evidence of pneumoperitoneum is is described. At surgery, multiple left lobe hepatic abscesses were identified. Perforation of one abscess was apparent. Bacteriological studies revealed Streptococcus faecalis and gas-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from the abscess cavities. Spontaneous pneumoperitoneum secondary to a ruptured hepatic abscess has to our knowledge never been reported.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefmenoxime in the pediatric infections].
AB  - Cefmenoxime (CMX) was evaluated in 25 children with a suspicion of bacterial infection. Of the 20 confirmed bacterial infections, 19 were cured by CMX therapy (effective rate, 95%). The diagnoses included acute pharyngotonsillitis (4), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (7), streptococcal dacryocystitis (1), infections accompanied with acute leukemia (4), and acute urinary tract infections (3). The etiologic pathogens were beta-hemolytic Streptococcus group A (1), and F (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (4), Klebsiella pneumoniae (2), etc. CMX was very effective for 2 children with respiratory infections due to ampicillin resistant H. influenzae type b. The half life of serum concentration of CMX was 0.76 +/- 0.17 hour after an intravenous bolus injection. A cerebrospinal fluid level of CMX was 5.2 mcg/ml 1 hour after intravenous injection of 1 g (23.8 mg/kg) in a child with inflamed meninges. However this level was not as high as those of cefotaxime, latamoxef, or ceftizoxime measured in the same case. No severe adverse reaction was encountered with CMX therapy. The data suggest that CMX is a safe and effective parenteral antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - Occurrence of bacterial pollution indicators in Boulti (Tilapia nilotica Linn.) fish.
AB  - A study was made for the occurrence of coliform and streptococcal groups on the skin surface (32 samples), gills (32 samples), intestinal tract (4 samples) and raw fish flesh (4 samples) and raw fish flesh (4 samples) of Boulti fish (Tilapia nilotica Linn.), a fresh water fish caught from Nasser's Lake in Aswan. Streptococcus group was detected in 13 samples taken from fish surface, 12 samples out of 32 swabs from gills. All intestine samples and raw fish flesh were positive for the streptococcus group. Coliform organisms were detected at nearly 43% of skin or gill samples, 100% of intestine and raw fish flesh samples.
TI  - Determination of bacterial meningitis: a retrospective study of 80 cerebrospinal  fluid specimens evaluated by four in vitro methods.
AB  - A total of 80 cerebrospinal fluid specimens were analyzed for bacterial meningitis by four procedures readily available to most laboratories. These tests included routine culturing. Gram staining, countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, staphylococcal coagglutination (CoA) with laboratory-prepared reagents, and CoA with Pharmacia Diagnostics reagents. A total of 56 specimens were positive for bacterial agents by routine culturing: Gram stain results were positive for 64% of all specimens positive by culturing. For 36 specimens from patients with suspected meningitis due to either Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or group B streptococci, detection was 97% with Pharmacia CoA reagents, 94% with laboratory-prepared CoA reagents, 89% with routine culturing, 78% with countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis, and 75% with Gram staining. One specimen which contained Klebsiella pneumoniae was false positive for S. pneumoniae in tests with both of the CoA reagents and in countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis. A Gram stain of this specimen clearly showed gram-negative bacilli, which were confirmed by culturing. Although a positive culture and a positive Gram stain are definitive evidence of bacterial meningitis, rapid immunological tests can provide valuable clinical information as an adjunct to culture and Gram stain results. Serological tests with Pharmacia CoA reagents produced more positive results than either laboratory-prepared CoA reagents or countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis.

TI  - Treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis: role of the new cephalosporin antibiotics.
AB  - Results of the treatment of gram-negative bacillary meningitis have been disappointing: mortality is extremely high, and treatment with chloramphenicol has shown a high failure rate. This failure rate for chloramphenicol is consistent with the wide gap between minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of this drug for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and other Enterobacteriaceae. Cefotaxime, a new cephalosporin, is cidal for most gram-negative bacteria at concentrations of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. By late 1981, 137 patients with meningitis due to a variety of bacteria had been treated with this agent. Bacteriologic cure rates were 93% for meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae and 88% for meningitis due to gram-negative bacteria (94.4% for meningitis due to E. coli and Klebsiella). This new antibiotic shows considerable promise in the treatment of these forms of meningitis.
TI  - Clinical trials of cefotaxime for the treatment of bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The efficacy of cefotaxime sodium for treatment of patients with lower respiratory infections was evaluated by three protocols in multicenter trials. The first trial studied cefotaxime alone; the second and third trials compared cefotaxime with cefazolin in observer-blind and single-blind randomized controlled studies, respectively. A total of 656 patients were entered in the three trials; 527 received cefotaxime. Overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure, analyzed by pathogen, for the cefotaxime treated patients were 89.9% and 93.9%, respectively. In the two comparative trials, overall rates of bacteriologic and clinical cure with cefotaxime, by pathogen, were greater than 94% and numerically exceeded those for cefazolin in each instance. The efficacies in the comparative studies, when analyzed by total patient responses, were significantly different only for clinical responses to cefotaxime in the single-blind randomized trial (P = 0.03). Favorable cure rates with cefotaxime were obtained in patients with infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, and nearly comparable responses were obtained for infections due to Proteus, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella species. Cefotaxime was clinically effective in some of the infections due to Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but bacteriologic failures occurred in 67% and 61% of cases, respectively. All Serratia strains were highly susceptible in vitro to cefotaxime, but the range of minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefotaxime for Pseudomonas isolates was wide.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of cefmenoxime.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime, an aminothiazolyl cephalosporin, was studied against 650 bacteria. It was slightly less active than cefotaxime and more active than moxalactam against staphylococci. It had activity similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftizoxime against group A and B streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. It did not inhibit Streptococcus faecalis or Listeria spp. Cefmenoxime had activity similar to that of cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftazidime, and moxalactam against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella, and Shigella. It inhibited beta-lactamase-positive and -negative isolates at less than or equal to 0.4 microgram/ml. Cefmenoxime was somewhat less active than moxalactam or ceftizoxime against Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter agglomerans, but was more active than cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, or ceftazidime against Morganella (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, 0.1 microgram/ml.), Proteus vulgaris and Providencia spp. It was as active as ceftizoxime was against Serratia. Pseudomonas spp. and Bacteroides spp. were relatively resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates, greater than 100 micrograms/ml). The compound was stable to the common plasmid beta-lactamases, such as that of TEM. It was stable to most chromosomally mediated beta-lactamases, which act primarily as cephalosporinases, but was hydrolyzed by Bacteroides and Acinetobacter.

TI  - Use of a bronchoscopic protected catheter brush for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections.
AB  - Fiberoptic bronchoscopy using a protected brush catheter was done in 65 patients  with suspected pulmonary infections to obtain uncontaminated specimens for culture. Quantitative aerobic and anaerobic cultures were done on each specimen. Forty-one patients had pneumonia. Ten bacteremic patients had the same organisms recovered from the catheter and blood cultures. Seven patients had received antibiotics before the procedure, and cultures grew no organisms in high concentration. In 23 of 24 remaining patients probable pathogens were recovered in high concentrations, and specific therapy resulted in clinical improvement in all of these patients. Five patients with lung abscesses and seven with necrotizing pneumonia had mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms recovered. Twelve patients had final diagnoses of nonbacterial lung disease, and cultures were negative or revealed low concentrations of organisms. Quantitative cultures were necessary in distinguishing pathogens from nonpathogens. There were no complications. The results of this study indicate that fiberoptic bronchoscopy using a special protected catheter is an accurate and safe technique for identification of etiologic agents in lower respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Comparative review of two new wide-spectrum penicillins: mezlocillin and piperacillin.
AB  - The antimicrobial spectra, pharmacokinetics, tissue penetration, side effects, clinical trials and indications, dosage, and cost of mezlocillin (Mezlin) and piperacillin (Pipracil), two new semisynthetic beta-lactam penicillins, are reviewed. Both mezlocillin and piperacillin are active against a wider range of bacteria than previously available penicillins, but their spectra are not identical. Piperacillin is more active than mezlocillin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa; their activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, and Bacteroides fragilis are similar to one another. Neither drug is absorbed orally; both are well absorbed (60-70%) after i.m. injection. Following i.v. infusion or injection, both drugs distribute rapidly (distribution half-life = 10-20 min); neither is protein bound substantially. Both drugs are primarily excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Elimination half-lives of both drugs are slightly prolonged in renal-failure patients. However, the half-life of mezlocillin in renal failure is longer then the half-life of piperacillin because of dose-dependent kinetics of mezlocillin at low glomecular filtration rates. Probenecid alters the disposition of both drugs. Both drugs are widely distributed throughout the body. Reported side effects are similar to those of other penicillins. Mezlocillin and piperacillin may be used to treat susceptible organisms causing the following conditions: complicated and uncomplicated urinary-tract infections, septicemia, uncomplicated gonococcal urethritis, and lower respiratory-tract, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, skin, and skin-structure infections. Piperacillin is also effective for bone and joint infections. Dosages of both antibiotics should be adjusted based on patients' clinical condition and renal status. Both agents are relatively expensive in comparison with older penicillins and cephalosporins; their daily costs are similar to third-generation cephalosporins, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin. The potential benefits of mezlocillin and piperacillin are in their extended in vitro spectra of activity and minimal toxicities. More comparative clinical trials are needed to support any claims of clinical superiority of these drugs over older, less expensive regimens.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary meningitis. New therapy and changing concepts.
AB  - Because the CSF is deficient in opsonic and phagocytic activity, optimal therapy  for meningitis mandates the use of antibiotics that are bactericidal at achievable CSF concentrations. This therapeutic principles is satisfied for the common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) but is not readily achieved for the pathogens causing Gram-negative bacillary meningitis (GNBM), such as Klebsiella and Escherichia coli. The antibiotics used to treat GNBM, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides, are not bactericidal against enteric pathogens at achievable CSF levels. Two new beta-lactam antibiotics, moxalactam disodium and cefotaxime sodium, are suitable agents for the treatment of GNBM. These antibiotics possess potent bactericidal activity against most enteric pathogens and achieve high levels in the CSF (15 to 35 micrograms/mL for moxalactam disodium and 2 to 10 micrograms/mL for cefotaxime sodium). Recent clinical studies document an 85% cure rate when these agents are used to treat GNBM.
TI  - Additional correlations of chemical structure and immunological specificity among cross-reactions of pneumococci and Klebsiella.
AB  
TI  - Rapid differentiation of bacterial meningitides by direct gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - Rapid identification of Haemophilus influenzae and other bacillary meningitides was attempted by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of the metabolic by-products in broth cultures and in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained from experimental meningitis produced in New Zealand White male rabbits. These results were correlated with the GLC of CSF of meningitis patients. A major peak with retention time of succinic acid was found in the broth cultures of all bacilli tested including H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes. Succinic acid was also found in the CSF of experimental meningitis and in the CSF of all patients with H. influenzae and Esch. coli meningitis. This peak was not detected in the blood samples of experimental animals. It was also absent in the broth cultures of all of the gram-positive and gram-negative cocci tested, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. Succinic acid, which appears to be a by product of fermentation, persisted as a clear cut marker in H. influenzae meningitis for at least 3 d after the initiation of treatment. In one patient, the succinic acid peak disappeared during treatment and reappeared with a clinical relapse. Clearly, the presence of succinic acid that can be rapidly detected by GLC in the CSF excludes pneumococcal or meningococcal meningitis and strongly suggests H. influenzae or other bacillary meningitides.
TI  - Increased bactericidal activity of dilute preparations of povidone-iodine solutions.
AB  - Recent confirmation of intrinsic bacterial contamination of 10% povidone-iodine solution has raised questions regarding the bactericidal mechanism of iodophors and the possibility for survival of vegetative bacterial cells in iodophor solutions. In this laboratory investigation, five different species were exposed to various dilutions of three commercial preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution; survival was assessed after exposure for time periods varying between 0 and 8 min. All brands of povidone-iodine solution tested demonstrated more rapid killing of Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium chelonei at dilutions of 1:2, 1:4, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 than did the stock solutions, S. aureus survived a 2-min exposure to full-strength povidone-iodine solution but did not survive a 15-s exposure to a 1:100 dilution of the iodophor. Both stock and dilute preparations of 10% povidone-iodine solution demonstrated rapid bactericidal action against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Streptococcus mitis.
TI  - Blood culture cross contamination associated with a radiometric analyzer.
AB  - During a 9-day period in August 1980 in a New Jersey hospital, three pairs of consecutively numbered blood cultures from different patients were identified as positive for the same organism (two pairs of Klebsiella pneumoniae and one pair of group A Streptococcus), for each pair, both cultures were positive in the same atmosphere, both organisms had the same sensitivities, and the second of each pair grew at least 2 days after the first and was the only positive blood culture obtained from the patient. When the hospital laboratory discontinued use of its radiometric culture analyzer for 15 days, no more consecutive pairs of positive cultures occurred. Subsequent use of the machine for 9 days with a new power unit but the original circuit boards resulted in one more similar consecutive pair (Staphylococcus epidermidis). After replacement of the entire power unit, there were no further such pairs. Examination of the machine by the manufacturer revealed a defective circuit board which resulted in inadequate needle sterilization. Laboratories which utilize radiometric analyzers should be aware of the potential for cross contamination. Recognition of such events requires alert microbiologists and infection control practitioners and a record system in the bacteriology laboratory designed to identify such clusters.
TI  - [Multicenter study on the status of antibiotic and chemotherapy resistance in Switzerland 1979].
AB  - In 1979 a three-month multicentre study of resistance of bacteria isolated from humans and animals was carried out in Switzerland with the participation of 22 institutes and laboratories. A total of 23,852 antibiograms were evaluated concerning the following bacteria: Escherichia coi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus (indole-negative), Proteus (indole-positive), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci (streptococci of Group D). 95.5% of the strains were isolated from human material, almost half being isolated from urine. The remaining 4.5% were obtained from animal material, more than half being isolated from the milk of cows with mastitis. Although the various institutes and laboratories did not use a uniform, standardized method, the results are closely in line with those of similar studies carried out earlier in Switzerland, Germany, Austria and the USA. No pronounced trend in the direction of increased resistance is observable.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - Hematogenous infection of peritoneovenous shunts after dental procedures.
AB  - In two patients who had peritoneovenous shunts inserted for the treatment of intractable ascites, the shunt became infected following dental procedures that were carried out without antibiotic prophylaxis. The organisms grown were alpha-hemolytic streptococcus in one patient, and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the other. Alpha hemolytic streptococcus is commonly found in the oral cavity and has also been found, related to dental manipulations, in hematogenous infections at other sites. In both patients the infections were successfully managed by antibiotic treatment with removal of the infected shunt. Physicians caring for patients with peritoneovenous shunts should be aware of this potential complication; antibiotics should always be given prophylactically at the time of dental procedures.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftriaxone in serious bacterial infections.
AB  - Ceftriaxone is a new semisynthetic cephalosporin with broad-spectrum in vitro activity and an unusually long serum half-life. The clinical efficacy of ceftriaxone was evaluated in 35 infections in 34 patients; 12 of these patients had skin and soft tissue infections, 10 had infections of the urinary tract, 8 had pneumonia, 2 had biliary tract infections, 1 had sinusitis, 1 had diverticulitis, and 1 had a retroperitoneal abscess. Of the 35 infections, 9 were bacteremic. The bacteria isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, other streptococcal species, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, other Bacteroides species, and anaerobic cocci. Improvement or cure occurred in 32 episodes, for a response rate of 91%. There were three treatment failures in patients with soft tissue infections. No serious drug toxicities were observed. At a dosage regimen of 1 g every 12 h the peak and trough serum antibiotic concentrations were well above the minimal inhibitory concentrations of most pathogens. Our findings suggest that ceftriaxone is a safe and effective antibiotic for therapy of serious bacterial infections.
TI  - Quantitative pyrolysis gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of bacterial cell walls.
AB  
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin against gram-positive  and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species and its beta-lactamase stability.
AB  - The in vitro activity of N-formimidoyl thienamycin was determined against 800 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activity of cefoxitin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, cefoperazone, and gentamicin. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin inhibited the majority of organisms at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml. It inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. It inhibited beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Unlike other new beta-lactams, it inhibited Listeria. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacters, Serratia, indole-positive Proteus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides resistant to other agents were inhibited. There was minimal effect of inoculum size and aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and serum had no effect on activity. Most minimal bactericidal concentrations were two- or fourfold greater than the minimal inhibitory concentration. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin showed partial synergy with aminoglycosides against S. aureus, S. faecalis, and many Pseudomonas and Enterobacteriaceae. It was not hydrolyzed by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases.
TI  - Influence of bacterial products on the motility of stallion spermatozoa.
AB  - Sterile filtrates were prepared from equine isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (genitalium), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equisimilis, Actinobacillus equuli, and Corynebacterium equi and mixed individually with extended stallion semen. When diluted in the extended semen the filtrates represented bacterial populations of 0.5 x 10(6), 1 x 10(6), 2 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells/ml. pH values were recorded for each filtrate. Specimens were monitored for percentage motile spermatozoa at 30-min intervals until they reached 10% or less for 2 consecutive observations. All specimens were maintained at 25 degrees C in a water bath. Ten specimens were examined from each of 5 clinically normal stallions. The major reduction in percentage motile spermatozoa as compared to the control sample occurred before the first observation. From this point the rate of deterioration in motility in the filtrates approximated that of the control. The differences detected between the filtrates and control in percentage motile sperm cells were all statistically significant at P less than 0.01.
TI  - Effects of washing on the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis.
AB  - Six stallions were subjected to extensive cleansing of the penis and prepuce with water, Ivory Soap and water, or Betadine surgical scrub and water. The stallions were all washed for 14 days, and then allowed 14 days respite. This pattern of washing and resting was repeated consecutively. Swabs were taken from all 7 stallions twice weekly and semen was collected once a week for bacteriological examination. All forms of cleansing altered the bacterial flora of the stallion's penis; the Ivory Soap tended to encourage the replacement of the normal flora with coliform organisms, while Betadine favoured the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. This experiment showed that the systematic washing of a stallion's penis will cause the normal flora to be replaced with pathogens and potential pathogens.
TI  - Ceftazidime in the treatment of urinary tract infection.
AB  - Twenty-nine patients with urinary tract infection were treated with ceftazidime intramuscularly, at a dosage of 1000 mg twice daily for 7 days. The patient series was predominantly geriatric, with a mean age of 70.9 years and including 17 patients over 75 years. Nine had an in-dwelling catheter and azotaemia was found in 14 cases. In this clinically difficult group, a positive bacteriological response to treatment was obtained in 72.9% and, if patients with in-dwelling catheters are excluded, 90% were cured. Ceftazidime-resistant Streptococcus faecalis was cultured before treatment in 6 of the 8 unsuccessful cases. In the remaining 2 treatment failures, Streptococcus faecalis was isolated immediately after treatment. In terms of clinical response to therapy all patients were cured or improved. Treatment with ceftazidime was well tolerated. No subjective side-effects occurred. One patient developed a distinct but transient elevation of liver enzymes, and in 2 cases a negative direct Coombs test was temporarily positive.
TI  - Pivmecillinam in complicated urinary infections failing to respond to conventional therapy.
AB  - Forty-three patients with a history of recurrent urinary infections, many of whom had renal involvement and had recently failed treatment, were then treated with pivmecillinam (400 mg 8-hourly for seven days). One week after the end of treatment the bacteriological cure rate was 72.1%. During the following four weeks, however, several of the cured patients relapsed, so that the cure rate five weeks after the end of treatment was only 46%. Thus, it is recommended that such patients should begin prophylactic treatment if found to be abacteriuric after the one week follow-up. Pivmecillinam was extremely well tolerated.
TI  - Study of the mode of action of ribosomal vaccines from Klebsiella and Streptococcus pneumoniae and their ribonucleic and protein fractions using passive immunization.
AB  - The vaccinating potency of ribosomal fractions of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as their ribosomal RNA and protein fractions has been studied with respect to their ability to induce cellular or humoral immunity. Experiments with transfer of serum or spleen cells from vaccinated animals have shown that anti-Klebsiella immunity is essentially cellular, while streptococcal immunity is exclusively humoral. Results have been discussed as a function of differential results for the various fractions under study.
TI  - Type-specific vs. cross-protective vaccination for gram-negative bacterial pneumonia.
AB  - Groups of guinea pigs received four injections intramuscularly of lipopolysaccharide vaccine derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cross-protective core glycolipid vaccine derived from the J-5 mutant of Escherichia coli O111, or saline during a two-week period. Titers of passive hemagglutinating antibody to vaccine antigens in serum routinely increased fourfold or more. Experimental hemorrhagic pseudomonas pneumonia was then induced, from which the rates of survival were 15% among animals receiving saline, 81% among animals receiving pseudomonas vaccine (P less than 0.001), and 42% among animals receiving J-5 vaccine. Thus, only weak cross-protection against pseudomonas pneumonia was detected in the recipients of J-5 vaccine. Further studies revealed no protection against pneumonia due to either E. coli or Klebsiella in animals receiving J-5 vaccine. From these data, species-specific vaccination appears to be superior to vaccination with cross-protective antigen against experimental pseudomonas pneumonia.
TI  - Immunochemical relations between pneumococcal group 19 and Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides.
AB  - Pneumococcal type 19F polysaccharide, contained in the current U.S. licensed pneumococcal vaccine, is a poor immunogen in young children. Capsular polysaccharides of Klebsiella, reported to be cross-reactive with the pneumococcal type 19F, were isolated. Immunochemical relations between pneumococcal group 19 and Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides were studied by immunodiffusion with hyperimmune typing antisera, immune passive hemolysis, and plaque-forming cell response in mice following injection of polysaccharides. Klebsiella K2, K9, K32, K47, and K48 polysaccharides were reported to cross-react with horse pneumococcal type 19 antiserum by direct precipitation. However, these Klebsiella polysaccharides did not react in immunodiffusion with horse or with rabbit pneumococcal 19F and 19A typing antisera. Furthermore, pneumococcal type 19F and 19A polysaccharides did not precipitate with rabbit K2, K9, K32, K47, and K49 typing antisera. The cross-reactivity of the Klebsiella and pneumococcal polysaccharides was studied by 2 other methods. Rabbit pneumococcal 19F antiserum induced by low passive hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes coated with Klebsiella polysaccharides. In contrast, Klebsiella typing antisera exhibited higher hemolytic activity with erythrocytes coated with type 19F polysaccharides. The cross-reactivity of K2 and pneumococcal 19F polysaccharides was also exhibited by the direct IgM plaque-forming cell response. The cross-reactivity, determined by precipitin reactions using animal antisera, may not predict the cross-immunogenicity of purified polysaccharides in humans.
TI  - Peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with LeVeen shunts.
AB  - Six cirrhotic patients are described in whom peritonitis developed from 10 days to 15 months after the insertion of a LeVeen shunt. The presenting clinical features of fever, increasing ascites and deterioration in mental status resembled these previously reported for cirrhotic patients but with spontaneous peritonitis without shunts. Important differences were observed, however, in microbiology, incidence of bacteremia and therapy. Staphylococcus aureus, a rare cause of spontaneous peritonitis, was found in one half of our cases, suggesting that perioperative contamination during shunt placement was an important etiologic factor. All six had concomitant bacteremia which may be attributable to the direct peritoneal-venous connection. Appropriate systemic antimicrobial therapy without shunt removal failed to eradicate the infection irrespective of the patency of the shunt or absence of inflammation at the sites of insertion. Recommended treatment for suspected peritonitis in patients with shunts is systemic antimicrobial therapy with an agent active against staphylococci plus an aminoglycoside, followed by removal of the shunt if the diagnosis is confirmed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin derivative.
AB  - DL 473, a new semisynthetic rifamycin, was 2-10 times more active in vitro than rifampicin (RAMP) against several clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and only slightly less active than RAMP against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It showed excellent therapeutic activity in mice in experimental infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes group A, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In the experimental TB infection in the mouse DL 473 was clearly more active than isoniazide and RAMP, two of the most effective antitubercular drugs in current use. The LD50 in the mouse was significantly higher than that of RAMP and the half-life was about 5 times longer than that of RAMP.
TI  - Causes of pneumonia presenting to a district general hospital.
AB  - The incidence of bacterial, viral, mycoplasma, and rickettsial infections has been assessed prospectively in 210 adult patients with pneumonia who presented to a district hospital over a six-year period. One hundred and thirteen infective agents were detected in 103 patients. The agent most frequently detected was Mycoplasma pneumoniae which accounted for 30 infections. A bacterial pathogen was found in 43 patients. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common of these (24 patients); Staphylococcus aureus (eight), Haemophilus influenzae (four), Klebsiella spp (three), and Legionella pneumophila (three) were all less common. Chlamydial or rickettsial infections (Psittacosis or Q fever) were detected in nine patients. Viral infections were found in 31 patients (22 influenza A, four influenza B, two parainfluenza, and three respiratory syncytial virus). There were 10 patients in whom more than one pathogen was identified. In 107 patients no pathogens could be identified. Seventy-five per cent of these patients had either received antibiotics before entering hospital, or were unable to produce any sputum for culture. The incidence of bacterial pneumonia has probably therefore been underestimated. Nevertheless this survey does emphasise the importance of M pneumoniae as a pathogen in patients with pneumonia presenting to hospital.
TI  - Comparative in vitro study in new cephalosporins.
AB  - Three new cephalosporins, ceftazidime, ceftizoxime, and cefotiam, were evaluated  in vitro against clinical isolates, and their activities were compared with those of other cephalosporins, mezlocillin, and tobramycin. All three new cephalosporins were very active against gram-positive cocci (except enterococci), but mezlocillin was more active against Streptococcus ssp. Cefotiam and cefamandole were the most active antibiotics against Streptococcus aureus. Ceftazidime had broad-spectrum activity against all gram-negative bacilli tested, except Enterobacter spp. Ceftizoxime was active against all, except Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although cefotiam was quite active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, it was inactive against indole-positive Proteus spp., Serratia spp, and P. aeruginosa. The in vitro activity suggests that ceftazidime should prove useful as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, in those settings in which the most likely pathogens are gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - In vivo activity of ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904), a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic  cephalosporin.
AB  - Ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904) was compared with other newer beta-lactam antibiotics for activity in experimental infections of mice with Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and gram-positive bacteria. Overall, ceftriaxone was equal or superior to cefotaxime and cefoperazone against systemic infections. All three drugs were highly potent against most organisms but were considerably less active against P. aeruginosa. However, ceftriaxone tended to be more active than the other two agents against 8 of the 10 P. aeruginosa strains tested. Ceftriaxone, cefmenoxime (SCE 1365), and moxalactam were all highly active against systemic infections with 16 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, whereas ceftriaxone was more active against infections with two strains of streptococci. When the drugs were administered at various time intervals before infection, ceftriaxone was superior to cefotaxime, cefmenoxime, and moxalactam. This suggested that ceftriaxone might be eliminated from mice more slowly than the other drugs. In the case of cefotaxime, this was directly confirmed by microbiological assays of plasma samples. In a murine meningitis model induced by Klebsiella pneumoniae or Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin or cefotaxime. Ceftriaxone was more active than ampicillin, cefotaxime, piperacillin, cefamandole, or carbenicillin in a pneumococcal, pneumonia model in mice. These studies indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with unusual pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Clinicobacteriological study of pneumonia.
AB  
TI  - Patterns of oropharyngeal and fecal flora in patients with acute leukemia.
AB  - The oropharyngeal and fecal flora in 33 patients hospitalized with acute leukemia was examined. Normal flora predominated on admission. All patients received chemotherapy during the 48 hr after admission and at least one course of antibiotics during hospitalization. By the end of the study, 68% of the initial normal throat flora and 57% of the fecal flora had disappeared. The shift in flora was mainly due to the persistence or acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli. Before antibiotics were given, the normal flora in both sites had already decreased in quantity, and increased numbers of aerobic gram-negative bacilli were found. After the first course of antibiotics, a further decrease in the total number of normal strains was observed. Information obtained from surveillance cultures was helpful for understanding the changes in flora but did not correlate with the microbiology of the infectious processes and could not be used to predict infection.
TI  - Pathological study of infective endocarditis on Hancock porcine bioprostheses.
AB  - A pathological study has been performed on 10 infected Hancock bioprostheses removed from nine patients who died of prosthetic endocarditis. The devices had been in place from 2 to 87 months (average 37.5), the interval between operation and onset of infection averaging 30 months. The offending organisms were Gram negative bacteria in three patients (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Serratia marcescens), Gram positive bacteria in two (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans), and fungi in four (Candida species in three and Aspergillus species in one). Gross examination of the explants revealed in most cases a vegetative endocarditis of one porcine valve leaflets. Septic embolization occurred in five cases owing to the high friability of the vegetations. Prosthetic valve incompetence was the commonest type to dysfunction observed because of tears, perforations, and even complete destruction of the cusps. Prosthetic valve stenosis following obstruction of the valve orifice by infected polypous masses was noted in two cases. Clumps of infective organisms were detected deep in the cusp tissue in most cases on histologic examination. Infection located on the paraprosthetic tissues, associated with ring abscess, valve detachment, and insufficiency, was observed only once. According to the results of investigation, endocarditis on porcine bioprostheses is associated with a better preserved native valvular ring as viewed at reoperation. Therefore surgical intervention appears appropriate in the presence of severe hemodynamic complications after adequate antibiotic treatment. However, infection of these particular prostheses still carries an extremely high mortality. In the present series, this poor outcome might be explained by the frequently associated septic and thromboembolic events.
TI  - Effect of solar radiation and predacious microorganisms on survival of fecal and  other bacteria.
AB  - The effect of solar radiation and predacious microorganisms on the survival of bacteria of fecal and plant origin was studied. The decline in the numbers of Escherichia coli cells in estuarine water samples was found to be significantly greater in the presence of both naturally occurring microbial predators and solar radiation than when each of these factors was acting independently. The effect of solar radiation on microbial predators was negligible, whereas the susceptibility of bacteria to light-induced decay varied from one organism to another, as follows: Klebsiella pneumoniae greater than E. coli greater than Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus faecium, Enterobacter aerogenes, Erwinia herbicola.
TI  - Uveitis, vitreous humour, and klebsiella. II. Cross-reactivity studies with radioimmunoassay.
AB  - Radioimmunoassay with calf and cow vitreous humour-I125 and rabbit antivitreous humour serum has been employed to investigate the immunological cross-reactivity of vitreous humour with bacterial and mammalian tissue antigens. Klebsiella ultrasonicate preparation at a dose fo 10 000 micrograms/ml was found to inhibit the binding of vitreous humour by 25-100% (p less than 0.001), compared with an inhibition of 5-30% by a similar quantity of E. coli ultrasonicate preparation. Equivalent amounts of Streptococcus pyogenes antigen, bovine haemoglobin, and hyaluronic acid had no inhibitory effect, while horse spleen ferritin was found to inhibit vitreous humour binding between 0 and 10%. These results indicate that klebsiella micro-organisms have antigens which partially resemble some eyeball components. It is suggested that acute anterior uveitis of ankylosing spondylitis may be produced by anti-Gram-negative bacterial antibodies binding to cross-reacting eye antigens.
TI  - Uveitis, vitreous humor, and klebsiella. I. Binding studies with rabbit antisera.
AB  - Uveitis occur in a proportion of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, and an increased faecal isolation of the Gram-negative micro-organism Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported from such patients. Immunological cross-reactivity between K. pneumoniae and bovine vitreous humour has been studied by 2 different antibody binding techniques: I125-labelled antigen binding assay with and without carrier, and beta-galactosidase enzyme-immunoassay. Sera from rabbits immunised with whole klebsiella micro-organisms or klebsiella extracts were found to bind labelled vitreous humour antigens to a greater extent (p less than 0.001) than sera from rabbits immunised with Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, and phi X 174 virus or sera from the same rabbits before immunisation. It is suggested klebsiella micro-organisms may carry antigenic determinants which resemble vitreous humour antigens.
TI  - [Basic and clinical examinations of 6059-S in pediatrics (author's transl)].
AB  - 1. MIC of 6059-S against 92 strains of clinically isolated bacteria were measured. The compound was active against most of Gram-negative rods, but was not active against Staphylococcus aureus. 2. 20 mg/kg of 6059-S (newly synthesized oxacephem antibiotics) was administered to the pediatric patients and its blood concentration was measured by agar well method using E. coli 7437 as a test organism. 3. The mean blood concentrations were maximum at 15 minutes after intravenous one-bolus injection. Maximum levels were 94.5 mcg/ml in the patients of below 5 years old and 98.7 mcg/ml above 6 years old. Their half-life of the blood levels were 95.4 and 110.6 minutes respectively. 4. The mean blood concentrations were highest at the end of the infusion in the cases of 60 minutes drip injection. Maximum levels were 85.0 mcg/ml in the patients of below 5 years old and 64.8 mcg/ml above 6 years old. 5. Clinical efficacy of 6059-S in 6 cases pyelonephritis, 2 cases of sepsis, 1 case of meningitis, 1 case of intraperitoneal abscess, 9 cases pneumonia and 2 case of tonsillitis was 100%. In the case of urinary tract infection, 4 patients were treated successfully by the administration of 20 mg/kg/day of 6059-S. Other bacterial infections were treated with 55 to 200 mg/kg/day. 6. 100% of the causative organisms were eliminated by 6059-S. They were E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, H. influenzae and beta-Streptococcus. 7. No remarkable side effect was noticed during administration.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefoxitin in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Studies on antimicrobial activity, absorption and excretion and clinical use of cefoxitin in pediatric field were performed. 1. MIC of cefoxitin was compared with that of cefazolin and/or ampicillin for clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (36 strains), Escherichia coli (35 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (34 strains) and Haemophilus influenzae (80 strains). MIC of cefoxitin against S. aureus was approximately 1-2 tubes higher than that of cefazolin. Many strains of E. coli and K. pneumoniae that showed high MIC to cefazolin were sensitive to cefoxitin. It is presumed that the results are due to the strong resistance of cefoxitin to beta-lactamase degradation. MIC of cefoxitin against H. influenzae was approximately 1-2 tubes lower than that of cefazolin, but approximately 4 tubes higher than that of ampicillin. 2. Serum level and urinary recovery rate of cefoxitin after one shot i.v. injection of 25 mg/kg were examined. The serum mean levels were 33.8 microgram/ml at 1/2 hour, 7.0 microgram/ml at 1 hour and 2.9 microgram/ml at 2 hours after the injection, respectively, and the drug was not detected in serum at 4 and 6 hours after the injection. The mean half-life of serum level was 27.1 minutes. The mean urinary recovery rate within 6 hours after injection was 96.0% and most of the drug were excreted into urine within 2 hours after the injection. 3. In order to evaluate clinical response, bacteriological response and side effects, cefoxitin was applied to 19 cases, i.e., 12 cases of either acute lobar pneumonia or acute bronchopneumonia, 2 cases of acute pyelitis, 1 case each of acute bronchitis, acute purulent tonsillitis, acute purulent arthritis, acute orbital phlegmon and acute buccal abscess. As for clinical response, the overall efficacy rate (the percentage of cases showed excellent and good efficacy) was 88.9%. As for bacteriological response, among the 13 strains which were determined or supposed to be causative organisms, i.e., 6 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 2 strains of H. influenzae and 1 strain each of streptococcus pyogenes, alpha-Streptococcus, Enterococcus, E. coli and Neisseria sp., all strains were disappeared except for Enterococcus which was reduced by the treatment with cefoxitin. No side effect was observed in any case. Abnormalities of laboratory findings were observed in 3 cases, i.e., 1 case each of reduction of RBC and Hb, elevation of GOT and GPT and elevation of GPT, but all of them returned to normal following completion of the dosage term.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefoxitin in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefoxitin (CFX) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Fifteen patients were treated with 73-125 mg/kg per day of CFX by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (4), pneumonia (2), pertussis and pneumonia (1), urinary tract infection (3); and the remaining 5 patients were esteemed to have nonbacterial infections. All the 10 patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CFX therapy. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Haemophilus influenzae (2), Escherichia coli (2), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (1). All the strains isolated were susceptible to CFX, but the 2 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae had relatively high MIC values (12.5 mcg/ml). Diarrhea (3 cases) and transient neutropenia (1 case) were found to be associated with the CFX therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half-life of the serum level was short (24.1 minutes) and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of 50 mg/kg of CFX in 1 case with inflamed meninges was considerably high (8.3 mcg/ml). CFX appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
TI  - [Quantitative bacterial ecology of normal nasal mucosa].
AB  - A quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%). Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. Among gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter, Providencia, Proteus, Citrobacter freundii, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia, Herella, Pseudomonas, and among the Hyphomycetes, Candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. Diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. Finally, interference phenomena in vivo by Staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus and Diphtheroids were noted.
TI  - Experimental infection of bovine mammary glands with Streptococcus agalactiae during the nonlactating period.
AB  - Two experiments were done to determine the rate of intramammary infection (IMI) in dairy cows during the nonlactating period. In experiment 1, all glands were equally exposed to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus agalactiae for the first 3 weeks after the start of the nonlactating period. Nearly all new IMI was caused by S agalactiae. In experiment 2, the susceptibility of nonlactating mammary glands to new IMI by S agalactiae after direct inoculation into the lactiferous sinus was determined. During the 1st month of the nonlactating period, 30% of inoculated glands became infected. During the last month of the nonlactating period, 90% of inoculated glands became infected.
TI  - Culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic.
AB  - To determine whether the culture of seminal fluid in a fertility clinic is of importance, bacterial cultures were obtained in a consecutive series of 96 patients. Routine bacteriologic cultures were performed within 1 hour of collection. Ureaplasma urealyticum (T-mycoplasma) cultures were also obtained in the last 31 of the patients in this series. Of these 96 patients, 11% showed significant bacterial growth (greater than 10(4) colonies/ml) in the semen specimens, 8% in those patients with normal semen analyses and 14% in those with abnormal analyses. Fifty-eight per cent of semen specimens were positive for U. urealyticum. In reference to normal and abnormal semen analyses the distribution was the same regardless of the presence or absence of U. urealyticum. Antibiotic treatment resulted in minor changes in motility and morphology in a few patients despite conversion to a negative culture. Cultures were also coordinated with microscopic urinalysis and the presence of white blood cells or bacteria in stained smears of semen. There were no significant differences between groups with positive or negative cultures. Trichomonas vaginalis was not seen.

TI  - Treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections with ceftriaxone (Ro 13-9904). A pilot study.
AB  - Two pilot comparative trials in 29 patients suffering from severe lower respiratory tract infections are described. 15 patients received 7-10.5 g ceftriaxone as a total dose and 14 received 28 g amoxicillin, both antibiotics being given by intravenous route during 1 week. The local and systemic tolerance of the drugs were satisfactory; no adverse reactions or relevant laboratory changes were noticed. The clinical response was favourable in all patients. The mot relevant pathogens found in the sputum were Streptococcus pneumoniae in 11 cases and Haemophilus influenzae in 15 cases. Less relevant microorganisms such as Klebsiella pneumonia, Serratia, Pseudomonas sp. and Streptococcus viridans were cultivated prior to therapy. The two main pathogens disappeared from the sputum after therapy in 11 of 13 patients treated with ceftriaxone and in 10 of 13 treated with amoxicillin. The results of these pilot studies indicate that 7-10.5 g ceftriaxone are as active as 28 g amoxicillin in the treatment of severe lower respiratory tract infections.

TI  - On the immunogenicity of ribosomes and ribosomal proteins isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - The two pathogenic species Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were used to analyze the immunogenic role of proteins in ribosomal preparations. The protective activity of ribosomes prepared from either strain and further purified by washing with high-salt concentrations, followed or not by sucrose gradient separation of the particles, was identical to that of crude unwashed ribosomes. Similarly, no substantial alteration of the level of protection was observed after treatment with the antibiotic puromycin. Therefore, the immunizing efficacy of ribosomes does not appear to be due either to the nonribosomal proteins adsorbed at the surface of organelles or to the growing polypeptide chain. It seems rather to be attributable to the structural ribosomal proteins themselves, which were indeed shown to induce alone a significant level of protection.
TI  - Microbial flora of the lower genital tract of women in labour in Zaria, Nigeria.
AB  - Nine genera of microbes isolated from the lower genital tract of 187 women in labour in Zaria have been identified. The work was undertaken to establish the nature of microorganisms in the lower genital tract of women in labour as a basis for further study. The isolates in order of prevalence were: Candida albicans (20.9%), Klebsiella sp (15.0%), Escherichia coli (9.1%), Streptococcus faecalis (6.4%), haemolytic streptococci (other than Streptococcus pyogenes (2.7%), Streptococcus viridans (2.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (2.1%), Aeromonas hydrophila (2.1%), Proteus mirabilis (1.1%), Peptostreptococcus putridus (1.1%), Streptococcus pyogenes (0.5%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.5%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp were sought but not found. Chlamydia, viruses, and T-strains of mycoplasma and trichomonas were not sought. It appears from this study that the lower genital tract of most women in Zaria at the time of labour is heavily colonised by pathogens. For this reason alone prolonged labour and trauma to the genital tract at the time of delivery should be avoided.
TI  - Cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin: in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities.
AB  - The activity of cefmenoxime (SCE-1365), 7 beta-[2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-(Z)-2-methoxyiminoacetamido]-3-[(1-methyl-1H-tetraz ol-5-yl)thiomethyl]ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid, was compared with that of other cephalosporins. Cefmenoxime exhibited high activity against a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The in vitro activity of cefmenoxime against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Enterobacteriaceae, including indole-positive Proteus, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, and Citrobacter freundii, was 10 to 1,000 times greater than that of several other cephalosporins. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cefmenoxime showed activity two to four times that of sulbenicillin and carbenicillin but less than that of cefsulodin. Variation in pH, addition of horse serum, and type of growth medium had definite effects on the activity of cefmenoxime, and the inoculum size affected the activity against bacterial species. In Escherichia coli cefmenoxime showed marked affinity for penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP-3), followed by PBP-1 (1A and 1B). This affinity profile was well correlated with its filamentous cell-forming activity under extremely low drug concentrations and with its bactericidal activity against microorganisms. The high in vitro activity of cefmenoxime was reflected in the degree of protection observed in mice infected intraperitoneally with a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, cefmenoxime showed good therapeutic activity against infection models in mice such as respiratory tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae and urinary tract infection caused by Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - BB-K 122: in vitro and in vivo activity against ocular pathogens.
AB  - BB-K 122 is a new aminoglycoside antibiotic and an analogue of amikacin. This study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo activity of BB-K 122 and gentamicin against important ocular pathogens. BB-K 122 and gentamicin demonstrated generally equivalent in vitro antibacterial activity, except that gentamicin was more active against Streptococcus sp. BB-K 122 showed significant in vitro activity against important ophthalmic pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and species of Klebsiella, Escherichia, Proteus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella. Solutions of BB-K 122 (1%) and gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) were compared in an experimentally induced rabbit keratoconjunctivitis model. Rabbit eyes infected with P. aeruginosa or S. pneumoniae were treated with one of the two antibiotic formulations and evaluated after 24 h. A topical formulation of 1% BB-K 122 was at least as effective as gentamicin sulfate (0.3%) solution against these infections.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis--a five year review 1975--1979.
AB  - In a five year period 142 cases of bacterial meningitis were reported, of which 50 per cent were children under the age of four years and a third of the children were neonates. The commonest organism isolated was Streptococcus pneumoniae, there being 28 cases. The incidence of Klebsiella organism causing meningitis has been on the increase, and 20 cases were reported within this period. There has been a change in pattern of neonatal meningitis, with group B streptococcal infection predominating over the gram negatives.
TI  - Postantibiotic suppression of bacterial growth.
AB  - Persistent suppression of bacterial growth following exposure of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria to numerous antimicrobial agents was studied. The persistent, or postantibiotic, effect was quantitated by periodic counts of colony-forming units after removal of the drug by washing, dilution, or inactivation with penicillinase. Although a postantibiotic effect was observed with all drugs studied, there were marked differences among drugs in their postantibiotic effects on certain organisms. With gram-positive organisms, concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics near the minimal inhibitory concentration produced persistent effects lasting 1-3 hr. With gram-negative organisms much higher concentrations were required to elicit a postantibiotic effect. Inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis produced the longest persistent suppression of growth, which was of comparable duration in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Only a short persistent effect of gentamicin was observed with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but a postantibiotic effect lasting 1.6-2.6 hr was observed with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The duration of the postantibiotic effect was related linearly to concentration of drug and duration of exposure up to a point of maximal response. Persistent effects following exposure to antibiotics were also demonstrated in 90% human serum.
TI  - Effect of CSF on bacterial growth.
AB  - The growth patterns of five potentially pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and a commonly encountered, nonpathogenic microorganism (S epidermidis) were compared using CSF, trypticase soy broth (TSB), and a phosphate buffer. Each grew less in CSF than in TSB. Escherichia coli was least affected with a median difference of 2 logarithms between CSF and TSB at 24 hours of growth, whereas S epidermidis was markedly inhibited, with a median difference of 6.85 logarithms. The differences among the remaining four organisms ranged from 3.86 to 5.94 logarithms, all significantly greater than that for E. coli. Similar results were obtained at 48 hours of growth. The non-support of bacterial growth by CSF may constitute a host defense mechanism. The basis of these observations may be the presence of inhibitors or the absence of nutrients required for bacterial growth in the CSF.
TI  - In vitro antagonism by erythromycin of the bactericidal action of antimicrobial agents against common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Ten strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were tested in vitro against erythromycin combined with ampicillin, cefamandole, or gentamicin. Antagonism by erythromycin occurred with 47% of the combinations involving strains of S. aureus and to a lesser degree with H. influenzae. Synergy occurred most commonly with H. influenzae (27%). The high frequency of antagonism and synergy with these organisms was associated with a broad range of bacteriostatic action by erythromycin against these same bacteria. The implications for the treatment of pneumonia are discussed.
TI  - Protective effects of S-sulfonated human gamma globulin against experimental infections in mice.
AB  - S-sulfonated gamma globulin (GGS), newly developed as a safe drug for intravenous use, was studied for its protective effects against some experimental infections in mice. Gamma globulin showed a good protective activity against infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and was moderately active against infections due to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In most cases, the potency of GGS was almost the same as that of original native gamma globulin. The duration of GGS activity in vivo was found to be comparable to that of native gamma globulin and much higher than that of pepsin-digested gamma globulin. In the control of infection due to E. coli, specific antibody was found to play a central role in the antibacterial action of GGS. When GGS was administered in combination with the antibiotics gentamicin and cefazolin for the control of infections due to S. pneumoniae or E. coli, a clear synergistic effect was observed.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of cefoperazone in children (author's transl)].
AB  - As a result of conducting experimental and clinical tests with the newly developed cephalosporin, cefoperazone (CPZ), the following conclusions were obtained: (1) When tested against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus and 16 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the antibacterial activity of CPZ was found to be weaker than that of CEZ. Against 5 strains of A-beta-Streptococcus and 4 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both CPZ and CEZ exhibited similar excellent antibacterial activity. CPZ was effective against 18 strains of Escherichia coli though its activity was influenced by the amount of inoculated bacteria present. Against 15 strains of Haemophilus influenzae and 10 strains of Haemophilus parahaemolyticus, CPZ was found to be more effective than CEZ though several high-resistant strains were noted. CPZ also showed more excellent antibacterial activity than CEZ against 4 strains of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 5 strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8 strains of Salmonella sp., 4 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 4 strains of Proteus sp. (2) The mean half-life in the blood following intravenous injections of 25 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of CPZ to three children was 70 minutes. (3) One hour after intravenous injection of 25 mg/kg of CPZ to 3 cases of aseptic meningitis, drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 1.20 mcg/ml, less than 0.39 mcg/ml and 1.55 mcg/ml. In one case, the CSF/serum ratio was 2.7%. (4) The average recovery rate in the urine of children who had received intravenous administrations of 25 mg/kg (3 children) and 10 mg/kg (1 child) was 17.8% between 0 and 6 hours. (5) Eighteen pediatric patients received CPZ in doses ranging from 48 to 170 mg/kg divided three-four times a day. They were RTI in 7, URI in 5, UTI in 5, SSSS in 1 and enteritis in 1 children. The clinical effectiveness of CPZ was judged to be remarkedly effective in 11 children, effective in 5 children and ineffective in 3 children, with an overall effective rate of 84.2%. One patient of tonsillitis combined sinusitis was considered 2 cases. The three cases in which the drug was found to e ineffective were 2 cases of pyothorax and 1 case of sinusitis. (6) Side effects were 1 case of eosinophilia, 2 cases of elevation of GOT and GPT, and 1 case of mild elevation of GOT. All were considered to be minor.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of miloxacin.
AB  - The chemotherapeutic properties of miloxacin (5,8-dihydro-5-methoxy-8-oxo-2H-1,3-dioxolo-[4,5-g]quinoline-7-carboxylic acid) have been compared with those of oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid. The in vitro activities of miloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentrations) against a variety of gram-negative bacteria, especially Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus, were comparable to those of oxolinic acid and 8 to 16 times greater than those of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was more active than oxolinic acid against some anaerobes and less active against staphylococci. Miloxacin exhibited significant activities when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, or Serratia marcescens. Its efficacy was comparable to that of oxolinic acid and two to four times greater than that of nalidixic acid. Miloxacin was less active against a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and inactive at the maximum test doses against a Streptococcus pyogenes infection.
TI  - Community-acquired bacteremia in the elderly: analysis of one hundred consecutive episodes.
AB  - A retrospective analysis was made of the records of 100 consecutive geriatric patients with community-acquired bacteremia, admitted to a suburban hospital. The most frequently identified tissue sources for these bacteremias were the urinary tract (34 percent), biliary tract (20 percent), and lungs (13 percent). In 11 percent of the patients, the tissue focus was not established. E. coli, Klebsiella species and Streptococcus pneumoniae were the most common organisms isolated, and they contributed to 73 percent of the bacteremias. Of the 100 patients, 26 succumbed to the infection. Clinical manifestations unique to the geriatric patient are described.
TI  - Microorganisms isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid in a general hospital. Clinical implications.
AB  - This study is a review of 1,040 significant positive blood cultures from 415 patients, and 44 positive cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 44 patients treated at the Meir General Hospital during the period 1976-78. The most frequent isolates from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most frequent isolates from cerebrospinal fluid cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis, which were present in similar proportions. E. coli was predominant in the division of medicine, Staph. aureus in the division of pediatrics and Klebsiella in the division of surgery. Fifty percent of the E. coli isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and carbenicillin; about 80%, to cephalothin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim; and 100%, to gentamicin. Only 7% of the Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to apicillin; 72% were sensitive to cephalothin and 87%, to gentamicin. Only 18% of Staph. aureus isolates were sensitive to penicillin, but about 95% were sensitive to methicillin or cephalothin. Two of 10 salmonellae isolates and 13% of H. influenzae were resistant to ampicillin.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 antigen.
AB  - An indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of the polysaccharide antigen of type 3 pneumococcus (SSS-III) is reported. Polystyrene balls with attached anti-SSS-III antibody serve as the solid phase, and antigen is detected using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antiglobulin conjugate. The reaction is quantitated by spectrophotometry. Concentrations of antigen are estimated by comparison with standard curves prepared with purified SSS-III. For this assay, the practical lower limit of detection of SSS-III is approximately 2 to 3 ng/ml, thus making the test sensitivity about 25 times that reported for counterimmunoelectrophoresis. In preliminary tests with simulated human clinical specimens, none of the body fluids tested (spinal fluid, serum, urine, and sputum) interfered with detection of antigen, nor did they produce false-positive or false-negative results. Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 whole organisms were readily detected in simulated clinically positive sputum specimens. Cross-reactions were not observed with Haemophilus influenzae type b, group B Streptococcus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Relation of antibody-coated urine bacteria to the site(s) of infection in experimental dogs.
AB  - Antibody-coated bacteria tests, using fluorescein-conjugated rabbit anti-canine immunoglobulin (Ig)G and anti-IgA, were conducted on 77 specimens of bladder urine obtained by antepubic cystocentesis from 25 dogs with urinary tract infections. Urine specimens from 3 dogs infected with Staphylococcus aureus were tested a total of 27 times, specimens from 10 dogs infected with Escherichia coli were tested 25 times, urine from 6 dogs infected with Proteus mirabilis was sampled and tested 18 times, urine from 3 dogs with Klebsiella pneumoniae was sampled and tested 4 times, and specimens from 3 dogs infected with P rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, or Streptococcus faecalis were tested once each. Specimens of urine from the renal pelves of each dogs were obtained by percutaneous nephropyelocentesis at the same time as the specimens of bladder urine. The results of bacterial cultures of these specimens were compared with the results of the corresponding antibody-coated bacteria tests. False-positive results (ie, evidence of antibody coating of bladder urine bacteria but no bacterial growth from corresponding renal pelvis urine specimens) were obtained in 13 of 22 (59%) tests of dogs infected with S aureus, 12 of 13 (92%) tests in dogs infected with P mirabiis, 5 of 18(28%) tests in dogs infected with E coli, and 1 of 4 (25%) tests in dogs infected with K pneumoniae. False-negative results (ie, bacterial growth from renal pelvis urine specimens but no evidence of antibody coating of bacteria in the corresponding specimen of bladder urine) occurred in 5 of 7 (71%) specimens infected with E coli, in 4 of 5 (80%) specimens infected with P mirabilis, and in 5 of 5 (100%) specimens infected with S aureus. It was concluded that the antibody-coated bacteria test does not provide accurate information to support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis in the dog.
TI  - Interaction between environmental pollutants and respiratory infections.
AB  - The major aspects that must be considered in studies of the health effects of environmental pollutants are: the direct damage due to the exposure, the role of pre-existing disease, and effects of the exposure on the response to secondary stresses. In experimental studies at concentrations of air pollutants found in urban environments frank toxicological responses are rarely observed. However, exposure to a secondary stress, i.e. respiratory challenge with infectious bacteria, can exacerbate the response of the experimental host. Changes in the resistance to respiratory infections provide a highly sensitive experimental animal model system, which is increasingly used in studies of health effects of air pollutants. This model indicates the impairment of the basic defense mechanisms of the respiratory system by the combined exposure to low concentrations of pollutants and the superimposed bacterial infection. Changes in the resistance to respiratory infections were studied in various species of laboratory animals. S. pyogenes and K. pneumoniae are the bacteria of choice to induce the pulmonary infection. Included in the studies are short-term single and multiple exposures as well as long-term exposures to gaseous pollutants such as O3 and NO2 and particulate pollutants such as sulfates and nitrates. Changes in the resistance are measured as excess mortalities and reduced survival time as compared to those in infected animals not exposed to the pollutants. Other parameters measured ranged from changes in the immune response to changes in retention rates of bacteria in lungs.

TI  - Abnormal colonization of neonates in an ICU: conversion to normal colonization by pharyngeal implantation of alpha hemolytic streptococcus strain 215.
AB  - Normal bacterial flora provide a natural defense mechanism against infection. Our experience indicates that "normal" flora for the ICU neonate contains alpha hemolytic (alpha-) streptococci as the predominant organism. The purpose of the current investigation is to study the feasibility of implanting a carefully selected, naturally occurring strain of alpha-streptococcus in the nasopharynx of neonates considered to be at high risk of infection because of the abnormal colonization of their pharynx with potential pathogens. Twenty-two infants in the neonatal intensive care unit have received nasopharyngeal implantation with strain 215 alpha-streptococcus. In 16 infants, alpha-streptococci, including the implant strain in pure or mixed alpha-streptococcal populations, constituted the predominant pharyngeal flora within 48 to 72 hr of implantation. The implant strain was not recovered from the remaining six infants. The procedure was apparently innocuous in this small number of patients. We conclude that implantation of a streptococcus can be established in the pharynx of infants abnormally colonized with pathogenic organisms in high titer and that successful implantation of strain 215 can result in prompt development of normal pharyngeal flora, with alpha-streptococci predominant, within 48 hr. There has been no evidence of infection or other adverse reaction caused by the implant strain.
TI  - Effect of contamination levels on antimicrobial susceptibilities tested by Autobac I.
AB  - Two gram-positive and five gram-negative species of bacteria commonly isolated from clinical specimens were used in 704 different inoculum ratios against 11 antimicrobial agents to study the effect of contamination levels on the susceptibility patterns of mixed cultures. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterobacter cloacae were used in 12 combinations of two each. The pure culture inoculum tubes were prepared according to Autobac I (Pfizer Inc.) instructions. Various amounts from 0.01 to 2.0 ml of one bacterial inoculum were mixed with various amounts of the other bacterial inoculum to form 16 mixtures to low-thymidine eugonic broth. In the majority of cases, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents started to change at 12.5% contamination level. Of 1,936 mixtures with 5% contamination levels, 98.5 to 99.2% exhibited the same susceptibilities as did the pure cultures. These results suggest that generally contamination levels of more than 5% or 70,000 to 150,000 bacteria per ml, are responsible for a significant change in apparent drug susceptibility.
TI  - Biphasic protection against bacterial infection in mice induced by vaccination of Propionibacterium acnes.
AB  - A single intraperitoneal injection of the phenol-treated cells of Propionibacterium acnes into mice showed nonspecific resistance against subsequent lethal doses of an intraperitoneal challenge of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The protection showed a biphasic pattern. The maximum protection, designated as the early phase protection, was seen in mice injected with P. acnes vaccine 1 to 2 days before the challenge, whereas the late phase protection was seen in mice vaccinated 16 to 22 days before the challenge. The activity of the reticuloendothelial system in mice after vaccination also showed a biphasic pattern with the peak on days 4 and 12. The delayed activation of the reticuloendothelial system lasted up to 3 weeks and coincided with the period of the late phase protection. The early phase resistance was markedly impaired by the treatment with hydrocortisone and carrageenan, but not by the treatment with anti-thymocyte serum, actinomycin D, or cyclophosphamide. The number of peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vaccinated mice increased on days 1 to 2. The number of macrophages also increased at 2 to 21 days after vaccination and reached its maximum on day 14. Total activities of acid phosphatase, Nitro Blue Tetrazolium reduction, and the phagocytic activities of peritoneal exudate cells were also enhanced on and after day 1 after the injection of P. acnes vaccine.
TI  - Outbreak of amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in an intensive care nursery.
AB  - An outbreak of amikacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (KES) occurred in the Intensive Care Nursery (ICN) of the Louisville General Hospital from January 1978 through March 1978. Epidemic disease and an increased colonization rate in newborn infants due to amikacin-resistant microorganisms has not been documented previously. Three of the 11 neonates died. The organisms isolated were resistant to amikacin and two experimental aminoglycosides, sissomicin and netilmicin. The outbreak was contained following institution of several control measures, including pharyngeal inoculation of an experimental strain of alpha streptococcus in four infants.
TI  - [Inactivation of viruses and bacteria in sewage sludge by gamma radiation (author's transl)].
AB  - The kinetics of inactivation and the resistance to gamma radiation of microorganisms usually to be found in raw sludge were examined with five viruses, three bacteria and a fungus serving as prototypes in comparative studies. All these infectious agents could reliably be inactivated by gamma rays in raw sewage sludge but they were clearly more resistant to gamma rays compared to irradiation in a liquid suspension. The reduction of the virus content required a much higher radiation dose compared to bacteria and the fungus used, excluding Streptococcus faecalis which was exceptionally resistant. Considering the content of pathogenic viruses and other agents in raw sewage sludge, the required radiation dose necessary to comply with average to strict demands for the hygienisation of sewage sludge is discussed. The radiation dose of 500 to 1,000 krad seems therefore to be sufficient.
TI  - Comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam LY127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - A total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and Serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. These strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. Their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, LY127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (HR 756), and cefoperazone (T 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the same hospital in 1979. Susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. Strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins and other effective antibiotics. The agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. The multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. Both Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935 and cefotaxime. P. aeruginosa (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. All three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., and Citrobacter spp. Providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam LY127935. The three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. Streptococcus pyogenes and S. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to LY127935. None of the three new beta-lactams was active against S. faecalis. All were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - The role of Klebsiella in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis. II Evidence for a specific B27-associated marker on the lymphocytes of patients with ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Although the strong association of HLA-B27 with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is well documented, the significance of this association is largely unknown. It has recently been reported that Klebsiella pneumoniae was present in the faeces of patients with AS more frequently than in healthy individuals, and that there appeared to be some cross-reactivity between HLA-B27 and Klebsiella. We have therefore attempted to gain an insight into the possible role of Klebsiella in the pathogenesis of AS. The results presented here indicate that HLA-B27 positive individuals with AS have a significantly lower in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness to Klebsiella antigens, as compared with B27 positive and B27 negative healthy controls. By contrast, B27 positive patients with AS as well as B27 positive and negative controls respond equally well to phytohaemagglutinin, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Yersinia and Shigella. To investigate a possible cross-reactivity between Klebsiella and HLA-B27, antisera were raised in rabbits against various isolates of Klebsiella. An antiserum to one isolate (427) of Klebsiella lysed the lymphocytes of B27 positive AS patients but not of B27 positive or B27 negative controls. These observations strongly suggest that some Klebsiella antigens cross-react with a gene product closely associated with HLA-B27 or possibly with a modified B27 antigen in patients with AS.
TI  - Pharmacokinetics and clinical experiences of the combination sulfadiazine-trimethoprim in the short-term treatment of acute urinary tract infections.
AB  - The pharmacokinetics of sulfadiazine (SD) combined in a small dose (250 mg) with  trimethoprim (TMP, 160 mg) and given twice daily were studied in eight healthy subjects. Both drugs were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and their concentrations in serum as well as in urine could be considered high enough for the treatment of acute urinary tract infections (UTI). In none of the subjects did the concentration of SD in urine exceed the experimental limit established for crystallization of the drug. Serum half-lives of SD and TMP were 10.8 and 11.8 hrs, respectively. In microbiological assay synergistic interaction was found in human urine with both the combination of SD + TMP and SM (sulfamethoxazole) + TMP on all the tested strains of E. coli, Str. faecalis, Str. agalactiae, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. A double-blind clinical trial was carried out with patients having acute UTI, using either the combination SD + TMP (250 mg + 160 mg) or the combination SM + TMP (800 mg + 160 mg) twice daily for one week. The results of the treatment were equally successful in both groups. Treatment failed in only 4 out of 85 cases, although in 12 cases the causative micro-organism was resistant in vitro to the combination of SM + TMP.
TI  - Study of the teratogenic activity of ribosomal vaccine.
AB  - The investigation on the possible teratogenic activity of a vaccinal formula of ribosomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes A12 and Haemophilus influenzae (D 53) was carried out in three animal species: rats, mice, rabbits. The trials were performed on two generatins of rats and mice, and on one single generation of rabbits. D 53 was given in s.c. injections (6 days a week) for 8 days before mating the females, and then until the females dropped (or were sacrificed when foetuses had to be removed by Caesarean operation). The possible teratogenic or embryotoxic effects of D 53 were evaluated using the following checks: fertility rates in the mated females; rates of placenta-foetal resorptions; abnormalites in foetuses and offspring (dissection and skeletal staining). In the above experimental conditions, D 53 had no embryotoxic and teratogenic activity in the 3 animal species used.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of co-trimoxazole and tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine in vitro (author's transl)].
AB  - The antibacterial activity of the newly developed combination, tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine, was evaluated and compared with that of the combination, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Tested strains were: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus faecalis. The components in both combinations were assayed in different ratios on a weight basis and activities measured as minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations employing serial dilution tests in Isosensitest bouillon in microtiter plates. It was found that the combination tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine acts synergistically -- as does the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole -- optimal antibacterial activities being achieved with a weight ratio benzylpyrimidine/sulfonamide of 1:1 or 1:5, respectively. In all instances, the combination trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole proved to be of higher antibacterial in vitro activity than that of tetroxoprim/sulfadiazine.
TI  - Immunoglobulin production in man stimulated by an orally administered bacterial lysate.
AB  - The concentrations of secretory immunoglobulins in the saliva, and of immunoglobulin in the serum, have been measured by the radial immunodiffusion method in 12 healthy volunteers, before and after oral administration of Broncho-Vaxom which is a lysate of bacteria that usually cause infection in the upper respiratory tract. The mean concentration of secretory IgA in the saliva was increased by over 100% after the 10-day administration of the product. This increase was statistically significant between the 20th and 33rd day after the beginning of the treatment (p < 0.05). It fell to a normal level after a month in 4 subjects who received one treatment course only. In 8 subjects who received a second treatment course beginning 1 month after termination of the first course, the high concentration of IgAs in the saliva persisted for at least 3 months. A significant increase in the serum concentrations of IgG of about 50% and of IgM of at least 100% above the initial level was observed in the treated subjects in the time between day 35 and 5 months after the beginning of the experiment (p < 0.05).

TI  - Mastitis: II. Evaluation of antimicrobial amines for use as teat dips.
AB  - Recent proposals by the Food and Drug Administration to regulate teat dips as drugs have led to a search for safer teat dip ingredients. Primary, secondary, and tertiary alkyl amines (carbon-10 to -18 chain length) inhibit growth of mastitic bacteria (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichi coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) in a broth tube culture assay. Since carbon-13 compounds were active, a carbon-13 primary (tridecanamine hydrochloride), secondary methyl (N-methyltridecanamine), secondary ethyl (N-ethyltridecanamine), tertiary dimethyl amine (N, N-dimethyltridecanamine), and carbon-12 quaternary amine (N, N, -trimethyldodecaneammonium chloride) were tested for their ability to reduce experimentally applied populations of S. agalactiae or E. coli on the bovine teat surface. The five compounds were compared at concentrations of 100, 500, 1,000, 3,000, 7,000, and 10,000 ppm. Activity was greater against the gram-positive S. agalactiae than against the gram-negative E. coli. The tertiary amine was most active, producing a log reduction of 4 (reduction of bacterial number from 10(6) to 10(2)) at a concentration of 3,000 ppm in the teat dip. The relative order of effectiveness for the amines was: dimethyl tertiary greater than methyl secondary greater than ethyl secondary greater than primary = quaternary. The results suggest that these amines may be useful as potent, effective antibacterial agents for incorporation into teat dips.

TI  - [Clinical differentiation between idiopathic respiratory distress, neonatal septicemia caused by group B streptococci and septicemia caused by other pathogens (author's transl)].
AB  - Since bacterial infection in newborns must be treated as specifically and as early as possible, it is important to confirm a diagnosis of suspected infection based on clinical symptoms and to take possible pathogens into consideration when choosing therapy. RDS and septicemia with Group B streptococci can present very similar clinical symptoms, but leucopenia on the first day of life is most probably an indication of septicemia with Group B streptococci. Septicemia caused by other pathogens, however, usually has a much later onset. In the days following birth a raised cardiothoracic index indicates RDS. Other differential criteria are being investigated.
TI  - Ribosomal vaccines: immunological study.
AB  - Ribosomal vaccines prepared from purified bacterial ribosomes induce the production of specific antibodies in female OF1 mice when administered to the animals both with incomplete Freund's adjuvant or purified Klebsiella pneumoniae cell wall proteoglycans. The study of these fractions concerned purified ribosomes extracted from the following bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilius influenzae, Steptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes A12. Specific antibodies determination by immunoelectro diffusion (IED) and passive hemagglutination (PHA) were used to study the immune response.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis by use of frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatography: analysis of amines.
AB  - The major causative agents of bacterial meningitis (Haemophilus influenzae serogroup B, Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Steptococcus pneumoniae, and two types of Escherichia coli) were cultured in a chemically defined medium, and selected strains were further studied in Todd-Hewitt medium. After acidic extraction of the spent media with chloroform, a basic extraction was made with chloroform to obtain amines. A third extraction was performed on re-acidified Todd-Hewitt medium with ethyl ether to obtain hydroxyacids. The extracts were derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride-ethanol to form electron-capturing derivatives, and the derivatives were analyzed on a frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatograph (FPEC-GLC) equipped with a PEP-2 computer. The data obtained from the study showed that amines were produced by these organisms that formed characteristic patterns. Different serotypes of K. pneumoniae and the two serogroups of N. meningitidis produced different types of FPEC-GLC profiles within serotypes. E. coli produced several hydroxy acids on Todd-Hewitt medium that made it unique among the organisms studied. The methods used are practical and the techniques have potential for use in clinical laboratories and hospitals as a valuable aid for the rapid identification of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Rapid differentiation of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis by use of frequency-pulsed electron capture gas-liquid chromatograph: analysis of acids.
AB  - The major causative agents of bacterial meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae serogroup B, Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and two types of Escherichia coli, were cultured in a modified chemically defined Catlin medium and in a commercial version of the unmodified Catlin medium. The spent media were extracted under acidic conditions, and electron-capturing derivatives were prepared by derivatization with trichloroethanol or haptafluorobutyric anhydride. The derivatives were analyzed on a gas chromatograph equipped with a frequency-pulsed electron capture detector and a PEP-2 computer. The data obtained from the study show that these organisms can be easily distinguished from each other on the basis of metabolic products detected in either type of medium. Three different metabolic groups were detected within two serogroups of N. meningitidis. The methods are practical, and the new technique should offer clinical laboratories and hospitals a better method for rapid identification of this important group of pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of moxalactam, a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of moxalactam was studied in vitro against 229 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic microorganisms using the agar dilution technique. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as growth medium. The results were compared to those obtained with cefamandole. All isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by moxalactam at a concentration of 8 microgram/ml or less. The concentrations of cefamandole with which the same effect was obtained were 0.5 microgram/ml and 2 microgram/ml respectively. Moxalactam was highly inhibitory against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus morganii - 90% of the strains were inhibited by 0.125 microgram/ml. Moxalactam was highly superior against Proteus rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are usually resistant to cefamandole: the MIC100 and MIC90 were 0.25 microgram/ml and 8 microgram/ml respectively. High sensitivity was found in strains of Salmonella species, nine of which were Salmonella typhi: the MIC90 was < 0.063 microgram/ml versus the eightfold higher concentration of cefamandole. The broad-spectrum activity and unusual MIC patterns of moxalactam - eight or manyfold higher concentrations of cefamandole were needed to inhibit 90% of most gram-negative strains studied - make moxalactam an unusual and promising antibiotic.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.

TI  - Ribosomal vaccines: preparation of subcellular fractions.
AB  - Methods for isolation and analysis of subcellular bacterial fractions intended to be used in the preparation of ribosomal vaccines are described. Cultivation conditions in fermentors for obtaining maximal growth curve slopes are studied; cultivation is stopped before the end of the exponential growth phase in order to collect biomasses having a high viability rate, which is essential for the quality of the subcellular fractions isolated thereafter. Extraction methods for ribosomes and ribosomal RNA, as well as two proceedings for preparing adjuvant proteoglycans from Klebsiella pneumoniae membranes, are described. The analytical methods used for the control of these preparations and the results obtained for the various fractions are given.
TI  - Attachment of bacteria to mammalian surfaces.
AB  - Much attention has been devoted to the study of bacterial adherence to mammalian  surfaces in vitro during the past several years. Some in vivo evidence also suggests that this process may indeed be an integral part of the pathogenesis of colonization and certain infections. The biochemical basis of attachment and definition of the actual receptor sites involved are just starting to become known and seem to be different amongst individual bacteria genera. However, pili may mediate attachment of a variety of gram-negative organisms to receptor cells, and streptococcal lipoteichoic acids probably serve a similar function. Some recent study methods and results in this field are reviewed.
TI  - Bacteriologic considerations in perforated necrotizing enterocolitis.
AB  - During a ten-year period, 61 infants with perforated necrotizing enterocolitis were managed by bowel resection, enterostomy, and intravenous antibiotics. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken of venous blood, from the peritoneal cavity at operation, and of any subsequent wound and/or intraperitoneal infection. No significant differences between fatal and nonfatal cases were noted with respect to presence of anaerobes in the peritoneal flora (six babies with two deaths) or culture-confirmed bacteremia (73% of the total). However, peritonitis participated in by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ten babies), or beta-hemolytic streptococcus (five babies) was -niformly lethal, as were complicating bacteremias due to P aeruginosa, beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and Staphylococcus aureus (two each). Anaerobic peritoneal isolates (all gram-positive cocci) were never noted if performation occurred before the eighth day of life; they did not appear to adversely affect survival. Based upon these data, antibiotic therapy should include either gentamicin or tobramycin, with penicillin, until subsequent culture reports dictate otherwise.
TI  - Polymicrobial bacteremia.
AB  - Of 26,961 blood cultures taken during an 18-month period at the Cincinnati General Hospital, 1,715 (6%) were positive. Ninety-four patients had blood cultures containing more than one organism. Although aerobic and anaerobic streptococci were the most frequently isolated bacteria, a variety of microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, was isolated in different combinations depending on the underlying disease. Neurological illness, malignant neoplasms, burns, and decubitus ulcers were among the most common underlying conditions found. The overall mortality was 54%, but only 58% of these deaths were specifically related to an episode of polymicrobial bacteremia. Patient survival was significantly related to appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Intravenous trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the treatment of serious infections  in children.
AB  - Intravenous TMP-SMZ was used to treat 19 infectious episodes in 18 patients ranging in age from 3 weeks to 13 years. Thirteen patients with various soft tissue or skeletal infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes, or Acinetobacter anitratus were successfully treated. Three children with four episodes of CSF shunt infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci were treated successfully also. The only treatment failures were in two newborn infants with enteric gram-negative bacterial ventriculitis. TMP-SMZ was given at a daily dose of 10 and 50 mg/kg, respectively, every six hours. The drug was administered intravenously for a mean duration of 10 days (range 4 to 32); in 11 patients this was followed by oral administration for a mean of nine days (range 2 to 18). Half-life of TMP after intravenous administration was 5 1/4 hours; that of SMA was 8 1/2 hours. Levels determined three to four days after starting therapy were generally higher than levels obtained at corresponding times after the first dose. CSF/blood TMP and SMA ratios, determined in four patients, were 0.6 and 0.5, respectively. Side effects were observed in 14 patients, and neutropenia was the most common adverse reaction. Intravenous TMP-SMZ is an effective antimicrobic agent in the treatment of infections due to susceptible organisms. The frequent side effects, although reversible and of no major clinical consequence, suggest that future use of TMP-SMZ should be monitored closely.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo laboratory studies on three hydroxyiminophenylacetyl cephalosporins with particular reference to SK&F 80303, an unusually long-acting cephalosporin.
AB  - Three cephalosporins with 7-(2-hydroxyiminophenylacetamido) side chains (SK&F 79433, 80000 and 80303), differing in their 3-substituents, exhibited similar broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and various Gram-negative bacilli. All three were active in vivo (s.c., mouse) against S. aureus, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae, but they differed significantly in serum pharmacokinetic profiles. SK&F 80303 produced high and extremely prolonged serum levels and protected mice when administered up to 24 hours prior to challenge with beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus or K. pneumoniae. It was resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases from S. aureus, and variably so to beta-lactamases from E. coli strains. SK&F 80303 was bacteriolytic to logarithmically growing S. aureus, E. coli, Proteus mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae (partially). SK&F 80303 illustrates further the effect of the 3-sulfoalkyltetrazole substituent on the pharmacokinetic properties of cephalosporins. Its combined biological properties make it a possible candidate for therapeutic and long-term prophylactic use.
TI  - Role of interferon in mice in protection against influenza A virus by bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins of Klebsiella pneumoniae as adjuvant.
AB  - Nonspecific protection against infectious aerosols of influenza A virus was obtained in Swiss mice after vaccination by aerosols of bacterial ribosomes together with membranal glycoproteins extracted from Klebsiella pneumoniae as the adjuvant. It was shown that repeated stimulant aerosols were necessary to obtain this protection. Routine estimation of serum interferon levels after administration of the association of ribosomes plus membranal glycoproteins to the animals by aerosol or intravenous route showed that there was no correlation between protection and the presence of serum interferon. It was shown that the serum interferon-inducer activity was due to ribosomes. No induction of serum interferon was obtained with membranal glycoproteins used separately. Local liberation of interferon in the mucous membrane of the upper respiratory tract was not investigated.
TI  - [A clinical observation of cefuroxime in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefuroxime, a new synthetic cephalosporin, was administered to 10 pediatric patients (6 with respiratory tract infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with sepsis of E. coli and 1 with enterocolitis). The clinical result was good and excellent in all the 10 cases. No side effect was observed in any of them.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY 127935 (6059-S), seven cephalosporins, three  aminoglycosides, carbenicillin, and ticarcillin.
AB  - LY 127935 (6059-S), a new semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic was tested simultaneously with 6 cephalosporins, 3 aminoglycosides, carbenicillin and ticarcillin against 398 clinical isolates of Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive cocci. Many of the organisms were selected for study because of known resistance to one or more of the clinically available antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Serratia and Providencia were susceptible to LY 127935. Some resistant strains of Enterobacter, Proteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter were also resistant to LY 127935, but many of the strains resistant to other antibiotics were susceptible to LY 127935. The activity of LY 127935 against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans and Streptococcus bovis was similar to that of cephalexin and cephradine. LY 127935 was not active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus nor enterococcus.
TI  - Indirect sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rapid detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection.
AB  - We report the development and testing of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with excellent sensitivity for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae type b (HI(b)) antigen in clinical specimens from patients with HI(b) meningitis. The assay, an indirect sandwich technique, uses polystyrene balls as a solid phase and an alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulin conjugate. Specimens are incubated with polystyrene balls armed with burro anti-HI(b) antiserum, and recognition antibody is visualized by addition of alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-globulin, together with the enzyme substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Concentrations of antigen are determined from standard curves prepared by using purified HI(b) capsular antigen polyribophosphate. The assay reproducibly detects polyribophosphate at concentrations between 1 and 5 ng/ml. Cross-reactions have not as yet been encountered in simulated and authentic clinical specimens containing other species including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, group B Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. In preliminary tests with 11 spinal fluid specimens, 2 serum specimens, and 5 urine specimens from patients with culture-proved HI(b) meningitis, antigen was detected in all specimens in concentrations ranging from 1 to 7,000 ng/ml. Antigen was not detected in any of 62 clinical specimens which were culture negative for HI(b), including 11 spinal fluid specimens from patients with bacterial meningitis caused by microorganisms other than HI(b). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique described here is considerably simpler than radioimmunoassay and, based on concurrent tests with 14 positive clinical specimens, may be more sensitive than counterimmunoelectrophoresis. It seems, therefore, to hold considerable promise for clinical use in rapid detection of systemic HI(b) infections.
TI  - Defective activation of the third component of complement in the sera of newborn  infants.
AB  - The activation of the terminal complement components, C3--9, plays an important role in the host's defense against infection. In the present study, the ability of bacteria to activate the third component of complement (C3) in newborn serum was examined. A variety of bacteria were incubated in test sera at 37 degrees C for 30 min and the percent of available C3 that was activated was measured. Using one strain of Escherchia coli (no. 3), 32% (mean) of the available C3 was activated in sera from 18 newborns, as compared to 85% in sera from their mothers and 79% in sera from 13 normal adults (P less than 0.005). In contrast, using another strain of E. coli (N70), the percent of C3 activated in newborn sera (83%) was the same as in sera from their mothers (81%) or in sera from normal adults (73%). The defective activation of C3 in newborn sera by E. coli was not related to the presence of the K1 antigen. Newborn sera were also challenged with other bacterial species and the activation of C3 was deficient when tested with klebsiellae, but not with staphylococci or streptococci. The defect in newborn sera appeared to be due to a deficiency of a serum factor rather than to the presence of an inhibitor.
TI  - 3-[(1,2,3-Thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins.
AB  - The syntheses of ten 3-](1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl]cephalosporins, made by displacement of the 3'-acetoxy group by the novel thiol derivatives, potassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-thiolate and dipotassium 1,2,3-thiadiazole-4-carboxylate-5-thiolate, are described. Several of the compounds showed good in vitro antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. The subcutaneous in vivo activities against Staphylococcus aureus were generally less than that of cafazolin. Four of the compounds were administered orally and all were active; the 7 beta-(thiophen-2-acetamido) and 7 beta-(D-2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-3-[(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-ylthio)methyl] compounds were equally active by either route, with a PD50 of ca. 1 mg/kg.
TI  - Neonatal lung abscess. A report of six cases.
AB  - Six infants 8 weeks of age or younger had lung abscesses treated in our medical center during the 20-year period of from 1957 to 1977. The duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis, the etiologic organisms, and the therapeutic approach differ from those in older children and adults. The pathogenic organisms were Escherichia coli, group B streptococcus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, initial therapy with a penicillin and an aminoglycoside are indicated until identification and susceptibility results are available on the organism isolated from the abscess cavity. Previously undiagnosed cystic malformations of the lung were seen in two of the six patients. Surgical intervention is usually required in this age group.
TI  - The role of bacterial interference in the increased prevalence of oropharyngeal gram-negative bacilli among alcoholics and diabetics.
AB  - The oral flora of alcoholics, diabetics, and normal control subjects were compared using an agar overlay technique to determine whether the increased prevalence of oropharyngeal gram-negative bacilli among alcoholics and diabetics exists because patients with these diseases have decreased numbers of normal inhibitory bacteria in the oropharynx. Alcoholics generally had slightly lower concentrations of inhibitory bacteria than control subjects, and diabetics had somewhat higher concentrations than control subjects. However, colonized subjects did not differ from noncolonized subjects with respect to concentrations of these inhibitory bacteria in the oropharynx. Characterization of inhibitory bacteria demonstrated a preponderance of nongroupable alpha-hemolytic streptococci in each of the study groups. Stimulated saliva obtained from subjects failed to demonstrate significant differences in pH between study populations or between colonized and noncolonized subjects within each study population. These results suggest that the frequent oropharyngeal colonization of alcoholics and diabetics by gram-negative bacilli involves mechanisms other than that of a deficiency of normal interfering aerobic bacteria in the oropharynx or an altered salivary pH leading to inactivation in vivo of bacteriocins produced by these inhibitory bacteria.
TI  - Detection of experimental bacteremia and fungemia by examination of buffy coat prepared by a micromethod.
AB  - Rabbits received intravenous injections of bacteria or fungi, and a comparison was made of the abilities of broth cultures, plating after dilution either in saline solution or in distilled water containing Triton X-100, and buffy coat examinations to detect the organisms in heart blood. The most sensitive method was broth culture. By microscopy or subculture of buffy coat cells prepared by centrifugation of blood in microhematocrit tubes, organisms were rapidly and regularly detected when their viable counts increased to 300--1,000/ml as detected by plating. By micromodification, buffy coat examination is technically easy to perform, and the method is only slightly less sensitive than when a larger amount of blood is used. Thus, it would be ideal for rapid provisional diagnosis of sepsis in patients, e.g., neonates, when the use of only a small blood sample is preferred.
TI  - Intradermal responses to common bacterial antigens: influences of sex and clinical condition.
AB  - Intradermal responses to antigens of 12 common bacteria were evaluated in 218 dermatologic and 155 respiratory patients. Women responded more frequently than men and respiratory patients responded significantly more frequently than dermatologic patients to certain antigens. Interpretation of interspecies associations of responses suggested that certain organisms may be key species in the development of bacterial hypersensitivity.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of cefadroxil, cephalexin, and cephradine in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  - Cefadroxil (Duricef, Mead Johnson and Company), resembles cephalexin and cephradine in spectrum of antibacterial activity but differs in human pharmacokinetic properties. Whether the latter are likely to affect activity in vivo was assessed by determining bactericidal activity against clinical isolates under conditions simulating the variation of drug concentration in the blood stream after an oral dose of 500 mg to adults. In this kinetic model, cefadroxil was more active than cephalexin or cephradine against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae and one of two strains of Escherichia coli. The other strain of E. coli was virtually unaffected by the cephalosporins. S. pyogenes was equally susceptible to all three cephalosporins. Analysis of the results suggest that the pharmocokinetic properties of an antibiotic affect its activity in the blood stream, provided the susceptibility of the infecting organism is concentration-dependent within the range of drug concentration occurring in serum.
TI  - [Bacterial infections in renal homotransplant recipients. Results of regular bacteriological controls (author's transl)].
AB  - Bacterial infections were studied in 51 immunosuppression kidney transplant recipients. Eighty infectious episodes occured in the first six post-transplantation months. Forty percent of these episodes were nonfebrile, detected during the routine bacteriological follow-up examination. Out of these 80 bacterial infections, 59 were localized (47 in the urinary tract, nine in the surgical wound and three in the lungs) and 21 had spread. Neutopenia occured in 13 patients, in association with septicaemia in eight of them. Usually septicaemia appeared before neutropenia. In 12 cases, infectious episodes (10 septicaemias and two localized infections) and transplant failure were closely related. The bacterial strains responsible for these infections were essentially: Staphylococcus spp (39), Streptococcus spp (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9), Escherichia coli (9). Most of the localized infections cleared up when treated with a specific antibiotic. Seven failures of antibiotic treatment were observed in 21 cases of generalized infections. The importance of regular post-transplantation bacteriological check-up in detecting and treating infectious complications in graft recipients must be emphasized.
TI  - [Sensitivity of frequent-occurring isolates in outpatients to routinely-used antibiotics (author's transl)].
AB  - The susceptibility of microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Haemophilus influenzae) frequently occurring in outpatients (treated by practitioners) to six kinds of antibiotics [ampicillin (ABPC), cefazolin (CEZ), erythromycin (EM), minocycline (MNC), gentamicin (GM) and thiamphenicol (TP)] was determined by the standard method established by the Japan Society of Chemotherapy. 1) There were few multiple-antibiotic-resistant urine isolates from patients with a simple urinary tract infection, whereas urine isolates from patients with a complicated urinary tract infection contained many multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 2) Isolates from patients with a respiratory tract infection (sputum and tonsillar secretions isolates) and isolates from patients with acute purulent otitis media (purulent discharge isolates) contained few multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms except for EM-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes. 3) Superficial pus isolates contained many multiple-antibiotic-resistant organisms, while bile isolates were relatively free from multiple-antibiotic resistant organisms. 4) When the results of the previous8,9) and present investigations were compared with the reports of other Japanese investigators1,5,6), suggestive evidence was provided that organisms resistant to macrolides and chloramphenicol showed a tendency to decrease, whereas organisms resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycoside antibiotics were on the increase.

TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  - Semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group A) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group B). These 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. Overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group A were positive and 73% from group B were positive. Mixed bacterial flora were isolated from both groups but in group B they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group A. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staph. aureus, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma hominis, and Ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group A. Group B revealed these organisma plus Streptococcus pneumoniae type III, Strep. pyogenes group A, Strep. feacalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Bacteroides species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Eubacterium species. Semen samples from group A were of better quality than those from group B. In addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group A was greater than that from group B.
TI  - Septicemia in association with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
AB  - Fifty consecutive episodes of septicemia were studied in 41 children who had acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Seventy-six percent of these episodes occurred when the absolute granulocyte count was 200/mm3 or less and were caused by gram-negative enteric and gram-positive mucocutaneous bacteria. In eight patients, Streptococcus pyogenes was isolated at the time when ALL was diagnosed. Multiple anaerobic and aerobic isolates from a single blood culture were associated with abdominal distress, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus influenzae septicemia occurred in associated with respiratory illnesses. When patients with severe compromise of anatomic barriers or respiratory disease were excluded, 94% of all patients with septicemia had an AGC of less than 200/mm3. The data provide guidelines for treatment for febrile patients with ALL based upon the AGC, the phase of the disease, and on the presence of associated respiratory or abdominal findings.
TI  - Trimethoprim in combination with a sulfonamide for oral treatment of canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - Trimethoprim, in combination with sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole was administered orally for 7 to 14 days to 84 dogs with urinary tract infections (UTI). The daily dosage of 26.4 mg/kg (12 mg/lb) was divided into 2 equal parts and administered at about 12-hour intervals. Response to treatment, based on negative urine culture during or after therapy, was 37 of 45 (82%) for UTI caused by Escherichia coli, 11 of 15 (73%) UTI caused by Proteus mirabilis, 8 of 12 (67%) UTI caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 of 6 (100%) UTI caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and 5 of 9 (56%) UTI caused by Streptococcus spp. These 5 species comprised 88% of the bacteria isolated from the dogs in this study.
TI  - Minimal antibiotic concentrations of aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics  for some gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The minimal antibiotic concentration (MAC) is the lowest concentration of an antibacterial agent that produces a decrease of 1 log in the number of organisms/ml as compared with a control culture in drug-free medium. Various gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci were grown in the presence of amikacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, oxacillin, carbenicillin, ticarcillin, and cefamandole at concentrations varying from eight times the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to 1/128 of the MIC. Colony forming units (cfu) were counted, the MIC was determined, and the MIC:MAC ratio, which indicates the magnitude of the effective range, was calculated. The MIC:MAC ratio appears to be characteristic for a given species and antibiotic. There is no relation between the MICs and the MIC:MAC ratios. The highest ratios were given by Proteus mirabilis with aminoglycosides (MIC:MAC mean, 29.2 with tobramycin), and the lowest ratios were given with beta-lactam antibiotics by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus faecalis (MIC:MAC means, 2.1 with carbenicillin and cefamandole, respectively).

TI  - Mastitis: I. In vitro antimicrobial activity of alkyl amines against mastitic bacteria.
AB  - The activities of branched and straight chain amines (10 to 18 carbons chain length) were compared in inhibiting the growth of five microorganisms that cause about 95% of bovine mastitis. Three gram-positive (Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus) and two gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) bacteria were used in a trypticase soy broth tube culture growth assay. Sixty-two compounds were screened at concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 ppm in broth culture to determine the effective minimum inhibitory concentration. Alkyl secondary N-substituted monoethyl [CH3(CH2)nNHCH2CH3] and tertiary N,N-substituted dimethyl [CH3(CH2) nN(CH3)2] amines with chain lengths of 11 to 14 carbon atoms were active against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Antimicrobial activity against gram-positive organisms increased with increasing chain length and carbon-14 to 18 amines were active at 1 to 5 ppm. The carbon-11 to 13 alkyl amines were most active against gram-positive organisms; longer chain amines (more than 14 carbons) were inactive. Branching of the alkyl chain caused a loss of activity against gram-negative but not against gram-positive bacteria. Antimicrobial testing of monoamines, polyamines, and the influence of order substituents were investigated to correlate structure-acitivity relationships.
TI  - [Antibacterial effect of Ankerplast Spray].
AB  - The diffusion test yielded no satisfactory results. In the tube test, both the spray and the solvent (in a dilution of 1:4 and 1:8, respectively) proved to be bacteriostatically active against enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Escheria coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These germs were killed within 30 minutes in the test for bactericidal activity, whereas the reference substance (1% phenol) required 1--2 hours, except against the last-named germ. Even the copolymer exerted a bactericidal effect, it is true, but only within 8 or 24 hours. The following results were obtained from the spray test with agar plate cultures: Streptococcus viridans species, streptococci, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Escheria coli, and Proteus were killed, whereas others survived under the plastic film for up to 9 days. Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had grown through the film within 7 days. In vivo experiments demonstrated a very potent antibacterial activity on the skin under the spray film.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of azlocillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, and ticarcillin, alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The in vitro activities of the newer semisynthetic penicillins azlocillin, mezlocillin, and piperacillin were compared with those of ampicillin and ticarcillin by using 290 clinical laboratory isolates. Piperacillin and mezlocillin were the most active against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was tested, piperacillin and azlocillin were more active than either mezlocillin or ticarcillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae species were highly susceptible to all of the penicillins tested. Ticarcillin had relatively poor activity against enterococci. The rate of bacterial killing with multiples of the minimal inhibitory concentration of azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin was tested for E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, and Klebsiella spp. Increasing concentrations increased the bactericidal effect. The effect of combining azlocillin, ampicillin, or ticarcillin with an aminoglycoside was studied by using both killing curves and checkerboards. The isobolograms constructed from the checkerboards showed a synergistic pattern for the organisms tested, which included E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., P. mirabilis, and enterococci. However, the rate of killing was increased by the combination only for P. aeruginosa and enterococci.
TI  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis for rapid identification of blood-culture isolates.
AB  - A total of 303 blood cultures that were positive by examination of Gram-stained smears were tested immediately by counterimmunoelectrophoresis for detection of bacterial antigens. Antigen was detected in all 82 blood cultures containing Streptococcus pneumoniae and 11 of 22 with Klebsiella pneumoniae, two of two with Haemophilus influenzae, and one of one with Neisseria meningiditis. False-positive cross-reactions in 265 tests occurred only with pneumococcal Omniserum in two cases of nongroupable streptococcal bacteremia and with Klebsiella antiserum in one case of Escherichia coli bacteremia (1.1%). A specific identification of the microorganisms at least 24 hours earlier than by subculture technics was accomplished in 91% of the cultures containing the aforementioned bacteria. The procedure was not useful for detecting antigen in blood cultures containing Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis of blood cultures. Temporal Relationship of positive Gram stain to positive counterimmunoelectrophoresis.
AB  - Counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), Gram staining, and quantitative measurements  were performed on simulated blood cultures at hourly intervals after inoculation with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae. The CIE became positive either at the same time as the Gram stain or within the ensuing five hours. In no case was CIE positive when the Gram stain was negative. The numbers of colony-forming units milliliter necessary for a positive CIE result varied with the types of microorganisms. The procedure of CIE appears useful as a rapid screening technic for identification of bacteria in blood cultures when microorganisms are seen in Gram-stained smears.

AB  - 14 patients from the Allergy Unit of an outpatient clinic suffering from acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and 13 outpatients with acute bronchitis were treated with 250 mg cefaclor (Panoral) 3 times daily per os for 5 days. 59% of the organisms isolated from cefaclor-sensitive sputum at the time of prominent clinical symptoms were resistent to tetracycline, 53% of them were resistant to penicillin, and 37% were resistant to ampicillin. 12 out of the 14 patients with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis became asymptomatic, and no organisms could be detected in the sputum of 13 out of the same 14 patients two days after cessation of cefaclor treatment. In 12 out of the 13 patients with acute bronchitis, the acute clinical symptoms disappeared and in 11 out of the 13 patients the initial sputum organisms were two days after stopping cefaclor treatment.
TI  - BL-S786 (ceforanide), a new parenteral cephalosporin: in vitro studies.
AB  - BL-S786 (ceforanide) is a new cephalosporin which showed broad-spectrum activity  in vitro against 453 clinical isolates. At a concentration of 3.12 mug/ml, it inhibited greater than 75% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Essentially no activity was observed against isolates of Serratia marcescens, and only minimal activity was observed against Enterobacter spp. Its activity was directly related to the size of the inoculum. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were similar to the minimal inhibitory concentrations for isolates of all organisms except S. aureus and S. pyogenes. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were considerably higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations for these organisms.
TI  - Bacterial allergy in allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma.
AB  - Nineteen patients suffering from allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma were studied for bacterial allergy with Staphylococcus aureus, Kelbsiella pneumoniae and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Allergy skin tests, provocative tests and the Migratory Inhibition Factor were employed. The correlation indicates to the authors that bacterial allergy is more important than bacterial "infection" as a cause of allergic rhinitis and asthma in many instances. This is often overlooked by practicing allergists.
TI  - Studies on the inhibitory effects of zinc heptanoate on microorganisms.
AB  - Inhibitory effect of zinc heptanoate was observed on different cultures of bacteria and fungi. Growth of all the bacteria was inhibited by the compound. Greatest inhibition was seen in the case of Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, S. paratyphi A, S. paratyphi B, Vibrio cholerae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and E. coli whereas least inhibition was found in the case of Staphylococcus aureus. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was least for Klebsiella pneumoniae (800 p.p.m.) while in the case of Staph. aureus and Bacillus subtilis it was 200 p.p.m. Among yeasts and fungi greatest inhibition was found with Trichophyton schoenleini, T. rubrum, T. gourvili, Microsporum adouini, M. vanbreuseghemi and least in the case of Candida albicans. In triethanolamine: water (1:1) solution the MIC for T. schoenleini and T. gourvili and T. violaceum was as low as 900 p.p.m. whereas in the case of Aspergillus oryzae it was highest--3500 p.p.m. The effect of the compound on glucose consumption of Aspergillus niger and Bacillus subtilis was also seen.

A correlation appears between the kinetics of fosformycin antibacterial action and the microbial growth rate.
TI  - [Studies in the BALB/c mouse of the efficiency of spraying as compared to other inoculation ways for immunostimulant (author's transl)].
AB  - The of efficiency of spraying as compared to intranasal and digestive ways was tested on Balb/c mouse by using on the one hand an immunostimulant product and on the other various types of test : Myxovirus influenzae by aerosol, Streptococcus pyogenes intranasally, Klebsiella pneumoniae intraperitoneally. Results showed that in the case of influenza virus the immunostimulant inhaled as liquid aerosol or powder aerosol, or deposited on the nasal mucosa was very active. When the test germ was Streptococcus and the contamination intra-nasal, only the homologous way was efficient. When the test germ was Klebsiella pneumonia all inoculation forms except powder aerosol were effective. The comparative study of aerosols granulometry helps grasping this phenomenon.
TI  - The bacteriological culture of equine uterine contents, in-vitro sensitivity of organisms isolated and interpretation.
AB  - A total of 19 pathogenic bacterial species was isolated from uterine swabs of 498 out of 1539 mares over 4 years. The swabs were taken by 5 veterinary clinicians using 2 different techniques. Bacterial contamination during swabbing was minimized by scrupulous attention to cleansing of the external genitalia and the perineal area, and in the handling of the culture specimen. The most prevalent organisms isolated were beta-haemolytic streptococcus (39%), Escherichia coli (27%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (7%). Interpretation of microbiological findings correlated well with clinical findings when number of organisms isolated and endometrial cytology were considered. The use of a bacterial transport medium combined with sophisticated culture methods reflects a more accurate picture of the uterine microflora than can be obtained by previous techniques. Streptococci isolated were uniformly sensitive to penicillins. The sensitivity of E. coli and K. pneumoniae towards chloramphenicol, gentamicin and polymyxin was nearly 100%. The selection of an appropriate antibacterial agent depends upon sensitivity, pharmacological action, genital tract status and cost. This study shows that a Gram stain of uterine cytology can be used to diagnose quickly and select an appropriate antibiotic for treatment prior to culture results if sufficient numbers of organisms are present.
TI  - Quantitation of skin bacteria: lethality of the wash solution used to remove bacteria.
AB  - A widely used technique for the quantitative removal of bacteria from the skin uses a detergent, Triton X-100 (p, t-octylphenoxynonaethoxyethanol), to remove and suspend the bacteria. We determined the half-life for the survival of five common skin bacteria suspended in the solution. The shortest-lived was Streptococcus pyogenes with a half-life of 0.9 hours. All of the others (Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) had half-lives of 1.5 hours or longer. K. pneumoniae, the only Gram-negative species tested, had a half-life of more than 30 hours. Thus, a one hour delay in plating and incubation of samples suspended in this detergent solution inhibits quantitation of most species tested.
TI  - Emergence of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, 1935-1975.
AB  - A limited review of the changes in susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens to available antibacterial agents is presented. Significant developments in recent years include the following: (1) the emergence of Streptococcus pneumoniae with decreased resistance to penicillin and of some strains resistant to several antibiotics; (2) a decline in prevalence of multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after 1960 following their increasing prevalence in the preceding years (these changes were methicillin-resistant (and multi-drug-resistant) S. aureus and the marked differences in their prevalence in different areas (these changes also were related to appearance of new phages in those organisms); (4) an increasing resistance to multiple drugs among enterococci but not among viridans streptococci or among nonenterococcal group D streptococci; (5) the emergence of beta-lactamase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae; (6) the emergence and spread of sulfonamide-resistant Neisseria meningitidis; (7) the occurrence of beta-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and occasional strains resistant to chloramphenicol; (8) the focal occurrence of chloramphenicol-resistant Salmonella typhi in Vietnam and in epidemic form in Mexico; (9) the demonstration of marked differences in prevalence of resistance to multiple drugs in common pathogens to the most widely used antibiotics in different geographic areas. The dominant factor in the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, whether in hospital wards or in the community, is clearly the intensive use of the antibiotic agents to which resistance emerges and then spreads.
TI  - [In vitro activity of cefaclor (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study was conducted on the in vitro activity of cefaclor and other  oral cephalosporins against a large number of freshly isolated clinical strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The activity of cefaclor against gram-positive pathogens is very similar to that of cephalexin. The action of cefaclor against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior. Cefaclor is the most active antibiotic against strains of Haemophilus influenzae, and is also more active than cephalexin and cephradine against non-beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus mirabilis.
TI  - Laboratory studies with BL-S 578 (Cefadroxil) a new broad-spectrum orally active  cephalosporin.
AB  - BL-S 578 (Cefadroxil) is a new orally active semisynthetic cephalosporin antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The new compound was evaluated in vitro in comparison with cephalexin. Some properties studies such as, antibacterial activity, binding with serum proteins and stability in acid and neutral solution at 37 degrees C for both cephalosporins were similar. In experimental infections of mice, the protective action of BL-S 578 was more effective than cephalexin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. BL-S 578 was more resistant than cephalexin to the beta-lactamases produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

TI  - More on cross-reactions of Pneumococci and Klebsiella.
AB  - Earlier studies are extended to the higher-numbered K-types of Klebsiella, several of which may now be fitted into the previously found groups. Additional correlations between chemical structure and serological specificity are given, not only among the higher K-types, but also for several which were previously uninterpretable because structures were not known at the time. K1, K5, K6, K7 and K56 are shown to form a related group, although the reasons for their cross-reactivities are not always the same.
TI  - The capsules of Corynebacterium equi and Streptococcus equi.
AB  - The capsules of Corynebacterium equi and Streptococcus equi were examined by electron microscopy after staining with ruthenium red. They were compared with the capsule of Klebsiella pneumoniae which had previously been examined using the same procedure (Springer & Roth, 1973). The capsule of C. equi had a laminated appearance. When S. equi was grown on solid medium, its capsule appeared as radially arranged projections capped by a thick electron dense layer. When grown in liquid medium, S. equi produced a capsule which showed as short thick projections with no layer external to them.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Evidence that L-rhamnose is the antigenic determinant of hyporesponsiveness of BALB/c mice to Klebsiella pneumoniae type 47.
AB  - The genetic polymorphism in early, immunoglobulin M, responsiveness to the Klebsiella pneumoniae type 47 polysaccharide (K47-PS) is determinant specific, and L-rhamnose is probably the determinant against which differential responsiveness is expressed. This is inferred from tests of the response to the cross-reacting Streptococcus pneumoniae type 23 and non-cross-reacting pneumococcal polysaccharides of known chemical construction. B10.2/Sn new-line mice are high responders and BALB/c mice are low responders to K47-PS. Upon immunization with killed S. pneumoniae type 23, these strains produce cross-reacting antibody to K47-PS. The cross-reacting antibody responses of these strains are congruent with their responses to K47-PS.
TI  - Cyclic pharyngeal lymphoiditis: immunological considerations.
AB  - This communication presents the concept that recurrent infections of the lingual  tonsils, lateral pharyngeal lymphoid bands and lymphoid follicles on the posterior pharyngeal wall, occurring with the same periodicity, is a cyclic clinical and immunological entity. These patients lacked resistance to the normal flora of the nasopharynx and pharynx. They were accordingly treated with a mixed respiratory bacterial vaccine, administered intradermally and according to a formulated program, to improve resistance or immunity of the lymphoid tissue. These patients showed definite improvement by this method of therapy. It is suggested that the effectiveness of therapy was accomplished through the immunological process of cell-mediated immunity. The immunobiologic development of cell-mediated immunity by T thymic-dependent cells and humoral immunity by B cells is briefly discussed.
TI  - Activity of 5-episisomicin compared with that of other aminoglycosides.
AB  - 5-Episisomicin, a semisynthetic aminoglycoside, has been shown to inhibit many members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. At a concentration of 3.1 mug/ml, more than 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, indole-positive Proteus, and Providencia were inhibited. 5-Episisomicin had activity against S. aureus, E. coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Citrobacter similar to gentamicin and netilmicin. It had activity similar to amikacin and netilmicin against many gentamicin-resistant bacteria. The activity of 5-episisomicin was greatest at an alkaline pH and in medium of low magnesium content. Synergy of 5-episisomicin and carbenicillin was found to occur most often against Pseudomonas.
TI  - The effect of complement depletion on lung clearance of bacteria.
AB  - We have investigated the effect of hypocomplementemia on early pulmonary clearance of four species of bacteria. The experiments were performed in an inbred animal model to minimize immunologic variability. Complement was depleted by cobra venom factor, and activity in serum was monitored with a phagocytic assay. Bacterial specific antibodies were examined by an indirect radioimmunoassay, and animals with high levels of activity were excluded from anaysis. 4 h after aerosolization with Streptococcus pneumoniae, complement-depleted animals had cleared only 75% of the initial number of organisms, whereas saline-treated controls cleared 91% (P less than 0.01). Aerosolization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was followed at 4 h by a twofold greater growth of organisms in the complement-depleted animals (446% of original deposition) as compared to the saline-treated controls (211% of original deposition) (P less than 0.02). Clearance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were similar in complement-depleted animals and saline-treated controls. These experiments suggest that hypocomplementemia predisposes to bacterial pneumonia and may explain the high incidence of pulmonary infections in patients having impaired complement activity. Our results further indicate that varying defense mechanisms may be involved with clearing the lung of differing bacterial species.
TI  - [Basic and clinical studies on new semisynthetic penicillin, PC-904, in pediatric field (author's transl)].
AB  - PC-904 was administered to 16 pediatric patients and the following basic and clinical results were obtained. (1) PC-904 was administered 20 approximately 30 mg/kg. The serum peak level of PC-904 after drip intravenous infusion over 1 hour was 66.7 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 67.8 minutes. PC-904 was administered 25 approximately 30 mg/kg intravenous one shot injection was 49.4 microgram/ml at 1 hour and T 1/2 of PC-904 was 52.2 minutes. (2) Urinary excretion rate was about 20% up to 6 hours after drip intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg. In a case of intravenous one shot injection of 25 approximately 30 mg/kg, the excretion rate was 11.9 approximately 19.9%. (3) PC-904 was administered 60 approximately 120 mg/kg/day for 3 approximately 48 days to 5 cases of sepsis and bacterial endocarditis, 6 of pneumonia, 2 of sss syndrome (staphylococcal scald skin syndrome) and 3 of pyelonephritis. Clinical effects were excellent in 11 cases and good in 5 cases, effective ratio being 100%. (4) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter anitratus and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904, and Hemophilus influenzae isolated from clinical specimens disappeared by the treatment of PC-904. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae reduced. (5) As to the side effect by PC-904, s-GOT and s-GPT were elevated in 2 cases. Anemia, rash and fever were observed in each 1 case out of 16 patients though the causal relation with the agent was unknown.
TI  - Homologous and cross-reactive precipitins in anti-pneumococcal sera raised in mules.
AB  - Serial bleedings were obtained from two mules during prolonged immunization, one  with type XXV the other with type VIII pneumococcal vaccine. IgGa, IgGb, IgGc, IgB, IgG(T) and IgM present among purified Pn anti-XXV and Pn anti-VIII immunoglobulin isolated from various bleedings were identified by use of rabbit anti-equine heavy chain specific reagents. Radioimmunodiffusion with 14C-labelled type XXV pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide and horse and donkey reagents with species specificity directed against donkey or horse IgGa respectively, demonstrated both parental horse and donkey IgGa heavy chain isotypes among the anti-PnXXV antibodies of the interspecies hybrid. Qualtitative and quantitative examination of the cross-precipitation of mule anti-PnXXV sera with the capsular polysaccharides of pneumococcal types IV, X and XA, with birch sap, ketha gum, and with polysaccharides of E. coli, Klebsiella and Rhizobium was carried out and compared with data obtained with anti-PnXXV raised in a horse. Analysis of supernatants from the cross-reactions showed that distinct subfractions had reacted. indicating a marked heterogeneity of the antibodies.
TI  - Immuno-stimulation by a ribosomal vaccine associated with a bacterial cell wall adjuvant in humans.
AB  - We have studied a new vaccine of ribosomal nature associated with glycoprotein cell walls from Klebsiella pneumoniae which served as an immunoadjuvant. Thus vaccine was administered by the aerosol route to working men free of any important disease, especially of respiratory disease. A total of 104 men working for the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, all volunteers, were randomly placed into two groups. During the first period, 51 patients (group I) were vaccinated three times a week during 5 weeks, and the second group was used as control. During the second period, which started on day 225, the control group received the vaccine, and the first group was revaccinated. Results of this experience show a significant difference in the immunity of the two groups. The specific antibodies increased with vaccination as illustrated by chi-square test (Yates correction), which corresponds to an independent probability equal to 0 (P = 0.5 X 10-4).
TI  - Degradation of the polysaccharide component of gonococcal lipopolysaccharide by gonococcal and meningococcal sonic extracts.
AB  - An extract made from the supernatant of Neisseria gonorrhoeae Gc2 strain 1291 degraded the Gc2 polysaccharide antigen. Chemical analysis of this polysaccharide indicated it contains glucose, galactose, glucosamine, galactosamine, glucosamine-6-phosphate, heptose, 2-keto-3-deoxyotonate, and ethanolamine and is the polysaccharide component of gonococcal lipopolysaccharide. Degradation of the polysaccharide by sonic extracts resulted either in complete loss of antigenicity and immunogenicity or in partial degradation to subunits that could inhibit the Gc2-specific hemagglutination inhibition. The factors responsible for degradation were destroyed by heating at 100 degrees C for 5 min or by Pronase digestion, but were unaffected by ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, Mg2+, Ca2+, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. The process was pH dependent, with optimal activity occurring at pH 7. Sonic extract supernatants from group B and C meningococcal strains contained degrading properties, whereas similar extracts produced from Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae type II failed to degrade the Gc2 polysaccharide.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Bacterial infections, sensitivity patterns, and chemotherapy among hospital patients in the tropics.
AB  - A prospective clinical and bacteriological review of the pattern of bacterial infections and chemotherapy among 1931 patients admitted to University College Hospital, Ibadan, between July and September, 1976, showed that 394 patients (20%) had bacterial infections, but 940 patients (49%) received antimicrobial chemotherapy. Thus 58% of the patients were treated either prophylactically or without bacteriological confirmation of infection. Infections of the respiratory tract were commonest (28%), followed closely by wound infections (26%). Septicaemia accounted for 20% of all infections and this was particularly common among children. There was a preponderance of infections due to gram-negative bacteria (69%), with Klebsiella spp. being the most frequently encountered. Among the gram-positive organisms, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for the majority of the infections, particularly infections of wounds, while Salmonellae were responsible for the majority of septicaemias, except among young children, where Klebsiella spp. were predominant. Approximately 90% of urinary tract infections were caused by Klebsiella, Escherichia coli and Proteus spp. Almost all the patients with meningitis were children (93%) and the commonest infecting organisms were Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most commonly used antibiotics (penicillin, streptomycin and ampicillin) did not bear a close relationship to the sensitivity patterns of bacteria causing infections in the hospital. Comparison of the bacterial sensitivity patterns for 1963, 1967, 1974 and 1976 showed that the current usage of antibiotics had led over the years to increasing proportions of resistant organisms.
TI  - Pyogenic meningitis in Ibadan, Nigeria. A 15-month prospective study.
AB  - Between January 1976 and March 1977, cerebrospinal fluid samples from 2130 patients at University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria were examined, 130 patients were shown to have pyogenic meningitis. The commonest causative bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (53.8%), Haemophilus influenzae (23%), Neisseria meningitidis (7.7%) and Klebsiella spp. (3%). Most of the infections occurred in very young children: 47% of all patients were under 1 year of age, and 69% were under 5 years old. The overall case fatality rate was 30% (Strep. penumoniae infection 28.6%, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis infection both 20%). All 4 patients with klebsiella infection died. There was a noticeable increase in the incidence of Strep. pneumoniae strains showing resistance to tetracycline, between 1974 and 1976, and this was attributed to the widespread use and abuse of the antibiotic among the general population. Two strains of H. influenzae were found to be resistant to ampicillin; such strains have not previously been reported from Nigeria. The results of the study support the use of a combination of ampicillin and gentamicin in the initial treatment of pyogenic meningitis in Ibadan.
TI  - Clinical experience with cefadroxil in upper and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - Cefadroxil is a new semisynthetic oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Absorption of cefadroxil is unaffected by food, its serum levels are prolonged and it is excreted in the urine at a relatively slow rate compared to cephalexin. In the treatment of 108 patient with upper or lower respiratory tract infections, cefadroxil effected 93% complete cures. Fifty-five of the patients had upper respiratory tract infections and fifty-three had lower respiratory tract infections; among them cefadroxil acheived clinical success rates of 100% and 96%, respectively. Cefadroxil was clinically successful in eight (89%) out of nine patients whose infections were caused by mixed aetiologies. The principal causative agents were Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Overall bacterial eradication produced by cefadroxil was 112 (91%) of 123 organisms isolated from 108 patients. Reports of mild and transient side-effects in only 3.7% of the patients showed that the drug was well tolerated.
TI  - Piperacillin (T-1220), a new semisynthetic penicillin: in vitro antimicrobial activity comparison with carbenicillin, ticarcillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin.
AB  - Piperacillin (T-1220) is a new semisynthetic penicillin with an unusually broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. In vitro comparisons of this drug with 6 other beta-lactam antimicrobics (ticarcillin, carbenicillin, ampicillin, cephalothin, cefamandole and cefoxitin) were conducted. These included minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against 394 bacterial isolates, the minimal lethal concentrations (MLC) against 79 of those, as well as the effect of inoculum size on the MIC and MLC of the drugs. Piperacillin had significantly greater activity than did the other penicillins against Pseudomonas species and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Against P. aeruginosa piperacillin was 8- and 16-fold more active than ticarcillin and carbenicillin, respectively. The MLC of piperacillin rarely differed from the MIC by more than one log2 dilutions except against P. aeruginosa in which the MLC was 4-fold greater or more than the MIC of 45% of isolates tested. Ticarcillin, carbenicillin and cefoxitin showed minimal inoculum size effects. Cefamandole results showed the greatest inoculum size variation with 55% and 37% of isolates showing an 8-fold increase in MIC and MLC respectively by increasing inoculum from 10(5) to 10(7) CFU/ml. Piperacillin was intermediately effected having 25% of strains greater than 8-fold increase in MIC.
TI  - Reactivity and inhibitor potential of hydroxycitrate isomers with citrate synthase, citrate lyase, and ATP citrate lyase.
AB  - The four isomers of hydroxycitrate have been tested as substrates and inhibitors  for citrate synthase, citrate lyase, and ATP citrate lyase. None of the isomers served as a substrate for citrate synthase and they were moderate to weak inhibitors of this reaction. Of the four isomers, only (pncit)-(2S)-2-hydroxycitrate did not serve as a substrate for citrate lyase while (pncit)-(4S)-4-hydroxycitrate was the only isomer which did not serve as a substrate for ATP citrate lyase. No consistent pattern of reactivity or inhibitor potency was seen with the different isomeric hydroxycitrates. It is proposed that more than one mode of binding is possible between the isomers and the three different active sites.
TI  - Ticarcillin: a collaborative in vitro comparison with carbenicillin against over  9,000 clinical bacterial isolates.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations of ticarcillin and carbenicillin were determined for 9,236 clinical bacterial isolates by the broth microdilution method at four participating laboratories. Ticarcillin showed significantly increased activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (P less than .001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P less than .001) and Aeromonas hydrophilia (P less than .005) when compared to carbenicillin, but no signifcant differences were observed against other gram-negative organisms. Ticarcillin was consistently less active against the gram-positive cocci, and these differences were significant for Staphylococcus aureus (P less than .001), Streptococcus agalactiae (P less than .001), Staphylococcus epidermidis (P less than .001) and Streptococcus viridans (P less than .005). Significant regional and institutional differences in susceptibility to the two drugs were observed for several species, including common nosocomial pathogens such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
TI  - The syndrome of post-splenectomy fulminant sepsis. Case report and review of the  literature.
AB  - Three years after splenectomy, a middle-aged woman had two separate episodes of fulminant bacterial sepsis. She recovered each time with prompt and appropriate treatment. Her immunologic system was examined and found to be normal with respect to antibody formation against diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, granulocyte killing of staphylococci and serum opsonizing activity. Granulocytes, bursa-equivalent (B) and thymus-dependent (T) lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulins were quantitatively normal. She produced antibody against subcutaneously injected polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine. She demonstrated cutaneous anergy. The literature on this syndrome was reviewed in an attempt to ascertain why hyposplenic patients are subject of fulminant bacterial, chiefly pneumococcal, sepsis. The probably explanation is the delayed production of antibodies against the phagocytic-resistant capsule of certain bacteria which the host had not previously encountered. The incidence of this syndrome appears to be on the order of 0.5 to 1.0%/year for splenectomized older children and adults. As the syndrome is seen chiefly in splenectomized or othewise hyposplenic patients, a causal relationship seems to exist.
TI  - Intramammary infections in a dairy herd with a low incidence of Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus infections.
AB  - In a dairy herd with a low incidence of intrammary infections due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, clinical mastitis remained a serious problem despite good control of nonclinical mastitis through postmilking teat disinfection and antibiotic therapy of known infected quarters at the end of lactation. During the 2-year study, the incidence of clinical mastitis was 0.88 cases/cow-year; 32.2% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 33.5% by gram-negative organisms. Among all new infections detected, 54.1% were caused by streptococcal species other than Str agalactiae and 25.7% by gram-negative bacteria. Among new infections, 41.6% occurred during the nonlactating period or within a few days of calving. Incidence of clinical mastitis was highest in the 1st month of lactation. Among 84 gram-negative infections, 42.8% were caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, 20.2% by Escherichia coli, and 23.8% by Enterobacter spp. Among the many serotypes of K pneumoniae and E coli, none was predominant.
TI  - Determinants of lung bacterial clearance in mice after acute hypoxia.
AB  - Net lung bacterial clearance in normal mice is determined by the balance of in vivo bacterial multiplication on the one hand, and the defense mechanisms of mucociliary clearance and phagocytosis and killing by the oxygen-dependent alveolar macrophage on the other. The bactericidal function of the macrophage is the major component of the defense mechanism. The effect of acute hypoxia on the defense mechanism was studied in mice exposed to aerosols of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Physical clearance was not impaired by acute hypoxia, and bacterial replication was not stimulated by the low oxygen atmosphere. Clearance of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli was impaired during acute hypoxia due to decreased phagocytosis or killing by the alveolar macrophage. The important human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae was cleared normally in the presence of acute hypoxia. This observation suggests that an oxygen-independent clearance mechanism is important in lung defense against the pneumococcus. This may be a separate mechanism within the alveolar macrophage or a system as yet unidentified.
TI  - General principles of antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - In the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause  is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. In severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. The need for optimal dosage is emphasized. This is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. The problems leading to recurrence and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.

TI  - Bacterial adherence to nasal mucosal cells.
AB  - The ability of several bacterial species to adhere to human nasal mucosal cells and their distribution on nasal mucosal surfaces was studied. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa adhered to scraped nasal mucosal cells. In contrast, viridans streptococci and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited feeble or no adherence to nasal mucosal cells. S. aureus affinity for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers of S. aureus was greater than for those of the noncarriers (P less than 0.005). Heat treatment of S. aureus did not block, but slightly reduced, its binding to mucosal cells. The data suggest a high degree of specificity involved in the adherence of bacteria to nasal mucosal cells. The greater affinity of S. aureus for the nasal mucosal cells of carriers (than noncarriers) seems to be a property of mucosal cells rather than bacteria.
TI  - Demonstration of cryoprecipitable immune complexes in pneumococcal pneumonia.
AB  - Cold-insoluble protein complexes (cryoprecipitates) can be found in the serum in  a variety of infectious diseases. We studied serum cryoprecipitates isolated from three patients with pneumococcal pneumonia by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CEP) and immunofluorescent technics for the presence of immune complexes. The cryoprecipitates and supernatant serum were tested for pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PCP) by CEP at 37 C and 56 C with the appropriate controls. Antibodies against PCP in the cryoprecipitates and the supernatant serum were detected as follows. Streptococcus pneumoniae from each case was fixed onto slides. The slides were incubated with each cryoprecipitate and supernatant serum at 37 C, and further incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antisera to human IgG, IgM, and IgA. The slides were examined with an immunofluorescent microscope. PCP was demonstrated in all of the cryoprecipitates. IgG antibodies against PCP were detected in all of the cryoprecipitates, while IgM antibodies were detected in Cases 1 and 2, and IgA antibodies in Case 1 only. Complement components of C3 and C4 also were demonstrated in the cryoprecipitates by CEP. These findings suggest that some patients with pneumococcal pneumonia have cryoprecipitable-immune complexes consisting of PCP and its antibodies.
TI  - Bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  - Using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. The biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). Fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. The most common ones were Klebsiella, Enterococcus, and Escherichia coli. The only anaerobe isolated was Clostridium perfringens. Eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. This study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system; therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.
TI  - Cross-protective immunity to Gram-negative bacilli: studies with core glycolipid  of Salmonella minnesota and antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Two immunoprophylactic approaches to the control of infections caused by gramnegative bacilli were evaluated by study of experimental infections in animals. The core glycolipid antigen derived from the Re mutant of Salmonella minnesota R595 is shared by virtually all enteric bacteria, and immunization with this endotoxin protects against the hemodynamic sequelae of bacterial infection and pyrexia without enhancing intravascular clearance of bacteria. The degree of protection afforded by active and passive immunization with core glycolipid was significantly less than that conferred by type-specific immunization. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae share capsular antigens with some strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; by the mechanism of enhanced opsonization, antibodies to S. pneumoniae may cross-protect against infection with E. coli or K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Nosocomial bacteremia. Potential for prevention of procedure-related cases.
AB  - During a six-month period, 187 inpatients had bacteremia associated with community-acquired infection and 91 patients had bacteremia from a nosocomial infection. The most frequently identified sites of infection in both types of bacteremia were the respiratory and urinary tracts. Escherichia coli and Diplococcus pneumoniae were the organisms most frequently isolated from cultures of patients with community-acquired bacteremia, and E coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella were most frequently isolated from patients with nosocomial bacteremia. Bacteremic nosocomial infections were related to urinary catheters, respiratory and intravenous therapy, or hyperalimentation in 32 of the 91 cases. Even assuming the unproved hypotheses that rigid adherence to current guidelines would prevent all of these procedure-related cases, 59 cases of bacteremia would still have occurred. This emphasizes the need for further research into prevention of nosocomial infection.
TI  - Penetration of cefazolin into pleural fluid.
AB  - Single doses of cefazolin, 500 mg intramuscularly and 1 g intravenously, were administered to 16 patients having lung pathology who were scheduled for thoracic fluid aspiration. Pleural fluid and serum samples were taken at intervals of 30 to 240 min for determination of cefazolin levels. The levels obtained were variable; however, the levels of cefazolin in pleural fluid generally exceeded the reported minimal inhibitory concentration values for Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus, and group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. In addition, the pleural fluid levels exceeded the minimal inhibitory concentration for cefazolin against most of the Klebsiella and Haemophilus influenzae strains. These data show that cefazolin, despite its comparative high protein binding, produces levels in the pleural fluid capable of inhibiting the organisms commonly found in respiratory tract infections.
TI  - [Studies on the antimicrobial effect of vitamin D (author's transl)].
AB  - In in vitro studies vitamin D3 proved inhibitory on strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. In the presence of 5x10(4)-9x10(4) IU/ml vitamin D3 the organisms were killed or reacted with a marked growth inhibition.
TI  - Anaerobic and aerobic bacteriology in head and neck cancer surgery.
AB  - A prospective study of wound infections following major head and neck cancer surgery was undertaken to define a rational approach to trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and initial therapy of these infections. Preoperative aerobic cultures were taken from the planned site of skin incision and from the oropharynx. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures were obtained from all wound infections. Patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics were excluded from the study. The data indicate that preoperative cultures are not usually predictive of the bacteriology of subsequent wound infection. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were cultured from most wound infections, and usually reflected normal anaerobic oropharyngeal flora, exogenously acquired Staphylococcus aureus, or both. Bacteroides fragilis was not cultured in this series. Antibiotics selected for trials of prophylaxis or initial treatment of these infections should cover both the resident oral aerobic and anaerobic flora and S aureus. Coverage for B fragilis does not appear necessary. Antibiotic choices might include penicillin G plus a penicillinase-resistant penicillin or a parenteral cephalosporin.
TI  - [Growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  - The efficacy of the commercially available Vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). The media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. Analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. From the results obtained with strains of Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides splanchnicus, Sphaerophorus necrophorus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the Vacutainer culture tubes, whereas Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor.
AB  - Inhibitory activity of cephalexin, cephradine, and cefaclor was compared by the WHO-ICS agar dilution technique. Cefaclor was substantially more active against staphylococci, streptococci, gonococci, meningococci, Haemophilus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, salmonellae, and shigellae than was cephalexin, which in turn was more active than cephradine. Cefaclor appeared to be less resistant to staphylococcal penicillinase than did the other two agents. None of these cephalosporins was active against Enterobacter, Serratia, indole-positive Proteeae, Pseudomonas, or Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of some new furan quaternary salts.
AB  - A series of new N-(5-substituted 2-furfuryl)-N,N-dimethyl-N-aryloxyalkyl quaternary ammonium salts relating to general structure IV has been synthesized by reacting 5-substituted 2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)furans IIa-d with appropriate aryloxyalkyl bromides III. The resulting compounds are tested for in vitro antimicrobial activity. A simpler synthesis of 5-nitro-2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)furan (IId) involving the reduction of N,N-dimethyl-5-nitro-2-furamide (Ib) with diborane is described. A new compound, 5-bromo-2-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)furnan (IIc), is prepared in a similar way. Many of these compounds (22, 28, 34, 37-42, 44, and 45) indicate high activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and are more active than nitrofurantoin, Compounds 22, 34 and 41 exhibit the highest in vitro antibacterial activity in the series. Some of these quaternary salts (22, 25, 37, 37-41, and 60) possess appreciable activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. None of these compounds show significant antifungal activity. Eight compounds (18, 21, 22, 26-28, 32, and 34) have high in vitro antibacterial activity were inactive when tested for anthelmintic activity in rats against Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Hymenolepis nana.
TI  - Fosfomycin in acute bronchopneumopathies.
AB  - Fosfomycin has been tested in 25 adult patients with bronchial or bronchopulmonary acute processes, of which 13 were simple acute processes of a greater or lesser severity, and 12 acutenesses of chronic bronchial processes. The germs found most frequently in the sputum cultures were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella. Fosfomycin was used intramuscularly with doses of 4 g/day, for an average of 10 days. The results obtained were 16 cures, 7 improvements and 2 failures, which represents 92% success with 8% failures.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of fosfomycin in clinical studies.
AB  - Since fosfomycin has behaved in vitro as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, an attempt  has been made to evaluate this behaviour in controlled clinical study carried out at different Spanish hospitals. A total of 959 patients were treated for some of the following infectious clinical processes: gonococcal urethritis, typhoid fever, enterocolitis, acute and chronic urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, chronic otorrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis, peritonitis, surgical and suppurative infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngoamygdalitis, burns, endometritis, ocular infection, whooping cough and nasal carriers of S. aureus. The results obtained as a function of the microorganism isolated in these clinical processes in percentage of clinical and bacteriological success have been 96% of the S. aureus infections, 95% of the Streptococcus sp. including S. pneumoniae, 90% of the N. gonorrhoeae infections, 94% of the E. coli infections including enteropathogenic E. coli, 90% of the S. marcescens infections, 76% of the Proteus sp. infections, 72% of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter infections, 66% of P. aeruginosa infections and 78% of the S. typhi infections.

As expected, the last reacts more strongly in antipneumococcal (anti-Pn) VIII and X than does intact K1. K65 and K67 precipitate much of the same large fraction of anti-PnXXIII as does K47, showing that K65 and K67 also possess lateral non-reducing end-groups of L-rhamnose. The massive reaction of K83 in anti-PnII confirms the chemically demonstrated non-reducing end-groups of D-glucuronic acid in the repeating unit, Such groups, or 1,2-linked D-glcA, will probably also be found in K71.
TI  - [Microbial resistance to formaldehyde. I. Comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  - The resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. As test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis), fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), bacteriophages (Escherichia coli phages, T1, T2, T3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). For the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees C) and pH (7.0). The microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (N/N0); where: N0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; N equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). For all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. In all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi-B were found to be more susceptible than Staphylococcus aureus (vf. Fig. 1 A). The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. To obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. Streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of Streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. For the killing of Candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. The conidia of Aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of Candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of Staphylococcus aureus (see Fig. 1 B). In the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. If the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The spores of Bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. To reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...
TI  - [Infective situation in a cow barn contaminated with Klebsiella mastitis].
AB  - The infection situation in a four-row cow-house for 153 animals with a frequent occurrence of Klebsiella mastitis was subject to a detailed analysis. The following results were obtained after two collections of blood and udder-quarter milk samples examined by the test-tube agglutination, gel precipitation, and bacteriological diagnosis methods: 1. Streptococcus agalactiae was isolated from milk samples 28 and 31 times, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 15 and 19 times, Staphylococcus arueus 16 and 19 times, Klebsiella pneumoniae 6 and 6 times, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus once and 4 times, Enterobacter aerogenes twice and three times, and Escherichia coli twice. The authors failed to determine the causative agent in 26--38 cows (20--30%) with a pathologically changed secretion. 2. Double test-tube agglutination performed in a 30-day interval revealed suspected Klebsiella antibodies having a titre of 80 + + and higher in 13 dairy cows (12%); However, the suspicion was disproved by the negative results of gel precipitation. 3. The final deduction concerning the exogenic character of Klebsiella mastitis should encourage efforts for good housing, due nutrition, efficacious disinfection, and hygienic milk production.
TI  - Susceptibility of recently isolated bacteria to amikacin in vitro: comparisons with four other aminoglycoside antibiotics.
AB  - In vitro tests for susceptibility to amikacin and to four other aminoglycoside antibiotics were carried out with strains of many bacterial species by use of an agar dilution method and an inocula replicator. In general, amikacin was as active as or more active against most of the organims than kanamycin, neomycin, and streptomycin; in particular, amikacin was active against strains resistant to one or more of these three antibiotics. Amikacin was more active than gentamicin against strains of Nocardia asteroides and Providencia stuartii and also against gentamicin-resistant strains of some other gram-negative bacilli, notably Serratia marcescens. However, gentamicin was more active than amikacin against most of the other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that were tested. In comparative tests of four media, minimal inhibitory concentrations MICs) were greater in tests with Mueller-Hinton agar, and generally somewhat lower in those with heart infusion agar, than in tests with trypticase soy agar and nutrient agar. Inocula of a 1:1,000 dilution of culture generally gave MICs lower than those obtained with undiluted cultures; the differences were small with enterococci, but they were greater with amikacin than with gentamicin in tests on strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings generally confirm those previously reported by others.
TI  - [Devitalizing effect of Jodonal A in vitro on bacteria subject to a short-term exposure].
AB  - In a three-minute exposure in vitro Jodonal A devitalized a culture of serological group B streptococci in a 2% concentration, Staphylococcus aureus in a 16% concentration, Pneumococcus in a 4.5% concentration, Corynebacterium pyogenes in a 2.5% concentration, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a 3% concentration, and Klebsiella pneumoniae in a 2% concentration. Hence Jodonal A concentrations higher than 16% should be tested for udder teat disinfection after the removal of teat cups.
TI  - [Determination of the effective concentration of Jodonal a for the disinfection of the skin and teats after milking].
AB  - The bactericidal effectivity of Jodonal A in 1:10, 1:5, and 1:3 solutions was tested on human skin and on the teats of cow mammary glands. The 1:3 dilution ratio proved best for three-minute exposure. Jodonal A used in this concentration in 522 cows for the post-milking disinfection of teats for 10 months exerted no harmful effect on the skin of the mammary glands.

TI  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin C derivative I. In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Ceftezole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic similar to cefazolin, has the following chemical structure: (6R,7R)-8-oxo-7[2-(1H-tetrazol-1-yl)acetamido]-3-[(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylthio)meth yl]-5-thia-1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-ene-carboxylic acid. Ceftezole was found to be a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active in vitro against many species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria except Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Proteus vulgaris. The activity of ceftezole against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. appeared to be nearly equal to that of cefazolin and higher than those of cephaloridine and cephalothin. Cross-resistance was observed between ampicillin and cephaloridine, but not between ampicillin and ceftezole, in susceptibility tests on clinical isolates of P. mirabilis. The in vitro activity was little affected by the inoculum size, the presence of human serum or the test medium. Ceftezole exhibited apparent bactericidal activity at the concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against both S. aureus and E. coli. The development in vitro of resistance by S. aureus 209p and E. coli NIHJ to ceftezole after 16 transfers was similar to or somewhat slower than that to other drugs tested. Ceftezole was relatively stable in nutrient broth and minimally degraded in the serum or tissue homogenates of rats. Ceftezole, in a single subcutaneous administration, exhibited somewhat less efficacy in mice against intraperitoneal infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae or P. mirabilis than either cephaloridine or cefazolin. However, ceftezole exhibited efficacy similar to that of cephaloridine or cefazolin when administered in three doses. Furthermore, ceftezole was as effective as cefazolin in the treatment of experimental abscesses in mice caused by subcutaneous inoculation with S. aureus.
TI  - [Approach to a practical method for screening and identifying microorganism genera from urine (author's transl)].
AB  - In this study the author reported upon a practical new system for screening and identifying the microbial agents causing urinary tract infections. This system is composed of a combination of 3 screening procedures (pH-value + nitrite-test + catalase-test) and 8 selective culture media for the purpose of genus identification within 24 hours (Uripret-G). A total of 130 cultures was investigated. The employed microorganisms were mainly recovered from urine samples. They included the following species: Candida albicans, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus inconstans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Proteus rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. Employing coded cultures not only monoinfections but also multiinfections in urine samples were simulated. Under the circumstances of investigation it was possible with the help of the new system to reidentify the genera of all but two of the 130 employed microorganisms.
TI  - Factors influencing the immune enhancement of intrapulmonary bactericidal mechanisms.
AB  - The effect of specific immunization on the antibacterial defense mechanisms of the murine lung was assessed against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Immunization by aerosol inhalation significantly enhanced the intrapulmonary killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis but not the remaining organisms. With P. mirabilis, systemic immunization induced higher titers of specific serum agglutinins as compared with local respiratory tract immunization; however, local immunization was more effective in enhancing pulmonary bactericidal activity than was parenteral vaccination. Passive immunity against P. mirabilis or aerogenic challenge with preopsonized P. mirabilis significantly enhanced intrapulmonary killing of the homologous organism. With S. aureus, pulmonary bactericidal activity was not accelerated by aerosol challenge with the preopsonized organism, nor was it accelerated in passively immunized mice. These data demonstrate that the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity is governed by the bacterium used for challenge and the route of immunization. The results further demonstrate that with P. mirabilis, antibody-mediated mechanisms are involved in the immune enhancement of pulmonary bactericidal activity.
TI  - Laboratory evaluation of 3-(5-tetrazolyl) penam, a new semisynthetic beta-lactam  antibacterial agent with extended broad-spectrum activity.
AB  - In the new agent 3-(5-tetrazolyl)penam, hereafter referred to as CP-35,587, the carboxyl function at C3 in the penicillin nucleus has been replaced with the 5-tetrazolyl moiety. Marked changes in spectrum and resistance to gram-negative beta-lactamases, particularly with regard to Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, were conferred by this modification. The anti-Klebsiella activity clearly distinguishes the antibacterial spectrum of CP-35,587 from any known broad-spectrum penicillin. Compared to orally active cephalosporins, the spectrum advantage of CP-35,587 encompasses Enterobacter, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter, Providencia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus faecalis, both in vitro and in murine infections produced by many of the above-named microorganisms. Thus, CP-35,587 combines and extends the antibacterial activity of broad-spectrum penicillins and orally active cephalosporins.
TI  - Survival of bacteria in seawater using a diffusion chamber apparatus in situ.
AB  - A microbiological survival chamber for in situ environmental studies involving microorganisms of public health significance was developed. The autoclavable chamber was provided with a supportive base for proper flow orientation and a battery-powered stirring mechanism for continuous internal agitation. The performance of the chamber and its ancillary units was evaluated in estuarine waters by diffusion studies and survival tests with eight species of bacteria isolated from environmental sources. Polycarbonate filter membranes were found superior to cellulosic filter membranes. Continuous mixing enhanced diffusion and ensured uniform cell suspension. Salmonella enteritidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibited somewhat greater viability than Escherichia coli under similar conditions. Of three indicator organisms tested, Streptococcus faecalis was the most persistent. In general, the data obtained indicate the usefulness of the chamber in measurements of microbial survival in the natural marine environment.
TI  - Effect of capsular polysaccharide of Klebsiella pneumoniae on host resistance to  bacterial infections. I. Induction of increased susceptibility to infections in mice.
AB  - When Klebsiella pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide (CPS-K) from type 1, Kasuya strain, was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) immediately before i.p. bacterial challenge, the survival time of mice infected with Salmonella enteritidis NUB 1 (virulent strain) was shortened and the mortality rate for mice infected with S. enteritidis NUB 31 (avirulent strain) was enhanced. The promotion of infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 by CPS-K depended upon its dose, the effect of CPS-K being demonstrable up to as little as 0.2 mug per mouse. In the case of S. enteritidis NUB 31, the effect of CPS-K was detectable only when more than 20 mug per mouse was injected. As a result of enumeration of bacterial populations in the peritoneal washing, blood, liver and spleen, it was revealed that CPS-K promoted in vivo growth of S. enteritidis NUB 1 and NUB 31. In addition, CPS-K enhanced the mortality rate in mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The peak CPS-K effect on infection with S. enteritidis NUB 1 was seen when given immediately before bacterial challenge. The active substance responsible for the infection-promoting effect of CPS-K was neutral CPS-K, which is distinct from the O antigen and from acidic CPS-K (the type-specific capsular antigen). Preparations of neutral CPS-K isolated from the other three strains of K. pneumoniae exhibited a marked infection-promoting effect comparable with that of preparations from the Kasuya strain. Neutral CPS-K, with identical antigenicity to that from the Kasuya strain, has already been found to exert a strong adjuvant effect on antibody responses to various antigens in mice. No parallelism exists between infection-promoting activity and adjuvant activity of neutral CPS-K.
TI  - Acute severe mastitis in cows of the Dutch-Friesian Breed (author's transl).
AB  - One hundred cases of severe acute mastitis are reported. Bacteriological examination of the milk was negative in 23% of the cases. E. coli was most frequently found to be the causative organism (23%), followed by St. aureus (19%), C. pyogenes (10%), Str. dysgalactiae (9%), Str. agalactiae (5%) and a number of other pathogenic agents such as atypical streptococci, Str. uberis, haemolytic streptococci, Aerobacter aerogenes, Kl. pneumoniae, a clostridium and P. multocida. In several cases, a tentative diagnosis may be based on the clinical symptoms, which is then found to be correct on bacteriological examination of the milk. The prognosis will vary with the causative organism. Treatment was life-saving in more than 90% of the cases, the milk-producing capacity of the affected quarter being completely preserved in 36% and partly preserved in 27% of the cases.

TI  - Nonspecific resistance to infection induced in mice by a water-soluble adjuvant derived from Mycobacterium smegmatis.
AB  - The effect of a nontoxic, water-soluble adjuvant (Neo-WSA) from delipidated cells of Mycobacterium smegmatis on the susceptibility of mice to infection with four challenge organisms was studied. An intravenous dose of 1 mg of Neo-WSA per mouse 24 hr before challenge enhanced resistance to infection with a fungus (Candida albicans), a gram-negative bacterium (Klebsiella pneumoniae), and a gram-positive bacterium (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Protection by Neo-WSA was not significant when the mice were challenged with a malarial parasite. Plasmodium berghei. When 1 mg of Neo-WSA was given intravenously to mice 10 min before challenge with C. albicans, protection was significant, but when the same dose was given two or six days prior to challenge, mice were not protected. The concentration of iron in serum had not changed significantly 1 or 24 hr after the intravenous injection of 1 mg of Neo-WSA. Thus Neo-WSA is capable of inducing nonspecific resistance to certain experimental infections in mice. The protection afforded by administration of Neo-WSA 10 min before challenge, the lack of protection afforded by administration of Neo-WSA six days before challenge, and the lack of significant change in the serum iron concentration clearly separate this compound from bacterial endotoxins, which are classical inducers of nonspecific resistance to infection.
TI  - [Current resistence situation in a surgical and urological department].
AB  - Spectrum and sensitivity of bacteria were studied at the Surgical (534 positive wound smears) and the Urological Clinics (7879 urine specimens). Krankenhaus Nordwest, Frankfurt/M., during the period of 1969-1971 and in 1973. The most common organisms identified in wound smears were E. coli, followed by Staph. areus, Aerobacter and Proteus species. E. coli were also predominant in urine, but followed by Enterococci, Proteus and Pseudomonas. E. coli, Proteus species and especially Pseudomonas increased in number whereas Enterococci decreased. There was no pronounced increase in resistance to 9 current antibiotics as well as to chemotherapeutics during the observation period which was particularly striking in the case of Ampicillin used on a large scale. The results of our study support the presently employed therapeutic method using bactericidal antibiotics of the penicillin group in strict indications.
TI  - Bacterial mastitis in guinea pigs.
AB  - Necropsy of 37 guinea pigs revealed mastitis to be the primary cause of death in  70% of these animals. Epidemiologic study failed to establish correlation between age, parity, or litter size and the onset of mastitis. The disease did not appear to be contagious. Although mastitis frequently developed during lactation, survivability of offspring was unaffected. The agent most consistently isolated from affected mammary glands was Escherichia coli (17 of 37). Other isolates in decreasing order of occurrence were Klebsiella pneumaniae (6 of 37), Streptoccus zooepidemicus (2 of 37), and Proteus sp (1 of 37). The etiologic agent of 111 cases was undetermined.
TI  - Determinants of lung bacterial clearance in normal mice.
AB  - The determinants of the lung clearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were studied in normal mice after exposure to an aerosol of viable bacteria and 99mTc-labeled dead bacteria. The fraction of bacteria in lungs that remained viable 4 h after exposure were: S. pneumoniae, 7.3%; K. pneumoniae, 121%; E. coli, 88.5%; S. aureus, 27.6%. The rate of physical removal of bacterial particles (Kmc) was determined from the change in lung 99mTc counts with time: Kmc ranged between 7 and 12%/h and and was similar in all species. The rate of mucociliary clearance and of intrapulmonary bacterial killing (Kk + Kmc) was calculated from the change in bacterial counts with time in animals that had received tetracycline to inhibit bacterial multiplication. Kk, the rate of intrapulmonary killing, was obtained by subtraction of Kmc from (Kk + Kmc). The calculated values for Kk were: S. pneumoniae, - 87%/h; K. pneumoniae, - 17%/h; E. coli, - 18%/h; S. aureus, - 22%/h. The rate of intrapulmonary bacterial multiplication (Kg) was estimated from the relationship of bacterial counts in tetracycline and nontetracycline-treated animals, assuming that tetracycline altered only Kg. Kg, expressed as the doubling time, was: S. pneumoniae, 310 min; K. pneumoniae, 217 min; E.coli, 212 min; S. aureus, infinity (no multiplication). The data indicate that the marked differences in the clearance of these species from the normal mouse lung result from the interaction of differing rates of in vivo bacterial multiplication and killing.
TI  - Polymicrobic bacteriuria: significant association with bacteremia.
AB  - Current clinical practice states that a urine culture yielding three or more isolates must be considered a contaminated specimen and discarded. The validity of this practice was tested by reviewing all patients at the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital with positive blood cultures for 1 year to determine how many were associated with polymicrobic bacteriuria (two or more urine isolates each present at greater than 10(5) colonies/ml). During 1973 there were 18 patients who had bacteremia associated with a urinary tract infection in which the same organism with the identical antibiogram was found in both the blood and the urine of these 18 patients with monomicrobic bacteremia 11(61%) had polymicrobic bacteriuria, with a mean of an additional 1.75 urinary pathogens present in significant quantities. In these patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria, an indwelling bladder catheter was present for a mean period of 4.4 months before the episode of bacteremia. Only 5 of the 11 patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria had temporally associated urinary tract manipulation. Monomicrobic bacteriuria occurred in seven patients (39%). The mean indwelling bladder catheter time was 0.9 days, and urinary tract manipulation near the time of bacteremia occurred in all seven patients. Prospectively, nine other patients with polymicrobic bacteriuria were recultured by one of us to be certain that appropriate collection and transportation methods were used; the presence of polymicrobic bacteriuria was repeatedly demonstrated in 7(78%). This study illustrates the clinical importance of polymicrobic bacteriuria.
TI  - In vitro studies of cefamandole.
AB  - Cefamandole is a new cephalosporin antibiotic that was tested in vitro against 540 clinical isolates of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli. A concentration of 0.39 mug/ml inhibited 95% of the isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. A concentration of 6.25 mug/ml inhibited over 90% of the isolates of Proteus mirabilis and Escherichia coli, 69% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 31% of the isolates of indole-positive Proteus spp. and Enterobacter spp. It was active against most cephalothin-resistant isolates of E. coli but not of K. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Aerobic flora examination of sputum (author's transl)].
AB  - The routine bacteriological test of expectorate, except for mycobacteria, is usually unsatisfactory. There is a need of standardization which results in the present paper from a comparison between the data obtained by two different laboratories on the same samples. It is possible to achieve reasonable and uniform results establishing a uniformity of some procedures, namely; collection of specimens, homogenization, number and type of media, interpretation of data and so on.
TI  - [Study on the viscolytic activity of the sputum (author's transl)].
AB  - Several mucolytic agents were evaluated on sputum for testing their viscolytic activity and the bacterial tollerance to each of them. Proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, papain, pancreatin), KJ, and dithiothreitol (or its derivatives) were better tollerated by common respiratory pathogens (H. influenzae, D. pneumoniae, Klebsiella, etc.) than other mucolytic agents, as acetil-cysteine, cisteamine-HCl, tension active substances, mercaptoethanol, and others. The dithiothreitol showed also one of the strongest viscolytic effect and therefore it was selected for the routinary sputum digestion at the concentration 0.1% in PBS pH 7.2. Such a solution was added to sputum specimen in different proportions according to the macroscopic "apparent" viscosity of each specimen. However researches on the comparative viscolytic activity of all the agents hereinafter considered are still in progress.
TI  - [Bacteriological examination of sputum (author's transl)].
AB  - The AA., emphasizing the importance of ascertain the bronchial source of microorganisms recoverable from sputum, recommend for this purpose the use of properly collected sputum specimens and the application of washing treatment for mucopurulent materials. The aim of the present study has been to verify the effectiveness of mechanical apparatus to homogenize sputum without affecting the viability of resident microorganisms and the usefulness of prior microscopical examination to establish the rate of dilute inocula for the culture.
TI  - [Gentamicin-susceptibility of various pathogens isolated from clinical materials].
AB  - We studied on the antibacterial activity of gentamicin against various pathogens  isolated from clinical materials mainly isolated during 1974 and 1975, comparing with other antibiotics. Beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci are less susceptible to gentamicin than staphylococci. Staph, aureus and Staph. epidermidis resistant to various antibiotics are very susceptible to gentamicin, and no resistant strain to this drug was found. Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae and H. parahaemolyticus are very susceptible to gentamicin, and there is no resistant strain to this drug. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Serratia and five species of Proteus are more susceptible to gentamicin and tobramycin than dibekacin and amikacin. A few resistant or less susceptible strains to gentamicin are found in E. coli, Citrobacerr, Serratia, Pr. morganii and Pr. rettgeri. Pr. inconstans is less susceptible to gentamicin than other species of Proteus. Antibacterial activity of gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa is very strong, but dibekacin and tobramycin are stronger. Gentamicin-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are now rather few.

TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro activity of cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cefoxitin, cephamycin C, cepharadine and cefazolin was determined against 443 isolates of bacteria. At a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml, all of the cephalosporins inhibited more than 60% of the isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae. At the same concentration, cephalexin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cephapirin, cephamycin C and cefazolin inhibited more than 90% of isolates of proteus mirabilis. All of the cephalosporins except cephalothin and cephapirin inhibited over 60% of isolates of Escherichia coli at a concentration of 12.5 mug/ml. Cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against gram-negative bacilli. There was substantial differences in the activity of cephalosporins against gram-positive cocci. Cephaloridine was the most active cephalosporin against these organisms. There was considerable fluctuation in the proportion of isolates of gram-negative bacilli susceptible to these cephalosporins from year to year, but there was no evidence to suggest that the number of resistant isolates was increasing.
TI  - [Possible relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune-adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis (author's transl)].
AB  - In the present study we attempted to determine the relationship between bacterial surface structures, immune adherence, chemotaxis and phagocytosis. As shown in table 1 encapsulated bacteria (Klebsiella ozanae, K. pneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae and M. fermentans had a much lower immune adherence-activity than non-encapsulated bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Brucella abortus, Erysipelothrix insidiosa, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi). Consequently, the former bacteria, in the absece of specific antibodies, activated complement via the C-3-bypass to a smaller extent than the latter. In modified Boyden chambers the encapsulated bacteria and the mycoplasmas were much less cytotaxigenic than the non-encapsulated bacteria (table 3). Corresponding to this was the chemotactic response in vivo. Finally the rates of phagocytosis were considerably lower with the encapsulated bacteria than with the non-encapsulated ones (fig. 1).

TI  - Urease activity in the rumen of sheep and the isolation of ureolytic bacteria.
AB  - Urease activity in the sheep rumen varied with the diet of the sheep, but appeared to be largely or entirely present in the small bacterial fraction. Screening of over 1000 strains of rumen bacteria isolated on different media showed that urease activity was apparently confined to species of Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus casei var. casei and Klebsiella aerogenes. Consideration of the numbers in which these occurred and their activities suggested that the bacteria could not be responsible for the total rumen urease activity. By enrichment culture a ureolytic strain of Streptococcus faecium was isolated. This had a higher urease activity than the other bacteria and occurred in higher numbers in the rumen. It could live with other bacteria in the rumen of a gnotobiotic lamb in numbers, and with a urease activity, comparable with those in the normal sheep rumen. The other properties of the bacterium also suggested that it would grow and produce urease in the rumen, but was unlikely to retain its urease activity after isolation. It was concluded that this bacterium was the main source of rumen urease in roughage-fed, and probably other, sheep.

AB  - The results of bacteriological studies made between 1964 and 1971 by workers at the Varia Laboratory, Institute of Medical Microbiology on 767 patients treated at the Clinic of Gnathofacial Surgery, Department of Medicine, Friedrich Schiller University at Jena, are evaluated. The testees (x=275) were included in groups with specific diagnoses, and a breakdown was made according to the detection of aerobic pus-forming germs. Gram-positive cocci were detected in 92% of the cases and their pathogenetic representatives, 76,5% of the cases. Rodshaped germs (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas) were observed only in 37,9% of the cases. Staphylococcus aureus, which accounted for 62,5%, was the most frequently observed species. It was followed, in order of frequency of detection, by greening streptococci and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Monoinfection was far more frequently observed than multi-infection. Also, the problems associated with the differentiation of streptococci are pointed out since other investigators found streptococci to be the most frequent agents producing odontogenic infections.

TI  - Adherence of bacteria to heart valves in vitro.
AB  - The abilities of 14 strains of aerobic gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli to adhere in vitro to human or canine aortic valve leaflets were compared. 2-mm sections of excised valve leaflets were obtained by punch biopsy and were incubated under standardized conditions in suspensions of bacteria. Valve sections were subsequently washed and homogenized, and quantitative techniques were used to determine the proportions of bacteria from the initial suspensions that had adhered to the valve sections. Comparable results were obtained when these adherence ratios were determined by two independent methods based either on measurements of bacterial viability or of radioactivity in 51Cr-labeled bacteria. For each bacterial strain, the adherence ratio was constant over a wide range of concentrations of bacteria in the incubation medium. Strains of enterococci, viridans streptococci, coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adherence ratios 0.003-0.017) were found to adhere more readily to valve sections than strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (adherence ratios 0.00002-0.00004). The organisms that most frequently cause bacterial endocarditis were found to adhere best to heart valves in vitro, suggesting that the ability to adhere to valvular endothelium may be an important or essential charcteristic of bacteria that cause endocarditis in man.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in infancy and childhood in Lusaka (One year prospective sturdy).
AB  - In approximately 10,000 admissions in a 12 months period, at University Teaching  Hospital, Lusaka 85 cases of meningitis were recorded. The signs and symptoms in these patients do not greatly differ from other similar studies in Africa. The commonest organism isolated was pneumococcus. There was high mortality rate which was to a large extent due to parents not bringing their children to hospital early enough for medical treatment to be instituted. This is borne out by the fact that 50% of the children with meningitis died within the first 24 hours. The C.S.F. protein and peripheral white blood count may be of prognostic value. Spasticity, cranial nerve palsises hydrocephalus and subdural effusion were the commonest complications.

The calculation of statistically significant differences between the various diagnostical results of both groups has confirmed that in asthmatic children virological infection of the respiratory tract, pathological findings in X-ray and lung function tests, bronchiectasis and secondary bacteriological invasion occurs statistically significantly more often than in nonasthmatic children.
TI  - Growth of common bacteria and Candida albicans in 10% soybean oil emulsion.
AB  - Bacterial and fungal growth in 10% soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) and 5% fibrin hydrolysate in 5% dextrose was studied at 4, 25 and 37 degrees C. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Str. fecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were grown in broth at 37 degrees C, diluted in saline and inoculated into each of the two preparations as well as a mixture of the two. Growth was measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours. In 10% soybean emulsion, all bacteria except S. pyogenes multiplied, but in fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solution the only organism of those studied to grow was S. aureus. In the hydrolysate-dextrose-lipid mixture, all organisms multiplied except S. pyogenes and P. aeruginosa. C. albicans grew in all solutions tested. While at 4 degrees C, organisms did not multiply. The fibrin hydrolysate-dextrose solutions given by infusion into a central vein for hyperalimentation have been shown to support predominantly fungal growth, and contamination of the solution and ultimately of the indwelling catheter is a constant hazard. Because both bacteria and C. albicans grew equally well in 10% soybean oil emulsion, its use as a caloric source when infused into a central vein may increase the occurrence of sepsis. When this emulsion is used to provide essential fatty acids or calories, it should be given via a peripheral vein, so that a central catheter will not be contaminated.
TI  - Abnormal forms of bacteria produced by antibiotics.
AB  - Subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics can produce in vitro aberrant forms of bacteria that are similar to those observed in specimens and cultures from patients being treated with antibacterial agents. Eight species of bacteria were grown on membranes placed on agar containing subinhibitory concentrations of nine antibiotics. The resulting organisms were examined by Gram stain and electron microscopy. Gram stains showed filamentous and granular forms of enterobacteria with bipolar staining, giant staphylococci, and rodlike pneumococci. Electron micrographs showed changes in the number and distribution of ribosomes in enterobacteria and septum abnormalities in cocci. Such abnormal forms can occasionally simulate the appearance of quite different species, and they may indicate the presence of a subinhibitory antibiotic concentration at the site of infection as a result of prior antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of methylsulfinyl and methylsulfonyl analongs of some nitrofurans.
AB  - The sulfoxides 5-methylsulfinyl-2-furaldehyde semicarbazone (2) and 1-[(5-methylsulfinyl-2-fufurylidene)amino]hydantoin (3) as well as the sulfones 1-[(5-methylsulfonyl-2-furfurylidene)animo]hydantoin (1) and 1-(5-methylsulfonly-2-furyl)-2-(6-amino-3-p-ridazyl)ethylene hydrochloride (4) have been prepared and tested for antibacterial activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The compounds are much less active than the corresponding 5-nitrofuran derivatives, possibly because their reduction potentials are too negative for them to interfere with reductive enzyme systems within the bacteria.

AB  - Gentamycin prepared at the All-Union Research Institute of Antibiotics did not differ by its antibacterial spectrum and the activity level from gentamycin samples from other countries. By its activity against clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa gentamycin was somewhat inferior than polymyxin but much more superior than carbenicillin. An agar-diffusion method using Bac. pumilus NTCC 8241 as the test microbe was developed for determination of gentamycin activity. The gentamycin sulfate complex and the components of gentamycin had the same activity levels, antibacterial spectrum and diffusion capacity.
TI  - Bacteremia at Boston City Hospital: Occurrence and mortality during 12 selected years (1935-1972), with special reference to hospital-acquired cases.
AB  - The cases of all patients hospitalized at Boston City Hospital during 1972 who had blood cultures positive for a clinically significant, aerobic bacterial pathogen or for Candida were analyzed with respect to incidence and mortality, sex, age, admission to medical or surgical services, and the causative organism. Similar data were obtained for 11 years between 1935 and 1969 selected to reflect the introduction and general use of various effective antibacterial agents. Comparisons were also made between hospital-acquired bacteremic infections (defined as those in which the first positive blood culture was obtained on or after the third day in the hospital) and community-acquired infections (defined as those with positive blood cultures on admission or within the first two days in the hospital). In 1972, the incidence of bacteremic infections (but not the case-fatality ratio) was significantly higher in males than in females. Bacteremic infections were more than twice as frequent on the medical than on the surgical services, but the case-fatality ratio was slightly but not significantly higher on the surgical services. Bacteremia wasteremia was most frequent in the youngest (birth through nine years) and the oldest (greater than or equal to 60 years) age groups, whereas the case-fatality ratio was lowest in the youngest group and increased with each decade of life. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most frequent organism causing bacteremia; next were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobacter, and Staphylococcus aureus, in that order...
TI  - Analysis of acetoin and diacetyl in bacterial culture supernatants by gas-liquid  chromatography.
AB  - The acetoin and diacetyl contents of culture supernatants of Voges-Proskauer-positive "viridans" streptotocci, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, were determined by a gas liquid chromatographic procedure, in which supernatants were extracted with diethyl ether and diacetyl was measured on columns of 10% (wt/wt) polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) at 73 C. Acetoin was converted to diacetyl, before analysis, by a simple oxidation procedure with ferric chloride and without a distillation step. Streptococcal culture supernatants were shown by this method to contain only acetoin; supernatants of K. pneumoniae and S. aureus contained both acetoin and diacetyl.

TI  - Bacterial studies of Clindamycin-associated colitis. A preliminary report.
AB  - The cause of pseudomembraneous colitis is not known but has been attributed to an alteration in the microbial flora of the colon. To test this hypothesis, a blind, prospective study was undertaken in which fecal samples were cultured quantitatively for aerobic and anaerobic organisms. The patients from which these samples were taken were all receiving clindamycin and had diarrhea secondary to the use of the drug. We were able to show definite differences in the colonic microflora which correlated with the presence of pseudomembranes on biopsy. Those patients who had diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis showed a striking decrease, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in the number of anaerobes present. Those patients who had diarrhea but no pseudomembranes had large numbers of anaerobes which qualitatively approximated normal fecal cultures but quantitatively were fewer in number. A third group of patients, which had resolving pseudomembranous colitis, and were no longer symptomatic, had large numbers of anaerobic organisms which approximated those found in normal fecal cultures. There were no differences among the three groups with regard to facultative anaerobic microflora. Thus, the presence of pseudomembranous colitis correlated directly with a striking quantitative and qualitative decrease in the anaerobic microflora of the colon. The symptom of diarrhea alone appeared to have no meaning with regard to changes in the bacterial flora. Resolution of pseudomembranous colitis was associated with a return of the anaerobic microflora.
TI  - Systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof N6-methylated adenine. It was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium, contain neither N6-monomethyl adenine (m6A) nor N6-dimethyladenine (m26A) in 23S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA). In the case of S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26A. (ii) The gram-negative strains Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6A but not m23A in 23S rRNA. These observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. Because of the demonstrated relationship between N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23S rRNA and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rRNA methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin B-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.
TI  - [Chemotherapy of purulent meningitis in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Purulent meningitis in patients admitted to the pediatric department of Kyoto University Hospital and affiliated institutions from 1951 through 1973 were studied with emphasis on the kinds of the causative organisms and the susceptibility of these organisms to antibiotics. The findings in this study have served to help select antibiotics most likely to be effective against this disease. The overall incidence of purulent meningitis was 0.68%. This figure decreased little throughout the period. As for the frequency of causative organisms, Neisseria meningitidis led the list, and Diplococcus pneumoniae ranked just behind. Haemophilus influenzae was rare. The frequency of N. meningitidis, however, decreased sharply in spite of the essentially unchanged overall incidence of this disease. The probable reason for the poor prognosis of this disease in spite of the remarkable strides in chemotherapy is the decreased frequency of N. meningitidis and the inversely increased organisms that are resistant to usual chemotherapy. The therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin against this disease was studied in 15 children including eight newborns and four infants. The daily per kg bodyweight dose was 50 mg or less in four, 50 approximately 100 mg in five, and more than 100 mg in the remaining six. The route of administration was either intramuscular or intravenous. No deaths occurred. The rate of effectiveness was as high as 80%. Residual symptoms were recorded in six and, in as many as five of them, the cause was a-tributable to the delayed detection of the disease. Neither side effects nor aberrent laboratory findings attributable to large doses of cefazolin were recorded. Diffusibility of cefazolin into the CSF was studied in nine subjects. The CSF concentration of this antibiotic was shown to be somewhat lower than that of ampicillin or cephaloridine and to account on an average for 13% of the mean peak serum level. This relatively low diffusibility will be offset by its high serum concentration and safe large-dose therapy. These findings have clearly shown that the therapeutic effectiveness of cefazolin is as high as that of ampicillin, and that this excellent effectiveness holds true even when the causative organism happens to be Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, etc. that are resistant to ampicillin. The authors have furthermore scrutinized much literature on the frequency of the causative organisms, emergence of resistant strains, and the diffusibility of antibiotics into the CSF, and arrived at the conclusion that cefazolin is a promising antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in newborn. The daily dose is preferably 150 mg/kg or more given in three divided intravenous doses. Meanwhile ampicillin proved to be useful as the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of purulent meningitis in infants and children.
TI  - [Comparison of the antibacterial activity of amikacin (BB-K8) with other aminoglycosides against pathogens recently isolated from clinical materials (author's transl) ].
AB  - We determined the antibacterial activity of amikacin against 1,277 strains of pathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical materials during 1974, including beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and compared the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of this drug with gentamicin, dibekacin, tobramycin and kanamycin. 1)Antibacterial activity of amikacin against beta hemolytic streptococci, pneumococci and enterococci was as weak as the other four aminoglycosides, but against Staph. aureus, Staph. epidermidis, various groups of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed amikacin the good antibacterial activity as gentamicin, dibedacin and tobramycin, and also showed the good activity against kanamycin resistant strains. 2) Amikacin has the similar antibacterial spectrum as gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin, but its antibacterial activity is generally weakest among these four drugs. 3) On many strains tested the cross resistance is observed between amikacin and one of gentamicin, dibekacin and tobramycin, but several strains of Proteus morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa which have rather large MIC against gentamicin, dibekacin or tobramycin showed rather small MIC against amikacin.
TI  - Comparative inhibitory activity of BL-S640 and two other cephalosporins.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of BL-S640 was compared to that of cephalothin and cephalexin against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from clinical specimens. BL-S640 demonstrated the best activity on nearly all microbial species studied, except for Haemophilus influenzae and Diplococcus pneumoniae against which cephalothin was slightly more active.
TI  - Massive empyema due to Citrobacter diversus.
AB  - Citrobacter diversus is a gram-negative rod member of the Enterobacteriacease family. A patient is described from whom this organism was isolated twice in pure culture from empyema fluid. Our isolates of Citrobacter diversus were resistant to ampicillin and carbenicillin and sensitive to cephalothin. Citrobacter diversus should be distinguished from Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. This organism joins Streptococcus pyogenes, bacteroids species, anaerobic streptococci and Escherichia coli as a cause of slight pneumonia with extensive empyema.
TI  - Interference with alpha-antitrypsin studues in stored serum by presumed bacterial proteases.
AB  - Contamination of werum by certain gram-negative bacteria has been shown to spoil  the serum for measurement of trypsin inhibitory capacity (STIC) or for antitrypsin phenotyping. Such sera develop intense fibrinolytic activity when the STIC has dropped to itsminimal level, but antitrypsin concentration as measured by radial immunodiffusion remainsconstant. Cultures of ENTEROBACTER, Klebsiella, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas species were shown to have this capability, but production of the fibrinolytic enzyme by the bacteria was most proficient in the presence of human serum. The enzyme is believed to be of bacterial origin because of its lack of esterase activity, and because activation of serum plasmin by streptokinase did not affect the STIC. Care mustbe taken to avoid bacterial contamination of blood that is to be submitted for an STICassay and/or antitrypsin phenotyping. Serum should be prepared quickly, frozen soon,and stored and transported in a frozen state.
TI  - Microflora of maize prepared as tortillas.
AB  - Very little is known of the microflora in tortillas, the major component in the diet of many Guatemalans and other Central Americans. Based in a Guatemalan highland Indian village, this study examined the types and amounts of bacteria, yeasts, and molds in tortillas and in their maize precursors. Coliforms, Bacillus cereus, two species of Staphylococcus, and many types of yeast were the main contaminants, but low concentrations of alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, facultative Clostridium, and other bacterial types were also found. When tortillas were first cooked, the bacterial counts dropped to 1,000 or fewer organisms per g, a safe level for consumption. Under village conditions, bacterial counts regained precooking levels (about 10(8) organisms/g) within 24 h and rose even higher after 48 h. Reheating caused very little change; hence, bacterial levels remained very high in old tortillas kept for later consumption. A search for the sources of contamination showed that most came from water used in preparation and from the soiled hands of women preparing the tortillas. As an attempt to correct certain nutritional needs of the population, the Institute of Nutrition for Central America and Panama initiated a tortilla fortification project in the Guatemalan village. The bacterial counts in fortified tortillas did not differ significantly from those in oridinary tortillas. Furthermore, the level of contamination was constant among tortillas of different sizes and among tortillas made from different types of maize.
TI  - Occurrence of Klebisiella pneumoniae in surface waters.
AB  - The occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae in surface waters was not found to be ubiquitous. When it was isolated, Escherichia coli could also be found. The fecal coliform to fecal streptococci ratio suggest that its origin could be human, animal, or mixed sources.
TI  - Transient bacteremia associated with percutaneous liver biopsy.
AB  - Transient bacteremia associated with percutaneous liver biopsy was studied by pour-plate blood cultures, which were obtained immediately before and after the procedure and 5, 10, 15, and 30 min later in 89 patients. Part of the liver tissue was also cultured in all patients. Histological diagnoses included hepatitis, cirrhosis, cholangitis, fatty liver, granulomata, metastatic liver disease, lymphoma, and miscellaneous disorders. All blood cultures obtained before liver biopsy were sterile. Bacteremia was demonstrable in 12 patients (13.48%). In most of these patients, blood cultures were positive for as long as 15 min after liver biopsy; all cultures were negative at 30 min. Among the bacteria associated with 12 episodes of bacteremia were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides, enterococci, diphtheroids, Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patients with positive liver biopsies had a higher incidence of bacteremia (83.3%) than did the patients whose liver biopsies were sterile (8.r%); this difference is stastically significant (P smaller than 0.01). Thus, liver biopsy can be associated with transient bactermia.
TI  - Comparison of the germicidal activity of prepodyne and betadine surgical scrub solutions.
AB  - Two iodophoric surgical scrubs soaps, Prepodyne and Betadine, were evaluated for  bacteriocidal activity in a modified phenol coefficient test. A standard inoculum of each of 18 species of microorganisms was mixed with a 1:8 dilution of each iodophor and subcultured after one, three, and five minutes of exposure. Complete cidal activty was exhibited by both Prepodyne and Betadine. Twenty-five subjects were tested in hand washing experiments using Betadine and Prepodyne surgical scrub solutions. Quantitative fingerprint cultures were obtained before and after hand washing. Betadine resulted in an 85.2 per cent plus or minus 24 per cent decrease; Prepodyne, and 83.6 per cent plus or minus 21 per cent decrease. It can'be concluded from this data that there is no difference in bacteriocidal effectiveness between the two scrub soaps.

TI  - Cephalothin and cephaloridine therapy for bacterial meningitis.
AB  - The efficacy of cephalothin and cephaloridine in the treatment of bacterial meningitis was evaluated from a review of 106 cases reported in the literature. Fifty-nine percent of 34 patients treated with intravenous cephalothin responded suboptimally; those receiving daily doses of 12 g or more fared significantly better (P less than 0.025). In contrast, 74% of 72 patients treated with cephaloridine responded favorably; those who received concomitant intrathecal cephaloridine responded significantly better (P less than 0.005). These findings indicate that cephalosporin therapy for bacterial meningitis, without concomitant intrathecal medication, is unreliable and that this is probably due to inadequate penetration of the antibiotics into cerebrospinal fluid. In penicillin-allergic patients with pneumococcal, meningococcal, and hemophilus meningitis, chloramphenicol is the agent of choice. For staphylococcal meningitis, intravenous cephalothin at doses of 12 g/day with additional intrathecal cephaloridine at doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day should be administered concomitantly.
TI  - Bacteriologic flora of aspiration-induced pulmonary infections.
AB  - The role of anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms in the genesis of pneumonia or lung abscess in patients with historical, clinical, and radiologic findings suggestive of aspiration was compared to their role in similar patients without these findings. Bacterial specimens were obtained by transtracheal aspiration or thoracentesis. Anaerobes were isolated in 100% of the patients who were aspiration-prone as contrasted with only 20% of those who were not. Isolation of a single species or no growth was more common in the nonaspiration group, whereas multiple isolates were more common in the aspiration group. Patients with lung abscesses were treated with penicillin and all of them responded clinically, despite occasional recovery from the culture specimen of penicillin-resistant organisms. This suggests that lung abscess may be the result of a synergistic bacterial infection.
TI  - [Therapeutic effect of lividomycin on infections of the respiratory tract (author's transl)].
AB  - Therapeutic effect of lividomycin was observed in patients with infections of the respiratory tract (infections in association with bronchiectasis, mixed infections of cavities after negative conversion of tubercle bacilli, pneumonia, and so forth). Significant improvement of clinical symptoms was observed in 15 cases and no improvement in 4 cases. Lividomycin was administered at a dose of 1 g/day for 3 to 15 days. Staphylococcus aureus (9 cases), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1 case), alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus (3 cases), Aerococcus (4 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case) were suggested to be causative organisms in the above-mentioned patients. (In one case, however, causative organism was not determined.) Lividomycin seemed to be effective in cases of infections with Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas not effective in a case of infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In order to differentiate causative organisms from the organisms constantly existing on the upper respiratory tract, alkali treatment was employed as an aid for the determination of the causative organisms. However, further studies are desirable for the evaluation of this procedure.
TI  - Agglutinin response to bacterial infection in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
AB  - Agglutinin titres to Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris in the serum of patients with acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, patients producing mucoid sputum, and healthy controls were determined. Serological evidence of infection with H. influenzae was found in 38 of 57 patients with acute exacerbations, and Str. pneumoniae infection in 10 of the 57 patients, but was generally absent from healthy control subjects and from patiens producing mucoid sputum. No serological evidence of infection with other organisms named above was found to be associated with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Ten patients with acute exacerbations were without serological evidence of infection by any of the bacteria tested.
TI  - [Clinical effects of lividomycin on respiratory tract infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis (author's transl)].
AB  - Patients with various respiratory infections, primarily wet cases of bronchiectasis, were treated with lividomycin (LVDM) at a dose of 1 g/day for about a week. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Of the 15 patients with refractory bronchiectasis who had previously been treated with various other antibiotics, 11 patients (73.3%) responded to LVDM. Although there was no patient who responded to LVDM excellently, good cures were achieved in 5 pateints and fair cures in 6 patients. 2. In bronchiectasis patients having infections in association with pulmonary tuberculosis (mixed infections), LVDM did not show any remarkable effects, excepting that fair cures were achieved in 3 patients. 3. In the 7 patients with acute bronchopneumonia, excellent, good and fair cures were achieved in 1, 5 and 1 patient, respectively. Although LVDM was effective in all of the patients with the said infection, the number of the patients responded excellently was meager and the onset of action seemed to be somewhat slow. 4. In one patient with lobar pneumonia, LVDM was not effective. 5. The MIC values of LVDM for clinically isolated various organisms are summarized below: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 mcg/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.13 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Haemophilis influenzae 1.56 to 6.25 mcg/ml, Diplococcus pneumoniae 50 mcg/ml, alpha-Streptococcus 50 to 100 mcg/ml, beta-Streptococcus 100 mcg/ml, and Staphylococcus aureus 1.56 mcg/ml. 6. In spite of the fact that a majority of the patients participated in this study were the aged, LVDM's side effects were limited to an increase of BUN (one patient) and eruption (one patient). Any noticeable changes in hepatic and renal function, hearing acuity, etc. were not observed. As indicated above, LVDM was effective against, respiratory infections as well as infections of the urinary tract on which a considerable number of research has already been reported. Thus, it is considered to be worthwhile to use LVDM for the treatment of respiratory infections.

TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activities of cephalosporin antibiotics: cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cephalexin.
AB  - The antibacterial activities of 4 cephalosporin antibiotics, cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalothin and cephalexin, against 330 isolates of bacteria from patients at National Taiwan University Hospital, were determined by an agar plate dilution technique. Cephalosporins possess strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria except Enterococci. Staphylococcus aureus is the most susceptible among the organisms tested. More than 90% of Staphylococcus aureus strains are suppressed by cefazolin, cephaloridine and cephalothin at the concentrations of 3.13 mug/ml or less, except that 49.1% are suppressed by cephalexin. The relative potency of cephalosporins against Staphylococcus aureus in decreasing order is cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cephalexin. The gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis are less susceptible to cephalosporins than the gram-positive cocci. Among the cephalosporins, cefazolin is the most active against the gram-negative pathogens tested. The relative potency of antibacterial activity of cephalosporins against E. coli in decreasing order is cefazolin, cephaloridine, cephalexin, and cephalothin. One hour after the intramuscular injection of 500 mg of cefazolin, the maximum concentration of 33.3 mug/ml is reached in the serum. The sufficient high levels are sustained for 8 hours. Very high concentrations of cefazolin are also found in the urine.

AB  - The structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding Bacillus circulans, Diplococcus (Streptococcus) pneumoniae, Streptococcus salivarius, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Herella vaginacola (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus), and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were studied by electron microscopy. A modified ruthenium red staining procedure was used to examine the fine structure of capsule and slime. Freeze-etching and critical-point drying were used to examine the quantity of unaltered exocellular material. Comparative data demonstrate that fibrillar extracellular polymer surrounding B. circulans, D. pneumoniae, and K. pneumoniae is capsule (cell wall attached) which is characteristic of the producing organism. Capsular polymer generally appeared fibrillar, although globular polymer consisted of capsular subunits bound to S. salivarius and H. vaginacola. Exocellular slime was present about S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and A. tumefaciens.

The animals became ill earlier than the controls and the respiratory LD50 for the hyperbaric mice was about 50% smaller than for controls under ambient conditions. Furthermore, hyperbaricity induced an acute depression in phagocytic activity and a marked elevation in the circulating levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine.

AB  - Sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside antibiotic which is produced by Micromonospora myoensis, was studied against 565 clinical isolates of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci. With the exception of Serratia marcescens, over 90% of isolates of gram-negative bacilli were inhibited by 1.56 mug/ml or less of sisomicin. Sisomicin was slightly more active than gentamicin and tobramycin aganist isolates of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella spp. It was substantially more active than butirosin and kanamycin against all gram-negative bacilli. Isolates of gram-negative bacilli which were resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin were also resistant to sisomicin. Most of these isolates were sensitive to amikacin.
TI  - In vitro bacteriological study of a new antibiotic substance: sisomicin.
AB  - Effects of a new antimicrobial agent sisomicin on microorganisms isolated from pathologic material (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus pyogenes-B, Citrobacter Freundii) were studied. The results obtained were compared with another two aminoglycoside antibiotics - gentamicin and tobramycin. All three antibiotics were found to be very effective in vitro; their effect was enhanced by addition of an antibiotic of the penicillin group (carbenicillin, suncillin) or an antibiotic of the tetracyklin series (oxytetracyklin, doxycyklin). All three preparations were tested on 26 Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. Tobramycin inhibited growth of 22 strains and thus presented the highest level of efficiency among these deoxystreptamin preparations.
TI  - [Postoperative bacterial endocarditis after cardiac prosthesis (author's transl)].
AB  - The infection of an endocardial prosthesis, either valvular or septal patch, is a frequent and dangerous post-operative complication. Eleven patients having postoperative endocarditis (9 on valve prosthesis and 2 on ventricular septal patch) are the subject of this paper. Six of the 7 infected "early" had Gram-negative bacteria in the blood cultures, while staphylococus aureus, streptococcus viridans and klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for 3 of the 4 "late" infections. In 2 patients, one "early" and one "late" the causative bacteria were not identified. The definite prevalence of Gram-negative flora in post-operative endocarditis may have been facilitated by the routine use of antibiotics after open-heart surgery. Three of the 11 patients survived, one after replacement of the infected prosthesis and two after prolonged specific antibiotic treatment. On the basic of this experience, compared with other written reports, the authors propose to treat postoperative endocarditis medically for approximately 5 weeks, with full doses of specific antibiotics, reserving for surgical treatment only the cases of prosthetic malfunction, left atrial thrombosis, peripheral embolization and in those patients where the medical treatment fails.
TI  - [Synthetic medium for testing of susceptibility. II. Susceptibility of bacteria to sulphonamides (author's transl)].
AB  - A comparative study of 9 media for testing the susceptibility of bacteria to 7 sulphonamides has been carried out. The evaluated culture-media included 4 "Mueller Hinton" media (MH), 4 others based on the formula of the "Diagnostic Sensitivity Test" agar base (D.S.T.) and a "Synthetic Medium" (SM) which has been developed in our laboratory. MH and D.S.T. culture-media have been supplied by 4 manufacturing companies in Europe and USA. A total number of 21 bacterial cultures have been employed. The included species belong to the gram negative genera Citrobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Proteus, Salmonella, Serratia and Shigella, and to the gram positive genus Streptococcus. Sulphafurazole, sulphasomidine, sulphamethoxazole, sulphamethoxypyridazine, sulphadimethoxine, sulphaphenazole and sulphamethoxydiazine have been investigated. SM proved to be clearly superior to the other 8 culture-media mentioned above. Just one MH afforded good results. The 3 other MH and 2 D.S.T. media were not quite satisfactory. The two remaining D.S.T. media were unsuitable. Moreover, the activity of the tested sulphonamides was not equally high against the concerned bacteria. The author discussed the significance of the inoculum-size and of competitive and noncompetitive sulphonamide-antagonists in commercial culture-media and the difficulties they raise by the interpretation of the results.

Appearance of antibodies of this type was related to duration of immunization, but not related to the type of antigen used. The experimental results were explained as a result of altered antigenic properties of antibodies following reaction with homologous antigen.

TI  - Cephacetrile, a new cephalosporin: in vitro, pharmacological and clinical evaluation.
AB  - Cephacetrile, a parenteral cephalosporin, was evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity, clinical pharmacology and effectiveness in the treatment of severe infections. The antibacterial activity against 187 isolates was determined by an agar-dilution technique. The MICs were 0.06 to 0.5 mug/ml for Group A Streptococcus, D. pneumoniae, and Staph. aureus, 4-6 mug/ml for E. coli and Klebsiella-Enterobacter 8-32 mug/ml for Pr. mirabilis and more than 500 mug/ml for Ps. aeruginosa. A few strains of Klebsiella and E. coli had MICs of more than 125 mcg/ml. Serum levels after 0.5 and 1 g of i.m. cephacetrile were respectively 14.6 and 18.6 mug/ml after 1 hr, and 1.5 and 2.5 mug/ml after 6 hr. Serum levels after i.v. infusion of 0.5 and 1 g were respectively 16 and 25 mug/ml after 1 hr., and 1 and 2 mug/ml after 6 hr. Urine levels after 0.5 and 1 g i.m. cephacetrile were respectively 500 and 650 mug/ml in the 0-3 hr period, and 250 and 300 mug/ml in the 3-6 hr period. Renal clearance was 166 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2; renal excretion was about 20% of the dose 6 hr after i.m. injection. Cephacetrile was well tolerated when administered i.m. with lidocaine. Mild phlebitis occurred sometimes after i.v. infusions. The clinical response, evaluated in 36 patients with severe systemic, respiratory and urinary infections, was good in all but two cases.

AB  - When tested on Wellcotest (sensitivity test agar, Wellcome) supplemented with lysed horse blood, 59 clinical isolates of beta-haemolytic streptococci, belonging to several serological groups, are all sensitive to sulphamethoxazole, to trimethoprim, and to cotrimoxazole. The results obtained on diagnostic sensitivity test agar (Oxoid) containing lysed horse blood are comparable. When Mueller Hinton agar (Difco) is used, some of these strains are called resistant: this is especially true in the case of sulphamethoxazole.Furthermore, on Mueller Hinton agar, even supplemented with lysed blood, discrepancies between diameters of inhibition zone and MIC values exist for the three drugs tested, strains with a low MIC being considered resistant by the disc method. Such disagreements are not observed with non-streptococcal control strains.

AB  - Nineteen patients with pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus  aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Escherichia coli were treated with 4 to 18 g of cephapirin daily. There were three treatment failures. One patient each with pneumonia due to E. coli or S. pneumoniae died despite apparent eradication of the pathogen. Lobar pneumonia due to K. pneumoniae progressed during therapy in a third patient to lung gangrene, necessitating pneumonectomy. Five additional patients with pneumococcal pericarditis or septic bursitis, empyema, cannula-associated bacteremia, and thoractomy wound infection due to S. aureus were cured. All isolates of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and group A Streptococcus were inhibited by 0.8 mug of cephapirin per ml; minimal inhibitory concentrations of cephalothin were similar. Ninety percent of K. pneumoniae, 85% of Proteus mirabilis, 73% of E. coli, and 30% of Enterobacter were inhibited by 12.5 mug cephapirin per ml. All isolates of Pseudomonas, Serratia and indole-positive Proteus had a cephapirin minimal inhibitory concentration of [Formula: see text] 100 mug/mg. Serum concentrations after intravenous and intramuscular injection were similar to those reported for cephalothin. The intramuscular injections were moderately painful, and intravenous infusions caused phlebitis in three of nine patients treated with doses up to 18 g per day. Cephapirin appears comparable to cephalothin in vitro and is an effective agent in treatment of infection due to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae.
TI  - New antimicrobial nitrofuran, trans-5-amino-3-[2-(5-nitro-2-furyl)vinyl]-delta2-1,2,4-oxadiazole: antimicrobial efficacy in mice, rats, and guinea pigs.
AB  - A new antimicrobial nitrofuran designated SQ 18,506 showed some therapeutic activity when administered orally to mice infected with Escherichia coli, Salmonella schottmuelleri, Shigella flexneri, or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Animals infected parenterally with Streptococcus pyogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Candida albicans, or topically with Trichophyton mentagrophytes, did not respond to therapy with the drug at the dosage levels used. The compound was as effective as metronidazole in the topical treatment of experimental trichomonal infections in mice and in guinea pigs and as effective as nystatin, candicidin, or a sulfanilamide-aminacrine hydrochloride cream in the treatment of a candidal vaginal infection in rats. The chemotherapeutic efficacy of SQ 18,506 in experimental vaginitis caused by Escherichia coli in the rat surpassed that shown by four commercial products available for the treatment of bacterial vaginitis.
TI  - Pulmonary infection due to disruption of the pharyngeal bacterial flora by antibiotics in hamsters.
AB  - An animal model was used to determine the effect of oxacillin on the pharyngeal bacterial flora and the relationship of this flora to pneumonia. The pharyngeal bacterial flora of 68 healthy Golden Syrian hamsters was determined. A quantitative comparison between Streptococci and Escherichia, Proteus, Klebsiella and Enterobacter from 70 hamsters was made before and at 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after oxacillin administration. Lung cultures were positive in 22 of 25 hamsters, yielding K pneumoniae type 1 most frequently. Lung histology from 25 hamsters revealed bronchopneumonia. Intestinal postmortem cultures of treated and untreated animals were similar. The importance of throat cultures in diagnosing pneumonia and the value of the hamster model to study the effect of other antibiotics on the temporary flora are demonstrated.

AB  - The relative amount of extracellular polymer which remains about Azotobacter vinelandii, Zoogloea ramigera, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Diplococcus pneumoniae after critical-point drying was studied by electron microscopy. The results obtained with this technique are compared to those obtained with methods that illustrate extracellular polymer, such as freeze-etching and ruthenium red staining. Comparative results indicate critical-point drying to be a rapid, reliable method for the determination of capsule-like polymer surrounding bacterial cells. In addition, critical-point drying can be used to observe morphogenetic changes, such as vesicle production.
TI  - Occurrence of potential pathogens in water containing ornamental fishes.
AB  - The bacterial population of the water supplied with ornamental fish purchased from retail outlets was examined qualitatively and quantitatively. As many as 10(9) viable aerobic organisms per 100 ml were present, with fecal coliform counts as high as 10(5) per 100 ml. Citrobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio were isolated from 75% or more of the samples, whereas Aeromonas, Alcaligenes, Enterobacter, Flavobacterium, and Streptococcus were isolated from 45 to 65% of the samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Edwardsiella tarda, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were also isolated.
TI  - Infection and immunoglobulin concentrations in Chediak-Higashi mice.
AB  - The Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) has been reported in man, cattle, mink, and mice. CHS humans and cattle have an increased incidence of pyogenic infections, whereas CHS mink are more susceptible to Aleutian disease. Age- and sex-matched groups of CHS mice (mutant strain) and C57 Bl/6N (parent strain) were challenged with Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus intravenously and Streptococcus pneumoniae intraperitoneally. A significant increase (P < 0.001) in mortality rate for the CHS mice was demonstrated with all five challenge organisms. Heterozygous mice challenged with C. albicans had a mortality rate essentially the same as C57 Bl/6N mice. The serum immunoglobulin concentrations of CHS mice were found to be the same or greater than the control or heterozygous mice. CHS mice have an increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections, which is not due to immunoglobulin deficiency. These mice may provide a useful laboratory model for the study of increased susceptibility to infection.

AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  - Abolition of swarming of Proteus by p-nitrophenyl glycerin: application to blood  agar media.
AB  - Comparative plate counts were made of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes growing on blood agar supplemented with individual chemicals to abolish the swarming of Proteus. B-phenylethanol, sodium azide, and p-nitrophenyl glycerin (PNPG) were used as anti-swarm agents. Each anti-swarm agent effectively abolished swarming for 24 h, but azide failed to control swarming for longer periods of incubation. In addition, azide displayed growth inhibition towards the staphylococci and streptococci resulting in no hemolysis and reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci. Phenylethanol showed reduced viable cell numbers with the streptococci and unreliable hemolytic reactions. At 0.1 to 0.3 mM, PNPG proved to be a superior anti-swarm agent in that it showed no growth inhibition and allowed normal hemolysis, but abolished swarming for extended periods of time. When laboratory strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae were screened on a blood agar medium containing 0.1 mm PNPG, they displayed similar growth and hemolytic characteristics to the identical medium without PNPG.

TI  - Clinical and in vitro evaluation of cefazolin, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - Cefazolin sodium, a cephalosporin for parenteral use, was evaluated in vitro and  in 26 patients. Cefazolin had activity equivalent to cephalothin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Proteus mirabilis. Cefazolin was four- to eightfold more active against Escherichia coli and slightly more active against Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas cephalothin was slightly more active against indole-positive Proteus species. After a 500-mg dose of cefazolin intramuscularly, peak concentrations in the serum were high enough to inhibit all strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, group A streptococci, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis, as well as 60% of strains of Proteus species other than P. mirabilis. All of 26 patients (18 with pneumonia, 6 with urinary tract infection, and 2 with skin infections) responded clinically and bacteriologically to cefazolin therapy. There were no major side effects of therapy, and no patient complained of pain at the site of intramuscular injection. Cefazolin is an effective cephalosporin which can be used intramuscularly for therapy of serious bacterial infections. Its major advantages over other cephalosporins are higher, more sustained concentrations in the blood and apparent lack of pain on intramuscular injection.
TI  - Microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, BL-S 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.

AB  - The activity of methacycline against microbial L-forms and their parent bacteria  was compared with that of oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, tetracycline, and demethylchlortetracycline, as well as with that of 22 other antibiotics which included examples of major groups of antibiotics. The L-forms and bacteria used were Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (three strains), Proteus mirabilis (two strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (two strains), Sarcina flava, Serratia marcescens, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The five tetracyclines had similar activities and were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms, except that the bacterial form of S. flava was more susceptible than the L-form. In general, other antibiotics (except the penicillins) were more active against L-forms than bacterial forms. There were certain exceptions where the bacterial form was more susceptible than the L-form. These included the effect of polymyxin B and colistin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and P. mirabilis, and the effect of gentamicin on P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. flava, and S. marcescens.

AB  - Butirosin is a new aminoglycosidic antibiotic complex which has broad gram-negative and gram-positive inhibitory antibacterial activity, as well as some bactericidal properties. Significantly susceptible bacteria include strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, and pathogenic gram-negative species such as Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri and S. sonnei. Good activity by parenteral dosing was obtained in various acute mouse infections. Butirosin is especially interesting because of its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro, including gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates, and in experimental mouse infections at relatively low doses.

TI  - Amoxycillin: a new semi-synthetic penicillin.
AB  - Amoxycillin (alpha-amino-p-hydroxybenzylpenicillin) is a new semi-synthetic penicillin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity similar to that of ampicillin. Penicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococci, streptococci, and pneumococci were sensitive to concentrations of 0.1 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Strains of Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited by a level of 0.5 mug/ml, and most strains of Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella species, and Streptococcus faecalis were sensitive to a concentration of 5 mug or less of amoxycillin/ml. Penicillinase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indole-positive Proteus, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter were insensitive to amoxycillin. The new penicillin was bactericidal in activity, as with other penicillins, and its antibacterial activity was not reduced in the presence of serum. After oral administration to volunteer subjects amoxycillin produced serum concentrations twice as high as those obtained with similar doses of ampicillin, and the penicillin was recovered unchanged in high concentrations in the urine. The absorption of amoxycillin was not greatly influenced by food, and administration of probenecid resulted in increased and more prolonged concentrations of amoxycillin in serum.

AB  - 7-[alpha-(1-Methyl-4-pyridiniothio)-acetamido] cephalosporanic acid, referred to  herein as BL-S 217, is a new broad-spectrum semisynthetic cephalosporin that offers several advantages over cephalothin. A comparison of the activity in vitro of these antibiotics indicates that BL-S 217 is about eightfold more effective against Streptococcus pyogenes and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Against gram-negative bacteria, BL-S 217 possesses a broader antibacterial spectrum than cephalothin, particularly against members of the Enterobacteriaceae family; e.g., BL-S 217 inhibited over 20% more strains of both Escherichia coli and Klebsiella than cephalothin and also showed some advantage in tests against Salmonella and Enterobacter. Overall, of 208 strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested, 172 were susceptible to BL-S 217 compared to 149 for cephalothin. BL-S 217 was less bound to human serum proteins than cephalothin and gave higher peak blood levels in mice after intramuscular administration. The LD(50) of BL-S 217 in mice after subcutaneous administration was in excess of 4,000 mg/kg. When administered by the same route to mice experimentally infected with cephalothin-sensitive bacterial strains, this new cephalosporin was 20 times more effective than cephalothin in S. pyogenes and D. pneumoniae infections and 3 to 4 times more efficacious in an E. coli infection. Its therapeutic efficacy was comparable to that of cephalothin in infections produced by strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis.

AB  - Serum bacteriostasis of Staphylococcus aureus was characterized quantitatively and quantitatively. Bacteriostasis was proportional to the concentration of serum. Reproducibility was good; freezing and thawing did not materially affect the end point. Four of six different strains, including the propagating S. aureus strain for phage 73 which does not produce coagulase, were susceptible to serum bacteriostasis in similar titers; two were not susceptible at all. All six strains were effective inhibitors of bacteriostasis. Active and inactive coagulase were also inhibitors. In contrast to sensitive S. aureus, S. epidermidis and Streptococcus salivarius were not uniformly susceptible to bacteriostasis by different serums. Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella montevideo, S. zymogenes, and Diplococcus pneumoniae were not susceptible. Among gram-positive bacteria, only D. pneumoniae inhibited S. aureus bacteriostasis. Agglutinins of S. aureus and nonspecific substances such as lysozyme, beta-lysin, C-reactive protein, and transferrin were not responsible for S. aureus serum bacteriostasis. After diethylaminoethyl column fractionation of serum, the bacteriostatic principle was eluted in proximity to blood group antibody; immunoglobulins A, G, and M appeared to be present in bacteriostatic fractions. It is suggested that S. aureus bacteriostasis by serum is due to natural antibody and that inhibitory reactions with pneumococci and coagulase are due to common antigens.
TI  - Vitamin B12 uptake by intestinal microorganisms: mechanism and relevance to syndromes of intestinal bacterial overgrowth.
AB  - The mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. Bacterial uptake of vitamin B(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. A primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), pH dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide. Protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all B(12) uptake. This primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. Second stage uptake was slower, pH and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or N-ethyl-maleimide. This phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of B(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. Although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for B(12), all organisms except Streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. Two Gram-positive organisms. Bacillus subtilis and Group A streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin B(12) uptake values; Gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. Binding constants (K(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)M for B. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)M for Klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the Km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)M). Competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin B(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. These observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous B(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin B(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

Coumermycin also showed good activity against group A streptococci and pneumococci, moderate activity against Escherichia coli, indole-positive Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and poor activity against Klebsiella-Enterobacter and enterococci. Against P. mirabilis, however, coumermycin activity was almost equal to that of ampicillin. The new antibiotic was further found to be greatly reduced in activity in the presence of plasma, but its minimal inhibitory concentration was not greatly affected by inoculum size. Coumermycin was found to be bacteriostatic in its action, and resistance to it developed slowly. Also, cross-resistance was present with novobiocin but absent with ampicillin or minocycline.

AB  - More than 500 bacteria isolated from patient material were tested against carbenicillin (disodium alpha-carboxybenzylpenicillin) by diffusion and dilution modalities. The same bacteria, which included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Aerobacter-Enterobacter group, various species of Proteus, Staphylococcus aureus and epiddermidis, enterococci, pneumococci, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc., were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics commonly used with special emphasis on ampicillin and cephalothin. The responses of pyocine-typed P. aeruginosa were the most remarkable. The majority of these bacteria displayed susceptibility to carbenicillin by both the dilution and the diffusion techniques. The concentrations of this antibiotic used in the laboratory were of the same order of magnitude as that of the other drugs. The laboratory behavior of the other bacteria, toward this new semisynthetic penicillin derivative approximated their response to ampicillin and cephalothin.

TI  - Quantitation of microorganisms in sputum.
AB  - A method of quantitating microbial cultures of homogenized sputum has been devised. Possible application of this method to the problem of determining the etiologic agent of lower-respiratory-tract infections has been studied to determine its usefulness as a guide in the management of these infections. Specimens were liquefied by using an equal volume of 2% N-acetyl-L-cysteine. The liquefied sputum suspension was serially diluted to 10(-1), 10(-3), 10(-5), and 10(-7). These dilutions were plated on appropriate media by using an 0.01-ml calibrated loop; they were incubated and examined by standard diagnostic methods. Quantitation of fresh sputum from patients with pneumonia prior to antimicrobial therapy revealed that probable pathogens were present in populations of 10(7) organisms/ml or greater. Normal oropharyngeal flora did not occur in these numbers before therapy. Comparison of microbial counts on fresh and aged sputum showed that it is necessary to use only fresh specimens, since multiplication or death alters both quantitative and qualitative findings. Proper collection and quantitative culturing of homogenized sputum provided information more directly applicable to patient management than did qualitative routine methods. Not only was the recognition of the probable pathogenic organism in pneumonia patients improved, but serial quantitative cultures were particularly useful in recognizing the emergence of superinfections and in evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  - Antipseudomonal activity of alpha-sulfoaminopenicillins.
AB  - A series of penicillins characterized by the presence of a sulfoamino or a modified sulfoamino group in the side chain was subjected to in vitro antimicrobial screening tests. Although the most potent members of the series were less active than benzylpenicillin against gram-positive bacteria and comparably active against most gram-negative bacteria, they were, on the average, 8 to 16 times more effective against strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In other comparative laboratory tests against P. aeruginosa, these compounds were about as active as carbenicillin and four to eight times more active than ampicillin. An examination of structure-activity relationships indicated that maximal potency was obtained with penicillins having an alpha-(aromatic or heteroaromatic)-alpha-sulfoaminoacetamido side chain. The compound with an alpha-phenyl group was comparable in activity to those having an alpha-(2- or 3-thienyl) group, whereas any modification in position or structure of the alpha-sulfoamino group reduced activity. Results of studies with a cell-free P. aeruginosa beta-lactamase suggest that the marked inhibitory effects of alpha-sulfoamino penicillins for P. aeruginosa can be attributed, at least in part, to their high degree of resistance to this enzyme. Some derivatives, however, had weak antipseudomonal activity, despite possessing a high degree of beta-lactamase resistance.

AB  - Concentrations of cephalexin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) in serum and urine were determined in normal volunteers and patients. The in vitro antibacterial activity was also studied. All strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 3.1 mug/ml. Of the Staphylococcus aureus strains, 88% were inhibited by 6.3 mug/ml, and 12.5 mug/ml was inhibitory for all S. aureus, 80% of Escherichia coli, 72% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter, and 56% of Proteus mirabilis strains. About 90 to 96% of E. coli, Klebsiella Aerobacter, and P. mirabilis strains were inhibited by 25 mug of cephalexin per ml. Pseudomonas and indole-positive Proteus strains proved to be quite resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin was well absorbed after oral administration. A peak serum concentration of cephalexin of at least 5 mug/ml was achieved in each volunteer with 250 and 500-mg doses. A mean peak serum concentration of 7.7 mug/ml was achieved with 250-mg doses; 12.3mug/ml was achieved with 500-mg doses of antibiotic. Food did not interfere with absorption. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Over 90% of the administered dose was excreted in the urine within 6 hr. The mean peak serum concentration of cephalexin after an oral dose of 500 mg was adequate to inhibit all group A streptococci, D. pneumoniae, and S. aureus, 85% of E. coli, and about 40 to 75% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter and P. mirabilis strains. Levels of cephalexin in urine were adequate to inhibit over 90% of E. coli, and P. mirabilis and 80 to 96% of Klebsiella-Aerobacter strains.

TI  - Cephalexin and cephaloglycin activity in vitro and absorption and urinary excretion of single oral doses in normal young adults.
AB  - A large number of recently isolated bacterial pathogens were tested for susceptibility to cephalexin and cephaloglycin by the replica inoculating method. Strains of group A hemolytic streptococci, viridans (alpha and gamma) streptococci, pneumococci, gonococci, meningococci, and penicillin G-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus were all moderately to highly susceptible to both of these cephalosporin analogues, nearly all of the strains being two to eight (median four) times more susceptible to cephaloglycin than to cephalexin. The penicillin G-resistant, penicillinase-producing strains of S. aureus varied in their susceptibility; many were moderately resistant to both analogues, particularly to cephalexin. Strains of enterococci, Haemophilus influenzae, and most of the common gram-negative bacilli were moderately to highly resistant. Reducing the size of the inoculum had variable effects on inhibition by these drugs, depending on the species or strain. The activity of cephalexin was very little affected by pH of the medium within the clinical range or by incubation at 37 C in broth for up to 24 hr. In contrast, cephaloglycin in broth deteriorated rapidly at 37 C, and its activity was markedly reduced in alkaline medium. Both cephalexin and cephaloglycin were rapidly absorbed and excreted into the urine after single oral doses of 500 mg. Much higher levels were achieved and sustained with the former. Absorption of both analogues was delayed when taken with food, and the levels in the serum were significantly higher and better sustained when probenecid was also given. Very high concentrations of cephalexin were excreted into the urine during the first 4 hr, and the levels were still high in the 4- to 8-hr collection. The concentrations of cephaloglycin in the urine at these times were much lower. An average of 80 to 93% of the dose of cephalexin and 25 to 30% of the cephaloglycin were accounted for as active drug in the urine collected in 8 hr. Both analogues were well tolerated.

TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
TI  - Effects of indomethacin on acute, subacute, and latent infections in mice and rats.
AB  - The comparative effect of indomethacin and hydrocortisone on the resistance of mice or rats to various acute, subacute, and latent bacterial infections was investigated. Large daily doses of indomethacin and hydrocortisone administered to mice challenged with bacterial pathogens, including Klebsiella pneumoniae AD, Salmonella schottmuelleri 3010, Staphylococcus aureus (Smith), Streptococcus pyogenes C203, Salmonella pullorum #2, Proteus vulgaris 1810, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2616, revealed that in essentially all of these acute infections, the mortality of the infected mice treated with indomethacin was essentially identical to that found in the infected controls. In contrast, hydrocortisone often lowered the resistance of mice to these acute infections. In a more chronic bacterial infection due to Corynebacterium kutscheri, hydrocortisone produced striking deleterious effects on resistance, whereas indomethacin administration in doses approaching the maximal tolerated level caused no observable adverse effects on host resistance. Indomethacin fed continuously to rats for 80 days, at maximal tolerated levels, caused no observable adverse effects on the host-parasite relationship of rats which were shown to harbor various latent infections. Hydrocortisone administration, however, lowered the resistance of rats as evidenced by increased mortality related directly to extensive bacterial infection. Insofar as infection is concerned, indomethacin behaved like other nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin and phenylbutazone.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  - Serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin C) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. The in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. All strains of group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) and Diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Eighty per cent of the Staphylococcus aureus strains and about 50% of the Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis strains were inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. Klebsiella-Aerobacter species were more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. When single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. A full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. Probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. Serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. The peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group A streptococci and D. pneumoniae. Many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of S. aureus, E. coli, and P. mirabilis. Urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the E. coli and P. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of Klebsiella-Aerobacter.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  - Norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. Turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. The organisms tested included Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus conglomeratus, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus faecalis, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexnerii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Proteus vulgaris. Bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in Tryptic Soy Broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. The bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. Mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on S. aureus. However, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. Enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. Progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. In vivo studies indicated that female, adult New Zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with S. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. The protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. Thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. When the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. During the 1st day after infection with S. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

Those bacteria which responded with equivocal zones of inhibition about the tetracycline compounds were tested by the tube dilution technique. Staphylococci and enterococci consistently displayed greater in vitro susceptibility to doxycycline than to tetracycline or demethylchlortetracycline.

Caffeine was more antibacterial than theophylline, and the latter more than theobromine. Caffeine citrate exhibited greater inhibitory effect than did pure caffeine. The effect was both bacteriostatic and bactericidal against susceptible organisms. The susceptibility of organisms to xanthines differed greatly even in related species. The morphology of Aerobacter aerogenes and A. cloacae was affected under the influence of caffeine; filamentation of cells followed sublethal doses. Potentiation was seen with antibiotics and caffeine; resistant strains were killed with a lower dose of drug in the presence of caffeine. This potentiating effect was pronounced with the tetracyclines; with streptomycin, the effect was the contrary.
TI  - IN VITRO AND IN VIVO LABORATORY EVALUATION OF CEPHALOGLYCIN AND CEPHALORIDINE.
AB  - Two new antibiotics, structurally related to cephalothin, have been given the generic names cephaloglycin and cephaloridine. Cephaloglycin is the dipolar ion of 7-(d-alpha-aminophenylacetamido)-cephalosporanic acid. Cephaloridine is 7-[alpha-(2-thiophene)acetamido]-3-(1-pyridylmethyl)-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid betaine. These new compounds were evaluated simultaneously. The broad spectrum of activity observed in vitro and in vivo with both antibiotics, the good oral absorption obtained with cephaloglycin, and the stability of cephaloridine are emphasized. The data suggest that both antibiotics merit clinical trial in humans.

AB  - Hedgecock, Loyd W. (Veterans Administration Hsopital, St. Louis, Mo.). Resistance-enhancing activity of culture filtrates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. J. Bacteriol. 88:1349-1355. 1964.-It was demonstrated that filtrates of cultures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exhibit resistance-enhancing activity against infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Diplococcus pneumoniae. Resistance was demonstrable when the culture filtrate was injected 3 hr prior to challenge with K. pneumoniae, and reached the highest level when injected 24 hr before challenge. Protection was maximal when the filtrate and challenging organisms were injected by the same route. After infection with K. pneumoniae, the bacterial titers in the tissues of filtrate-treated animals were significantly lower than those of untreated susceptible controls. Mice injected with the filtrate 24 hr previously demonstrated significantly increased rates of clearance of injected carbon from the blood. In examination of a variety of mycobacteria, resistance-enhancing activity was found only in culture-filtrates of pathogenic mycobacteria, the highest concentration occurring in filtrates of virulent organisms. The injection of a relatively large amount of phenol-killed cells of all of the mycobacteria examined enhanced resistance to infection with K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Horse blood agar containing polymyxin B sulphate, neomycin sulphate, and fusidic  acid inhibited the growth of Staph. aureus, Ps. pyocyanea, Proteus mirabilis, E. coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but allowed good growth of, and haemolysis by, Str. pyogenes. In a comparison with blood agar, blood 4% agar, and gentian violet blood agar, the selective medium (P.N.F.) yielded a significantly higher proportion of streptococci than the other media, both by aerobic and by anaerobic culture, from burn swab extracts deliberately contaminated with Str. pyogenes; P.N.F. culture was more effective with dilute than with heavy inocula of Str. pyogenes, allowing from three to seven times as many recoveries of Str. pyogenes from swabs contaminated with 10(-3) dilution of streptococcal cultures than cultures of the same material on the other media. Haemolytic streptococci of groups A, C, D, G, and others were isolated by aerobic culture from burns in a consecutive series of 1,277 swabs more often on P.N.F. medium than on blood 4% agar. Viable counts of 12 strains (including 11 different serological types) of Str. pyogenes showed some reduction in the numbers of colonies compared with counts on blood agar, and some strains grew more slowly on P.N.F. medium. These limitations, however, were offset and outweighed by the higher final yield of streptococci on the selective medium.

AB  - The pharmacology and chemotherapy of a new penicillin, 6[D(-)-alpha-aminophenylacetamido] penicillanic acid, are described. It is non-toxic, is absorbed orally and is distributed throughout the body in a manner similar to other penicillins. It is eliminated unchanged from the body in high concentrations in the bile and urine. Almost all of the antibiotic can be accounted for in the urine and intestinal contents 2 hr after intramuscular administration but not after oral administration. It is concluded that the antibiotic is not metabolized within the body. Studies with infected animals show that it is as effective as the existing oral penicillins against Staphylococcus pyogenes Smith (penicillin sensitive), Streptococcus pyogenes Group A and Diplococcus pneumoniae. It is ineffective against penicillin-resistant Staphylococci. When tested in mice infected with the gram-negative organisms, Salmonella tryphimurium and Klebsiella pneumoniae, it was considerably more active than tetracycline and chloramphenicol.
