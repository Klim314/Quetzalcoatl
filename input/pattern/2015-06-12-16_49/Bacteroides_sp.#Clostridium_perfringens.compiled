TI  - Modulation of small intestinal homeostasis along with its microflora during acclimatization at simulated hypobaric hypoxia.
AB  - At high altitude (HA) hypobaric hypoxic environment manifested several pathophysiological consequences of which gastrointestinal (GI) disorder are very common phenomena. To explore the most possible clue behind this disorder intestinal flora, the major player of the GI functions, were subjected following simulated hypobaric hypoxic treatment in model animal. For this, male albino rats were exposed to 55 kPa (approximately 4872.9 m) air pressure consecutively for 30 days for 8 h/day and its small intestinal microflora, their secreted digestive enzymes and stress induced marker protein were investigated of the luminal epithelia. It was observed that population density of total aerobes significantly decreased, but the quantity of total anaerobes and Escherichia coli increased significantly after 30 days of hypoxic stress. The population density of strict anaerobes like Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Lactobacillus sp. and obligate anaerobes like Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus sp. were expanded along with their positive growth direction index (GDI). In relation to the huge multiplication of anaerobes the amount of gas formation as well as content of IgA and IgG increased in duration dependent manner. The activity of some luminal enzymes from microbial origin like a-amylase, gluco-amylase, proteinase, alkaline phosphatase and beta-glucuronidase were also elevated in hypoxic condition. Besides, hypoxia induced in formation of malondialdehyde along with significant attenuation of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activity and lowered GSH/GSSG pool in the intestinal epithelia. Histological study revealed disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier with higher infiltration of lymphocytes in lamina propia and atrophic structure. It can be concluded that hypoxia at HA modified GI microbial imprint and subsequently causes epithelial barrier dysfunction which may relate to the small intestinal dysfunction at HA.

TI  - Effect of tea phenolics and their aromatic fecal bacterial metabolites on intestinal microbiota.
AB  - Tea is rich in polyphenols and other phenolics that have been widely reported to  have beneficial health effects. However, dietary polyphenols are not completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and are metabolized by the gut microflora so that they and their metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. In this study, we investigated the influence of the phenolic components of a tea extract and their aromatic metabolites upon bacterial growth. Fecal homogenates containing bacteria significantly catalyzed tea phenolics, including epicatechin, catechin, 3-O-methyl gallic acid, gallic acid and caffeic acid to generate aromatic metabolites dependent on bacterial species. Different strains of intestinal bacteria had varying degrees of growth sensitivity to tea phenolics and metabolites. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and Bacteroides spp. was significantly repressed by tea phenolics and their derivatives, while commensal anaerobes like Clostridium spp., Bifidobacterium spp. and probiotics such as Lactobacillus sp. were less severely affected. This indicates that tea phenolics exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population, probably by acting as metabolic prebiotics. Our observations provide further evidence for the importance of colonic bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of phenolics in human health and disease. The bioactivity of different phenolics may play an important role in the maintenance of gastrointestinal health.
TI  - Sulfate-reducing bacteria colonize pouches formed for ulcerative colitis but not  for familial adenomatous polyposis.
AB  - PURPOSE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis remains the "gold standard" in surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Pouchitis occurs mainly in patients with a background of ulcerative colitis, although the reasons for this are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize differences in pouch bacterial populations between ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous pouches. METHODS: After ethical approval was obtained, fresh stool samples were collected from patients with ulcerative colitis pouches (n = 10), familial adenomatous polyposis (n = 7) pouches, and ulcerative colitis ileostomies (n = 8). Quantitative measurements of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were performed. RESULTS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated from 80 percent (n = 8) of ulcerative colitis pouches. Sulfate-reducing bacteria were absent from familial adenomatous polyposis pouches and also from ulcerative colitis ileostomy effluent. Pouch Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, and Clostridium perfringens counts were increased relative to ileostomy counts in patients with ulcerative colitis. Total pouch enterococci and coliform counts were also increased relative to ileostomy levels. There were no significant quantitative or qualitative differences between pouch types when these bacteria were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Sulfate-reducing bacteria are exclusive to patients with a background of ulcerative colitis. Not all ulcerative colitis pouches harbor sulfate-reducing bacteria because two ulcerative colitis pouches in this study were free of the latter. They are not present in familial adenomatous polyposis pouches or in ileostomy effluent collected from patients with ulcerative colitis. Total bacterial counts increase in ulcerative colitis pouches after stoma closure. Levels of Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides sp, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, and coliforms were similar in both pouch groups. Because sulfate-reducing bacteria are specific to ulcerative colitis pouches, they may play a role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis.
TI  - Sequence analysis of bacterial DNA in the colon and stomach of the Tyrolean Iceman.
AB  - The male human body found in an Alpine glacier on September 19, 1991 ("Tyrolean Iceman") has, for the first time in history, given scientists a chance to perform detailed anatomical, histological, and molecular investigations on the organs of a person from the Neolithic Age (5350-5100 B.P.). In the present study, tissue samples aseptically taken from the stomach and the colon of the mummy were utilized for DNA extraction, and the DNA was PCR-amplified, using primer pairs designed to bind to fragments of the 16s ribosomal RNA gene (16s rDNA) of a broad range of bacteria. The PCR products were cloned in plasmid vectors, and the recombinant clones (amplicons) were sequenced. The sequence data were finally used for scanning data libraries containing the corresponding sequences of present-day bacteria, to infer the putative ecophysiology of the ancient ones. The same procedure was repeated on some fragments of grass from the clothing found near the corpse. These fragments were taken as a control of the microbiological situation of the glacier. The results show that the flora of the Iceman's stomach is entirely composed of Burkholderia pickettii, an organism commonly found in aquatic habitats. The colon, on the other hand, contains several members of the fecal flora of humans, such as Clostridium perfringens, C. ghonii, C. sordellii, Eubacterium tenue, and Bacteroides sp. The Iceman's colon, however, was found to contain, rather unexpectedly, also some members of the genus Vibrio. The results are discussed in light of what is known about the preservation of microbial DNA at the Iceman's site and of previous parasitological studies performed on the Iceman himself and on human coprolites.
TI  - The intestinal microflora during the first weeks of life.
AB  - Bacterial colonization of the neonatal gastrointestinal tract begins during birth when the neonate comes into contact with the maternal cervical and vaginal flora. In infants delivered by Caesarean section, bacteria colonizing the neonate gastrointestinal tract are provided by the environment. The first bacteria encountered in the majority of healthy infants, are facultative anaerobes, which remain predominant during the first 2 weeks of life. Among them, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus were the genera most commonly isolated from the newborn faecal flora at birth. Facultative anaerobic bacteria are followed closely by Bifidobacterium sp. Clostridium perfringens is present within 2 days with an increase incidence in newborns delivered by a Caesarean section. Clostridium perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of other anaerobic putrefactive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp. The impact of Caesarean section and the period and quality of hospitalization are mainly implicated in changes of the normal newborn flora. Feeding seems to modulate the colonization pattern. In humans, breast milk plays a role in passive immunization of the neonatal intestine, and contains factors that promote the growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum in the intestinal flora. Formula feeding seems to promote implantation and persistence of Clostridium perfringens, and clearly enhances intestinal colonization of C. difficile in newborns.
TI  - Increase of mannose residues, as Salmonella typhimurium-adhering factor, on the cecal mucosa of germ-free chickens infected with Eimeria tenella.
AB  - To study increase of the Salmonella population in the cecum of chickens infected  with Eimeria tenella, quantitative changes in mannose residues on the cecal mucosa were investigated. Inhibition of S typhimurium adherence to the cecum by a 2% carbohydrate (D-mannose, D-galactose, L-fucose, alpha-methyl-D-glucoside) in phosphate-buffered saline solution was examined. Only D-mannose had inhibitory effects. Whereas, D-galactose had somewhat enhancing effects on adherence of S typhimurium to the cecal mucosa of uninfected germ-free chickens. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose inhibited adherence of S typhimurium. D-Mannose significantly (P < 0.05) increased adherence of Bacteroides sp. In infected and uninfected chickens, D-mannose did not have any effect on adherence of Clostridium perfringens and Bifidobacterium thermophilum. Under microscopic observation, only concanavalin A and Lens culinaris agglutinin, of 8 lectins examined, were recognized as lectin-positive staining lines or spots in the cecal mucosa, indicating presence of mannose residues on the cecal mucosa. In E tenella-infected chickens, lectin-positive staining was seen strongly on the coarse surface of damaged cells and at the bottom of the crypts. These results indicate that coccidial infection may induce increase of mannose residues on the intestinal surface and allow adhesion of more salmonellae to the intestine.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - Azoreductase activity of anaerobic bacteria isolated from human intestinal microflora.
AB  - A plate assay was developed for the detection of anaerobic bacteria that produce  azoreductases. With this plate assay, 10 strains of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes were isolated from human feces and identified as Eubacterium hadrum (2 strains), Eubacterium spp. (2 species), Clostridium clostridiiforme, a Butyrivibrio sp., a Bacteroides sp., Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium nexile, and a Clostridium sp. The average rate of reduction of Direct Blue 15 dye (a dimethoxybenzidine-based dye) in these strains ranged from 16 to 135 nmol of dye per min per mg of protein. The enzymes were inactivated by oxygen. In seven isolates, a flavin compound (riboflavin, flavin adenine dinucleotide, or flavin mononucleotide) was required for azoreductase activity. In the other three isolates and in Clostridium perfringens, no added flavin was required for activity. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that each bacterium expressed only one azoreductase isozyme. At least three types of azoreductase enzyme were produced by the different isolates. All of the azoreductases were produced constitutively and released extracellularly.
TI  - Apparition of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides in the intestine of the newborn delivered by cesarian section.
AB  - Anaerobic flora plays a key role in preventing intestinal colonization with potential pathogens. Nowadays, the mechanisms involved in the colonization resistance provided by the anaerobic microflora are to be clarified. Numerous factors seem to intervene in the regulation of the intestinal flora. The purpose of the present study was to correlate the presence or relative absence of Clostridium sp. and Bacteroides with the colonization by C. perfringens, which is involved in lethal infections in an immunologically compromised host. The intestinal bacterial colonization of 20 newborns delivered by cesarian section was assessed sequentially over the first 14 days of life. C. perifringens is a strongly reducing microorganism and undoubtedly causes a decrease in the oxidoreduction potential of the newborn feces favouring the subsequent colonization by other putrefactive bacteria. C. perfringens seems to be the precursor for installation of putrefractive bacteria, as Bacteroides and other Clostridium sp.
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Antagonistic effect exerted by three strictly anaerobic strains against various strains of Clostridium perfringens in gnotobiotic rodent intestines.
AB  - Our purpose was to study bacterial antagonism between a limited number of strictly anaerobic strains and Clostridium perfringens in the intestinal tract of gnotobiotic rodents. Gnotobiotic mice harboring a Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a Fusobacterium necrogenes, and a Clostridium sp. strain were protected against pathogenic B, C, and D C. perfringens serotypes. A drastic antagonistic effect of this three-strain association was also observed against a nonpathogenic C. perfringens serotype A (CpA). It was less efficient in gnotobiotic rats than in mice and less efficient in gnotobiotic mice fed an autoclaved diet than in mice fed the same diet sterilized by irradiation. No diffusible inhibitory substances against CpA were detected in feces of gnotobiotic mice harboring the three antagonistic strains, and no nutrient depletion was demonstrated in filtrates prepared from 10-fold diluted feces of these mice. In vitro mixed cultures of the three antagonistic strains failed to inhibit growth of CpA, whereas CpA did not multiply in a 10-fold diluted feces from gnotobiotic mice. A reverse correlation between the initial number of antagonistic strains and the division number of CpA was determined using serially diluted fecal suspensions. Thus, large numbers of viable cells of both antagonistic strains were required to inhibit the target strain in fecal suspensions as was also found in gnotobiotic mice intestines. However, no diffusible inhibitory substance was detectable nor could depletion of growth factors be identified as causing antagonism. Whatever factors that may be responsible for antagonism were found to be influenced by the host and its diet.
TI  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. in fecal samples from breast-fed and bottle-fed infants with and without iron supplement.
AB  - Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Clostridium spp. isolated from the feces of 23  neonates during the first 3 months of life were identified. Of the 23 neonates, 10 were breast fed, 6 received an infant formula with iron supplement (5 mg/liter), and 7 received the formula without iron supplement (iron concentration, less than 0.5 mg/liter). The Bifidobacterium spp. most frequently isolated from the three groups of infants were B. longum, B. breve, B. adolescentis, and B. bifidum. The bacteroides spp. most frequently isolated were B. fragilis and B. vulgatus. The most common Clostridium sp. in the three groups of infants was C. perfringens. The type of milk did not select for species of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, or Clostridium, except for Clostridium butyricum, which was isolated significantly more often from bottle-fed infants with iron supplement than from the other groups, and Clostridium tertium, which was more often isolated from breast-fed infants. The species of the three anaerobic genera did not persist for a long period of time in the three groups of infants.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - [In vitro activity of the amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination on anaerobic bacteria. Comparison with amoxicillin, lamoxactam and metronidazole].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the combination amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AAC) (2/1 w/w) on 84 strains of obligate anaerobes were measured by the agar diffusion method and compared to those of amoxicillin (AMO), lamoxactam (LAM) and metronidazole (MET). For the 47 Bacteroides fragilis strains tested, the mode MIC was 0.5 microgram/ml with AAC, 1-2 with MET, 0.5-1 with LAM and 8-16 with AMO. A similar range of activity was found on the 16 other strains of Bacteroides sp.. AAC and AMO have a comparable activity on Clostridium perfringens (mode MIC 0.016-0.032 microgram/ml), superior to that of LAM (mode MIC 0.125) and MET (mode MIC 0.5). AAC and AMO have an almost identical activity on Peptococci and Peptostreptococci, the MIC for both drugs being less than 0.125 microgram/ml. A similar activity was found for LAM and MET.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - Methane and hydrogen production by human intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The gas above liquid cultures of a variety of human intestinal anaerobic bacteria was sampled and analysed by headspace gas chromatography. Hydrogen production was greatest with strains of the genus Clostridium, intermediate with anaerobic cocci and least with Bacteroides sp. Very few strains produced methane although small amounts were detected with one strain of B. thetaiotaomicron, C. perfringens and C. histolyticum. There may be a relationship between these anaerobic bacteria and several gastrointestinal disorders in which there is a build up of hydrogen or methane in the intestines.
TI  - Bacteriology of acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis of the aged.
AB  - Bacteriological examination was performed on bile from 23 patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis. Of 23 bile cultures, 15 yielded aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and 8 yielded aerobic bacteria only. No specimen grew anaerobic bacteria only. A total of 20 cultures yielded a polymicrobial flora, and 3 cultures grew one single aerobic bacterium. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., enterococci, Bacteroids fragilis, and Clostridium perfringens were the predominant bacterial flora in bile of these patients. Bacteremia was documented in 10 of the 12 patients cultured. All bacteremias involved aerobic bacteria and were polymicrobial in three patients. The frequent presence of anaerobes in bile of patients with acute obstructive suppurative cholangitis suggests that antimicrobial therapy should provide adequate coverage for anaerobic bacteria and enteric organisms.
TI  - Monensin, Eimeria tenella infection, and effects on the bacterial populations in  the ceca of gnotobiotic chickens.
AB  - Bacteria-free chicks in separate plastic film isolators were inoculated orally with single species of bacteria. Within an isolator, half the birds were fed unmedicated feed and half received feed containing 100 ppm monensin. With clostridium perfringens as the established species of monoflora, bacterial counts from the duodenum were 10(4) times lower and counts from the ceca were three times lower in monensin-fed birds compared to unmedicated birds. Infection with Eimeria tenella stimulated an eight-fold increase in the numbers of C. perfringens in the ceca of unmedicated birds but no increase in monensin-fed birds. With Bacteroides sp. or Streptococcus faecalis as monoflora, there was no difference in the cecal or duodenal populations between medicated and unmedicated birds uninfected with coccidia. In contrast to C. perfringens, populations of Bacteroides sp. and S. faecalis in the ceca decreased five to 100-fold in both medicated and unmedicated chicks after infection with E. tenella. Duodenal populations of C. perfringens, Bacteroides sp., and S. faecalis were unaffected by the coccidial infection.
TI  - [Susceptibility to Thiamphenicol and Chloramphenicol of Anaerobic Bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, With chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 Bacteroides fragilis, 13 B. thetaiotaomicron, 14 B. oralis, 16 Sphaerophorus varius etc.) had MIC values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. Very similar results (MIC, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. In concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. Strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (MIC, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to B. fragilis or other Bacteroides species. Members of the Fusobacterium and Sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. With both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (P. acnes, Peptostreptococcus spp., Peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. Of 37 Clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to C. perfringens, C. septicum, C. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Only one strain each of C. perfringens and Clostridium sp. had an MIC of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. Accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. A standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 Bacteroidaceae, 18 Peptococcaceae and 20 C, (P.) acnes strains. Only a poor correlation was observed between MIC and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. Therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. Thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - A rapid glutamic decarboxylase test for identification of bacteria.
AB  - A simple rapid glutamic decarboxylase test is described. This test was found useful in the identification of Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Providencia alcalifaciens, Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobic cultures.
AB  - A modified plate holding system for anaerobes has been developed which: 1) effectively reduces the volume of oxygen-free gas required, 2) promotes earlier bacterial growth, and 3) monitors the anaerobic atmosphere of the holding vessel and the rate of gas flow. Cultures of Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, C. septicum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptococcus sp. and Propionibacterium sp. were evaluated for optimal growth. All cultures grew as well as or better when preincubated in the holding system for one to three hours then incubated in a GasPak system for the remainder of the 24 hours, as compared to incubation only in the GasPak or holding system for the entire 24-hour period.
TI  - The reduction of N-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  - The role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of N-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (N-OH-AABP) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. This reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. These include cultures of Clostridium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus productus I, and Bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. In contrast, cultures of Lactobacillus plantarum and Escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. The reduction of N-OH-AABP is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. On a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing N-OH-AABP than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. The cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing N-OH-AABP than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. The products of the metabolism of N-OH-AABP have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. Glucuronide conjugates of N-OH-AABP are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. These results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing N-OH-AABP, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
TI  - Competitive effects of intestinal microflora on Vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - The coexistence of Vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. The bacteria tested included a Bacteroides sp, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens type A, 2 separate isolates of Escherichia coli, 2 different Lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Streptococcus faecalis. Each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. No single strain or species was found that would eliminate V cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. Not until a combination of E coli, P mirabilis, and S faecalis was present in the mice did V cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
