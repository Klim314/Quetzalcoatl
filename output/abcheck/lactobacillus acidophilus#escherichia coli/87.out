lactobacillus acidophilus induces virus immune defence genes in murine dendritic  cells by a toll-like receptor-2-dependent mechanism.
lactobacilli are probiotics that, among other health-promoting effects, have been ascribed immunostimulating and virus-preventive properties.
certain lactobacillus spp. have been shown to possess strong interleukin-12 (il-12) -inducing properties. as il-12 production depends on the up-regulation of type i interferons (ifns), we hypothesized that the strong il-12-inducing capacity of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm in murine bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (dcs) is caused by an up-regulation of ifn-beta, which subsequently induces il-12 and the double-stranded rna binding toll-like receptor-3 (tlr-3).
the expression of the genes encoding ifn-beta, tlr-3, il-12 and il-10 in dcs upon stimulation with l. acidophilus ncfm was determined.
lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm induced a much stronger expression of ifn-beta, il-12 and il-10 compared with the synthetic double-stranded rna ligand poly i:c, whereas the levels of expressed tlr-3 were similar.
whole genome microarray gene expression analysis revealed that other genes related to viral defence were significantly up-regulated and among the strongest induced genes in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm.
the ability to induce ifn-beta was also detected in another l. acidophilus strain (x37), but was not a property of other probiotic strains tested, i.e. bifidobacterium bifidum z9 and escherichia coli nissle 1917.
the ifn-beta expression was markedly reduced in tlr-2(-/-) dcs, dependent on endocytosis, and the major cause of the induction of il-12 and tlr-3 in dcs stimulated with l. acidophilus ncfm.
collectively, our results reveal that certain lactobacilli trigger the expression of viral defence genes in dcs in a tlr-2 manner dependent on ifn-beta.
