TI  == the culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  == the complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and staphylococcus aureus carriage. considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16s rrna gene community profiling. cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with finegoldia magna. staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as s. aureus' principle habitat. culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only  a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. while the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach.  to determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification  by culturomic analyses.

TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == bone and joint infections due to anaerobic bacteria: an analysis of 61 cases and  review of the literature.
AB  == the diagnosis of anaerobic bone and joint infections (bji) were underestimated before the advent of molecular identification and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). we report  61 cases of anaerobic infections based on our 4-year experience with the management of bji. a total of 75% of cases were post-surgical infections, associated with osteosynthesis devices (65%). early infections occurred in 27% of cases, delayed infections in 17.5% of cases, and late infections in 55% of cases. we recorded 36 species of 93 anaerobic strains using maldi-tof ms (91) and molecular methods (2). we identified 20 strains of propionibacterium acnes, 13 of finegoldia magna, six of peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, and six of p. harei. polymicrobial infections occurred in 50 cases. surgical treatment was performed in 93.5% of cases. the antibiotic treatments included amoxicillin (30%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (16%), metronidazole (30%), and clindamycin (26%). hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used in 17 cases (28%). the relapse rate (27%) was  associated with lower limbs localization (p = 0.001). p. acnes bji was associated with shoulder (p = 0.019), vertebra (p = 0.021), and head flap localization (p =  0.011), and none of these cases relapsed (p = 0.007). f. magna bji was associated with ankle localization (p = 0.014). anaerobic bji is typically considered as a post-surgical polymicrobial infection, and the management of this infection combines surgical and medical treatments. maldi-tof ms and molecular identification have improved diagnosis. thus, physicians should be aware of the polymicrobial nature of anaerobic bji to establish immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment during the post-surgical period until accurate microbiological results have been obtained.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. we studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes. daptomycin etest mics and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. for 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of c. difficile with elevated linezolid mics of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin mics of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. daptomycin mics were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 f. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. only one strain, a c. perfringens strain, had a mic of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. eighty-five and 92.5% of the etest mics were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. in time-kill studies, a c. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. vancomycin was not bactericidal for c. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the mic and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the mic.

TI  == in vitro activity of oritavancin (ly333328), vancomycin, clindamycin, and metronidazole against clostridium perfringens, propionibacterium acnes, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci.
AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.
