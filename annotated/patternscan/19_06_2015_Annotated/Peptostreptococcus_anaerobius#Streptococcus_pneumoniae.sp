TI  == antimicrobial activity of preparation bioaron c.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of sirupus bioaron c, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of aloe arborescens, was tested against  different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. the experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus candida and on 18 reference strains (atcc). the antimicrobial activity  of bioaron c (mbc and mfc) was determined at undiluted concentration. bioaron c proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. at the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (mbc, mfc) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, parvimonas micra, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus anginosus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans, already after 15 min. the mic of bioaron c against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. the great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. bioaron c  may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of atcc and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  == despite limitations of swab transport systems (sts), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. we evaluated the performance of 4 commercial sts: m40 transystem (s1, copan italia, bovezzo, italy), uni-ter (s2, meus, piove di sacco, italy), euromed (s3, lab service, surbo, italy), and eurotubo (s4, deltalab, rubi, spain). survival of atcc and clinical strains with  characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (nccls m40-a) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. after 24 h, only s1 was able to maintain streptococcus  pneumoniae (atcc 6305), haemophilus influenzae (10211), and neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all sts except s1 (46% recovery). eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with s1. resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the sts.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == [yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and  penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also  observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.

TI  == bacterial interference in the nasopharynx following antimicrobial therapy of acute otitis media.
AB  == the effect on the nasopharyngeal bacterial flora of therapy for 10 days with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil was studied in 50 children with acute otitis media. before therapy, potential pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis) were isolated in 14 (56%) of those treated  with co-amoxiclav and 15 (60%) of those treated with cefprozil. following therapy, the reduction in the number of these pathogens was the same in the two groups. however, differences between the groups were noted in the recovery of organisms with interfering capability, namely alpha-haemolytic streptococci, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and prevotella melaninogenica. fifty interfering organisms were recovered from each group before therapy. after therapy with co-amoxiclav or cefprozil their number declined to 11 and 42, respectively (p< 0.001).

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == [a clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  == ceftazidime (caz) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying  respiratory diseases. the clinical efficacy and side effects of caz were investigated. the mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and  48.0 kg, respectively. caz was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. in the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of peptococcus sp., fusobacterium necrophorum and serratia marcescens. side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated got, gpt and al-p values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after caz treatment was discontinued.

TI  == [growth of non-sporing anaerobes in an oxygen-free blood culture system (author's transl)].
AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. all isolates of bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria.  bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides oralis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were  noninhibitory. the 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
