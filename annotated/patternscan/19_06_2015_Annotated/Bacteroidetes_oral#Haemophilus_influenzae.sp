TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and pseudomonas aeruginosa in subgingival bacterial samples  from parous women.
AB  == background: information on the subgingival microbiota in parous women is limited. the present study assessed 74 bacterial species at periodontal sites. methods: subgingival bacterial plaque was collected from women > or =6 months after delivery. bacteria were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. gingivitis was defined as > or =20% of sites with bleeding on probing (bop), and periodontitis was defined as radiographic evidence of bone loss and probing depths > or =5.0 mm. results: a total of 197 women (mean age: 29.4 +/- 6.8 years; range: 18 to 46 years) were included in the study. gingivitis was identified in 82 of 138 subjects without evidence of periodontitis (59.4%). periodontitis was found in 59 women (32%). higher bacterial levels in subjects with gingivitis compared to those without evidence of gingivitis were observed for actinomyces neuii, bifidobacterium bifidum, corynebacterium pseudogenitalis,  porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella bivia, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (p <0.001 for each). higher bacterial levels in subjects with periodontitis compared to those without periodontitis (bop not accounted for) were found for 32 of 79 species (p <0.001) including lactobacillus iners, haemophilus influenzae, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella bivia, p. aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus. binary univariate logistic regression analysis identified that p. aeruginosa (p <0.001) and t. forsythia (p <0.05) were independently predictive of periodontal status. the odds ratio of having p. aeruginosa at levels > or =1 x 10(5) in the sample and periodontitis was 3.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.6 to 5.9; p <0.001). conclusion: in addition to p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, a diverse microbiota,  including p. aeruginosa, p. endodontalis, p. bivia, and s. aureus, can be found in subgingival plaque samples from women of child-bearing age with periodontitis.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == porphyrin-mediated cell surface heme capture from hemoglobin by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == the porphyrin requirements for growth recovery of porphyromonas gingivalis in heme-depleted cultures are investigated. in addition to physiologically relevant  sources of heme, growth recovery is stimulated by a number of noniron porphyrins. these data demonstrate that, as for haemophilus influenzae, reliance on captured  iron and on exogenous porphyrin is manifest as an absolute growth requirement for heme. a number of outer membrane proteins including some gingipains contain the hemoglobin receptor (ha2) domain. in cell surface extracts, polypeptides derived  from ha2-containing proteins predominated in hemoglobin binding. the in vitro porphyrin-binding properties of a recombinant ha2 domain were investigated and found to be iron independent. porphyrins that differ from protoporphyrin ix in only the vinyl aspect of the tetrapyrrole ring show comparable effects in competing with hemoglobin for ha2 and facilitate growth recovery. for some porphyrins which differ from protoporphyrin ix at both propionic acid side chains, the modification is detrimental in both these assays. correlations of porphyrin competition and growth recovery imply that the ha2 domain acts as a high-affinity hemophore at the cell surface to capture porphyrin from hemoglobin. while some proteins involved with heme capture bind directly to the iron center,  the ha2 domain of p. gingivalis recognizes heme by a mechanism that is solely porphyrin mediated.

TI  == acute bacterial suppurative parotitis: microbiology and management.
AB  == the parotid gland is the salivary gland most commonly affected by inflammation. the most common pathogens associated with acute bacterial parotitis are staphylococcus aureus and anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes include gram-negative bacilli (including pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp.), fusobacterium spp., and peptostreptococcus spp. streptococcus spp. (including s.  pneumoniae) and gram-negative bacilli (including escherichia coli) have also been reported. gram-negative organisms are often seen in hospitalized patients. organisms less frequently found are arachnia, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, salmonella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, treponema pallidum, cat-scratch bacillus, and eikenella corrodens. mycobacterium tuberculosis and atypical mycobacteria are rare causes of parotitis. therapy includes maintenance  of hydration and administration of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. once an abscess has formed surgical drainage is required. the choice of antimicrobial depends on the etiologic agent. maintenance of good oral hygiene, adequate hydration, and early and proper therapy of bacterial infection of the oropharynx  may reduce the occurrence of suppurative parotitis.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == immune response to fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and other anaerobes in children with acute tonsillitis.
AB  == the number of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was determined in the saliva of 20 children with acute group a beta-haemolytic streptococcal (gabhs) pharyngo-tonsillitis, and 20 with acute non-gabhs tonsillitis. antibody titres to four gram-negative anaerobic bacilli that reside in the oropharynx (fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were determined in these and 20 control patients. an average of 8.8 aerobic and anaerobic isolates per patient saliva specimens were found during the acute tonsillitis stage in both groups, and 6.9 (in gabhs tonsillitis) and 5.6 (in non-gabhs tonsillitis) 5-6 weeks later. there were 10- to 1000-fold more bacteria in the acute stages of the inflammation in both gabhs  and non-gabhs groups. these bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, peptostreptococcus spp., f. nucleatum, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp. significantly higher antibodies levels to  f. nucleatum and p. intermedia were found in the second serum sample of patients  with non-gabhs pharyngo-tonsillitis (p < 0.001) and gabhs tonsillitis (p < 0.05), as compared with their first sample or the levels of antibodies in controls. the  increase in the number of several aerobic and anaerobic bacteria during acute tonsillitis and the increase in antibody levels to f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, known oral pathogens, may suggest a possible pathogenic role for these organisms in acute non-gabhs and gabhs tonsillitis.

TI  == pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  == the pharmacodynamic properties of faropenem, a new oral penem antibiotic, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. time-kill  kinetics were employed against strains of bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and streptococcus pyogenes. the postantibiotic effects of faropenem were studied using strains of e. coli, s. aureus, h. influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae.  the time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that faropenem has bactericidal activity. faropenem exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect against all strains except h. influenzae.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == the predominant microflora of the palatal mucosa in an elderly island population.
AB  == the prevalence and microbiology of macrophotographically documented denture stomatitis were studied in denture wearers participating in an interdisciplinary  health-monitoring project (koster health project) on the koster islands, sweden.  upper dentures were used by 26.6% of the adult population, and 59.2% of the denture wearers had stomatitis. denture stomatitis type i was identified as sialadenitis. the more severe forms of denture stomatitis (types ii and iii) demonstrated increased recovery of microorganisms in the palatal mucosa in addition to sialadenitis. only one proband showed increased growth of fungi. hemophilus spp. and bacteroides spp. were the predominating microorganisms in stomatitis types ii and iii. shifts in the normal oral flora are suggested to be  an important factor for the development of denture stomatitis. it is concluded that bacterial colonization on the palatal mucosa may play an important role in denture stomatitis in this relatively healthy population.

TI  == chloramphenicol: recent developments and clinical indications.
AB  == recent developments (including more accurate assays) that have led to revised recommendations for route of administration, dosage, and indications for chloramphenicol are reviewed. chloramphenicol is most bioavailable by the oral route; doses of 75 mg/kg/day provide adequate therapeutic concentrations for most clinical indications. serum concentrations of the drug should be monitored to ensure adequate therapeutic concentrations and to avoid toxicity. this is particularly important in newborns, in patients with liver dysfunction, and in those receiving concomitant drugs that may influence free chloramphenicol concentrations. the indications for chloramphenicol therapy evaluated are: haemophilus influenzae infections, anaerobic infections, salmonellosis, rocky mountain spotted fever, and eye infections. chloramphenicol is useful in the treatment of invasive haemophilus influenzae infections resistant to ampicillin,  in selected anaerobic and ocular infections, and for rickettsioses in patients under the age of eight years. because the rare but life-threatening complication  of chloramphenicol (aplastic anemia) persists, indications for the drug's clinical use are narrowing once again with the advent of third-generation cephalosporins highly active against gram-negative bacilli including ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae. similarly, metronidazole or clindamycin may be preferred for some anaerobic infections.

TI  == should fiberoptic bronchoscopy aspirates be cultured?
AB  == the reliability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy as a method to study the bacteriology  of the lower respiratory tract was tested. the procedure used was suction aspiration through the inner channel after topical anesthesia with lidocaine. to  detect contamination by oropharyngeal bacteria, the aspirates were cultured in patients with no evidence of active infection, comparison was made with results of transtracheal aspiration cultures, and the aspirate was tested for the presence of an oral dye marker. results with all 3 methods of analysis indicated  contamination with oropharyngeal bacteria that were presumably introduced during  instrumentation through the upper airways. an additional factor studied was the effect of topical anesthetics. analysis of aspirates showed that as much as 96 per cent of the specimen was anesthetic solution. lidocaine also proved toxic to  lower respiratory tract pathogens, although there were significant differences between bacterial species. it was concluded that fiberoptic bronchoscopy as performed in this study does not reliably reflect the bacteriology of the lower respiratory tract.
