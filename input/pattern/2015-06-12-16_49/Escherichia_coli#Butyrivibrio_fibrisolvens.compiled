TI  - Leaky intestine and impaired microbiome in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mouse model.
AB  - Emerging evidence has demonstrated that intestinal homeostasis and the microbiome play essential roles in neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons and muscle atrophy. Currently, there is no effective treatment. Most patients die within 3-5 years due to respiratory paralysis. Although the death of motor neurons is a hallmark of ALS, other organs may also contribute to the disease progression. We examined the gut of an ALS mouse model, G93A, which expresses mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1(G93A)), and discovered a damaged tight junction structure and increased permeability with a significant reduction in the expression levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin. Furthermore, our data demonstrated increased numbers of abnormal Paneth cells in the intestine of G93A mice. Paneth cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells that can sense microbes and secrete antimicrobial peptides, thus playing key roles in host innate immune responses and shaping the gut microbiome. A decreased level of the antimicrobial peptides defensin 5 alpha was indeed found in the ALS intestine. These changes were associated with a shifted profile of the intestinal microbiome, including reduced levels of Butyrivibrio Fibrisolvens, Escherichia coli, and Fermicus, in G93A mice. The relative abundance of bacteria was shifted in G93A mice compared to wild-type mice. Principal coordinate analysis indicated a difference in fecal microbial communities between ALS and wild-type mice. Taken together, our study suggests a potential novel role of the intestinal epithelium and microbiome in the progression of ALS.
TI  - Paenibacillus polymyxa JB05-01-1 and its perspectives for food conservation and medical applications.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate a novel bacterial strain with strong and broad spectrum antibacterial activity from a livestock feed prebiotic supplement. A novel strain, termed Paenibacillus polymyxa JB05-01-1, was isolated using traditional microbiological methods and identified on the basis of its phenotypic and biochemical properties as well as its 16S rRNA gene sequence. This strain was able to inhibit growth of gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli RR1, Pseudomonas fluorescens R73, Pantoea agglomerans BC1, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OR85, and Fibrobacter succinogenes. The above antagonism against the aforementioned bacteria was attributed to production of an antimicrobial substance(s) termed "JB05-01-1." Its production was optimal during the stationary phase. JB05-01-1 has a molecular weight of 2.5 KDa, its mode of action is bactericidal, and the divalent cations, Ca(2+) and Mn(2+), reduced its lethality. The antibacterial activity was heat-stable and was effective at a pH range of 2-9. Enzymes like trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and proteinase K have abolished the antibacterial activity of JB05-01-1 indicating a proteinaceous motif. This type of naturally occurring bacteria and inhibitory substance(s) could represent an additional value in livestock feed supplements. The natural presence of antibacterial activity indicates an opportunity to decrease the addition of antibiotics.
TI  - Augmentation of vaccenate production and suppression of vaccenate biohydrogenation in cultures of mixed ruminal microbes.
AB  - To increase ruminal outflow of trans-vaccenic acid (t-VA), a new strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (MDT-10) was isolated that has a great ability to hydrogenate linoleic acid (LA) to t-VA. When strain MDT-10 was added to the batch cultures of mixed ruminal microbes (1% of the total number of viable ruminal bacteria), LA conversion to t-VA increased greatly; after 3 h, t-VA levels were > 4-fold higher than the control. By 10 h, all of the t-VA was hydrogenated to stearic acid. However, when a new strain of Bifidobacterium adolescentis (HF-11), which has a high capacity for incorporation of t-VA, was added in conjunction with MDT-10 (1% of the total number of ruminal bacteria), t-VA levels after 10 h were 6 times higher than with MDT-10 alone. These results suggest that t-VA produced by MDT-10 was incorporated into HF-11 cells, resulting in protection of t-VA from t-VA-hydrogenating microbes. Similar results were obtained in a continuous culture of mixed ruminal microbes in which addition of HF-11 simultaneously with MDT-10 increased the amount of t-VA in the effluent 2.5-fold. Both MDT-10 and HF-11 appeared to grow readily in the presence of mixed ruminal microbes. Sixty-two percent of t-VA incorporated by HF-11 was present in the free form, whereas 19, 15, and 3%, respectively, were incorporated into monoacylglycerol, glycerophospholipid, and diacylglycerol fractions. Because these lipids can be digested in the small intestine, it is likely that most t-VA in HF-11 cells is absorbed. Thus, introduction of MDT-10 and HF-11 simultaneously to the rumen might increase the amount of t-VA absorbed and might consequently increase the conversion of t-VA to conjugated linoleic acid in tissue.
TI  - Construction of a promoter-rescue plasmid for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and its use in characterization of a flagellin promoter.
AB  - The Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens/Escherichia coli shuttle vector pBHerm has been modified to produce a plasmid (pBHE) that can be used for the identification and characterization of promoters in B. fibrisolvens. pBHE allows the insertion of a test promoter immediately upstream of a promoterless erythromycin resistance gene (ermAM). The efficacy of the pBHE plasmid in isolating and characterizing promoters was tested by inserting the flagellin gene (flaA) promoter from B. fibrisolvens OR77. Transcription of the ermAM gene from the flaA promoter was significantly higher than that observed when the ermAM gene was under the control of its own promoter. The flagelling gene of OR77 appears to be transcribed from two different promoters that produce transcripts initiating approximately 130 bp apart. Two mutant flaA promoter constructs, containing mutations in the -10 and -35 regions of either of the two putative promoter regions, showed drastic alterations in both the origin and amounts of the two transcripts produced. Mutations in either promoter affected transcription from both promoters, indicating that both regions contribute to gene expression.
TI  - Constitutive expression of a heterologous Eubacterium ruminantium xylanase gene (xynA) in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - An Eubacterium ruminantium xylanase gene (xynA) was inserted into pYK4, a shuttle vector replicable in both Escherichia coli and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and the resultant chimeric plasmid (pYK4XT) was electroporated into B. fibrisolvens OB156C in an attempt to obtain a more xylanolytic B. fibrisolvens. Electrotransformants were screened by the development of erythromycin resistance, followed by an activity staining and Southern hybridization. The presence of mRNA from xynA in the transformant, B. fibrisolvens NO4, was confirmed by Northern hybridization. Xylanase activity of the transformant NO4 was apparently enhanced regardless of carbon sources in the medium. When grown on glucose or cellobiose. NO4 had approximately 5-6 times higher intracellular activity than the parent OB156C on a culture volume basis as well as protein basis. The transformant showed extracellular xylanase activity much higher (between 7- and 10(4)-fold) than the parent. Transformant NO4 recorded the highest activity when grown on xylan. Most (> 90%) of the activity was extracellular. The extracellular activity was 2-fold greater in NO4. These findings indicate that the introduced xynA was expressed constitutively and the xylanase protein was exported into the culture supernatant. Growth of NO4 on glucose was similar to that of OB156C, which suggests little extra load for plasmid maintenance and foreign xylanase production in the transformant. The plasmid pYK4XT was maintained stably in the transformant for more than 100 generations.
TI  - Sequence analysis and characterization of pOM1, a small cryptic plasmid from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and its use in construction of a new family of cloning vectors for Butyrivibrios.
AB  - As a preliminary step in the development of vector systems, we have isolated and  begun to characterize small, cryptic plasmids from several strains of the rumen bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. We present here the complete nucleotide sequence of Butyrivibrio plasmid pOM1, which was isolated from B. fibrisolvens Bu49. While it is very similar in size to the previously characterized Butyrivibrio plasmids pRJF1 and pRJF2, pOM1 exhibits a restriction pattern which is quite distinct. Analysis of sequence data reveals that pOM1 contains only two open reading frames of significant length (ORF1 and ORF2), both of which are required for self-replication and maintenance. The protein encoded in ORF1 shows homologies with Pre (plasmid recombination enzyme) proteins encoded in plasmids from gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bacillus thuringiensis. The putative translation product of ORF2, on the other hand, resembles Rep (replication) proteins of a different group of gram-positive plasmids, for which the Staphylococcus plasmid pSN2 is a prototype. Unlike the other characterized-Butyrivibrio plasmids, pOM1 appears to replicate via a rolling-circle mechanism. Experimental evidence showing the presence of a single-stranded replication intermediate consistent with this mechanism is presented. pOM1 has been used in the construction of a new Escherichia coli-B. fibrisolvens shuttle vector, pSMerm1, which has been successfully used to introduce a cloned gene into B. fibrisolvens harboring the pRJF1 plasmid.
TI  - Expression of a Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14 gene (cinB) encoding an enzyme with cinnamoyl ester hydrolase activity is negatively regulated by the product of an adjacent gene (cinR).
AB  - A second cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (CEH) encoding gene (cinB) has been characterized from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14. CinB is more similar to CinA (previously named CinI) (28% amino acid identify), the first CEH described from B. fibrisolvens E14, than either of the enzymes are to any other member of the family of hydrolases to which they belong. Upstream of cinB, and in the opposite orientation, is a gene (cinR) encoding a protein with substantial similarity to members of the MarR family of negative regulators of bacterial gene expression. By alignment of these sequences, a possible helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain has been identified. CinR was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli using the lac promoter. In E. coli CinR repressed the expression of CinB, but had no effect on the expression of CinA. In gel mobility-shift assays, CinR bound specifically to the cinR-cinB intergenic region. Two identical 16 nucleotide inverted repeats adjacent to the putative PcinR and PcinB promoters are likely binding sites for CinR. The addition of FAXX (O-[5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-alpha-L-arabinofuranosyl]-(1,3)- O-beta-D-xylopyranosyl-(1,4)-D-xylopyranose) and Fara [5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose], but not xylobiose, ferulic acid and a number of other soluble components of hemicellulose, inhibited the binding of CinR to DNA.
TI  - Cloning of cellobiose phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase genes: functional expression in recombinant Escherichia coli and identification of a putative binding region for disaccharides.
AB  - Genomic libraries from nine cellobiose-metabolizing bacteria were screened for cellobiose utilization. Positive clones were recovered from six libraries, all of which encode phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) proteins. Clones from Bacillus subtilis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and Klebsiella oxytoca allowed the growth of recombinant Escherichia coli in cellobiose-M9 minimal medium. The K. oxytoca clone, pLOI1906, exhibited an unusually broad substrate range (cellobiose, arbutin, salicin, and methylumbelliferyl derivatives of glucose, cellobiose, mannose, and xylose) and was sequenced. The insert in this plasmid encoded the carboxy-terminal region of a putative regulatory protein, cellobiose permease (single polypeptide), and phospho-beta-glucosidase, which appear to form an operon (casRAB). Subclones allowed both casA and casB to be expressed independently, as evidenced by in vitro complementation. An analysis of the translated sequences from the EIIC domains of cellobiose, aryl-beta-glucoside, and other disaccharide permeases allowed the identification of a 50-amino-acid conserved region. A disaccharide consensus sequence is proposed for the most conserved segment (13 amino acids), which may represent part of the EIIC active site for binding and phosphorylation.
TI  - Cloning of a gene encoding cinnamoyl ester hydrolase from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14 by a novel method.
AB  - A gene (cinI) encoding a cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (CEH) has been isolated from the ruminal bacterium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14, using a model substrate, MUTMAC [4-methylumbelliferoyl (p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride)]. CinI has significant amino-acid similarities with members of a large and diverse family of hydrolases with a serine/aspartic acid/histidine catalytic triad. Our analyses identified two previously unclassified amino acid sequences, the amino-terminal domain of unknown function in XynZ from Clostridium thermocellum and XynC, an acetylxylan esterase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, as members of the same family of hydrolases. A previously described esterase with CEH activity, XylD from Pseudomonas fluorescens ssp. cellulosa, is not similar to CinI. CinI was expressed at high levels in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli TOPP2 and released ferulic acid from Fara [5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose] prepared from wheat bran.
TI  - Stereochemical course and reaction products of the action of beta-xylosidase from Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum strain B6A-RI.
AB  - Beta-Xylosidases are grouped in families 39 and 43 of a general classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino acid sequence similarities. The Beta-xylosidase from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which belongs to family 43, has been shown to operate by a molecular mechanism which results in the inversion of the anomeric configuration. Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum B6A-RI Beta-xylosidase which belongs to family 39 was purified as a recombinant enzyme from Escherichia coli. The stereochemistry of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl Beta-D-xylopyranoside was followed by 1H NMR. The spectrum recorded after 2 h hydrolysis showed a large signal centred at 4.47 ppm (J approximately 10 Hz) assignable to H1 of free Beta-xylose with a small amount of alpha-xylose (5.05 ppm, J approximately 3 Hz) attributable to mutarotation. This result indicates that T. saccharolyticum Beta-xylosidase operates with overall retention of the anomeric configuration. This result, with the lack of sequence similarity between the two families of Beta-xylosidases, suggests that these two families have major differences in their active-site geometries. Consistent with its retaining mechanism, Beta-xylosidase of T. saccharolyticum B6A-RI also displayed transglycosylating activity:reverse-phase HPLC showed approximately 30% conversion of p-nitrophenyl Beta-D-xylopyranoside into a number of higher nitrophenyl oligosaccharides after 5 min incubation with the enzyme. The structure of the most abundant oligosaccharides could be determined by total correlation spectroscopy NMR and showed that the enzyme can build Beta-1,4, Beta-1,3- and Beta-1,2-linked xylo-oligosaccharides.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a membrane-associated Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 beta-glucosidase with cellodextrinase and cyanoglycosidase activities.
AB  - Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 is a gram-negative, anaerobic gastrointestinal bacterium. A 2.4-kbp chromosomal fragment from P. ruminicola encoding an 87-kDa aryl-glucosidase (CdxA) with cellodextrinase activity was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and sequenced. CdxA activity was found predominantly in the membrane fraction of both P. ruminicola and E. coli, but P. ruminicola localized the protein extracellularly while E. coli did not. The hydrolase had the highest activity on cellodextrins (3.43 to 4.13 mumol of glucose released min-1 mg of protein-1) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside (3.54 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1). Significant activity (70% of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. Less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose. CdxA attacks cellodextrins from the nonreducing end, releasing glucose units, and appears to be an exo-1,4-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.74) which also is able to attack beta-1,6 linkages. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other glycosyl-hydrolases suggests that this enzyme belongs to family 3 (B. Henrissat, Biochem. J. 280:309-316, 1991). On the basis of this sequence alignment, the catalytic residues are believed to be Asp-275 and Glu-265. This is the first report of a cloned ruminal bacterial enzyme which can cleave cyanogenic plant compounds and which may therefore contribute to cyanide toxicity in ruminants.
TI  - Genetic analysis of the minimal replicon of plasmid pIP417 and comparison with the other encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmids from Bacteroides spp.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the DNA replication origin region of a Bacteroides vulgatus plasmid, pIP417, encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance has been determined. This region of 1934 bp presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication protein-dependent origins. It contains a large open reading frame which could encode a basic Rep protein (RepA) of 36.8 kDa. Upstream of this ORF exist an AT-rich region, three direct repeats (iterons) of 21 bp, multiple DnaA binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor (IHF). Moreover, the amino acid sequence of the pIP417 RepA protein shows similarities with those of other Rep proteins encoded by plasmids of gram-negative bacteria: pRO1600 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa; pPS10 from Pseudomonas syringae; pFA3 from Neisseria gonorrhoeae; and two cryptic plasmids from Campylobacter hyointestinalis and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. Although RepA can be expressed in an Escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation assay, vectors containing the pIP417 replication origin did not replicate in E. coli. The homology of the pIP417 replication region with the corresponding regions of other Bacteroides spp, plasmids was also studied by Southern blot hybridization. The results indicated that the repA gene of plasmid pIP417 is homologous to that of plasmid pIP421, but not of plasmid pIP419. The replication region of plasmid pIP421 was sequenced and showed about 80% identity at the nucleotide level with that of pIP417. A small (3634-bp) cloning vector (pFK12) of entirely defined nucleotide sequence was constructed for Bacteroides spp.
TI  - A stable and efficient transformation system for Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens OB156.
AB  - A 9.5-kb shuttle vector capable of replication and selection in both Escherichia  coli and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was constructed. Plasmid pUC118 provided replication functions and ampicillin resistance selection in E. coli. In B. fibrisolvens, replication was controlled by the native plasmid pRJF1 from strain OB156, and selectability was provided by a 3.5-kb fragment of plasmid pAM beta 1 containing the erythromycin resistance gene. Optimum conditions for transformation were 15 kV/cm, 2 h recovery, and plating in an agar overlay on medium containing 10 micrograms erythromycin/ml. Maximum efficiency was 1.1 x 10(5) transformants per micrograms plasmid DNA (average 3 x 10(4)), and restriction mechanisms reduced efficiency by a factor of 2 x 10(2). Nonselective growth for 200 generations gave no measurable loss of plasmid.
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Detoxification of the plant toxin fluoroacetate by a genetically modified rumen bacterium.
AB  - We isolated the fluoroacetate dehalogenase gene (H1), from Moraxella species strain B, and placed it under the transcriptional control of a 154 bp fragment of the erm gene promoter. The promoter/gene construct was attached to the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens shuttle vector pBHerm, and the resulting dehalogenase expression plasmid (pBHf) was transferred to B. fibrisolvens OB156 by electroporation. The erm gene promoter directed expression of dehalogenase activity in both E. coli and B. fibrisolvens OB156. Cell-free lysates of the genetically modified OB156 defluorinated 10.6 nmol fluoroacetate/min/mg protein. Growing cultures of OB156 were able to detoxify fluoroacetate in the culture medium, at the rate of 9.9 nmol/min/mg. Plasmid pBHf was retained by 100% of OB156 cells after 500 generations of non-selective culture. The restriction pattern of pBHf remained unchanged after extensive non-selective growth and host bacteria continued to produce active dehalogenase. The construction of rumen bacteria that are able to detoxify an important natural poison supports the feasibility of using genetically modified rumen bacteria to aid animal production.
TI  - Features of the cellodextrinase gene from Fibrobacter succinogenes S85.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.3-kb DNA fragment containing a cellodextrinase gene (cedA) from the ruminal anaerobe Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 was determined. Activity was expressed from this fragment when it was cloned in both orientations in pBluescript KS+ and SK-, indicating a functional F. succinogenes promoter in Escherichia coli. Promoter sequences (TTGAACA and AATAA) were identified upstream of the ATG initiation codon preceded by a putative ribosome binding site. The cedA open reading frame of 1071 base pairs encoded a protein of 357 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 41.9 kDa, similar to the 40-kDa size of the native protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography. CedA is proposed to belong to family 5 (family A) of the glycosyl hydrolases. The primary structure of the cellodextrinase showed over 40% similarity with endoglucanase 3 from F. succinogenes S85. Short regions of similarity were also demonstrated with endoglucanase C from Clostridium thermocellum, CelA from Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and two exoglucanases from yeast.
TI  - A new type of glutamine synthetase in cyanobacteria: the protein encoded by the glnN gene supports nitrogen assimilation in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803.
AB  - A new glutamine synthetase gene, glnN, which encodes a polypeptide of 724 amino acid residues (M(r), 79,416), has been identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803; this is the second gene that encodes a glutamine synthetase (GS) in this cyanobacterium. The functionality of this gene was evidenced by its ability to complement an Escherichia coli glnA mutant and to support Synechocystis growth in a strain whose glnA gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis. In this mutant (strain SJCR3), as well as in the wild-type strain, the second GS activity was subject to regulation by the nitrogen source, being strongly enhanced in nitrogen-free medium. Transcriptional fusion of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene with the 5'-upstream region of glnN suggested that synthesis of the second Synechocystis GS is regulated at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the level of glnN mRNA, a transcript of about 2,300 bases, was found to be strongly increased in nitrogen-free medium. The glnN product is similar to the GS subunits of Bacteroides fragilis and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, two obligate anaerobic bacteria whose GSs are markedly different from other prokaryotic and eukaryotic GSs. However, significant similarity is evident in the five regions which are homologous in all of the GSs so far described. The new GS gene was also found in other cyanobacteria but not in N2-fixing filamentous species.
TI  - Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens gene encoding a  type III glutamine synthetase.
AB  - A Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens glnA gene encoding glutamine synthetase (GS) was cloned on a recombinant plasmid pGS4 which enabled Escherichia coli glnA deletion mutants to utilize (NH4)2SO4 as a sole source of nitrogen. The nucleotide sequence of a 2423 bp DNA segment containing the GS-coding region of B. fibrisolvens was determined and the complete amino acid sequence (701 residues) was deduced. Comparisons of the derived B. fibrisolvens GS protein sequence with the amino acid sequences of GS from other bacteria indicate that it is the second reported example of a type III GS, originally identified in the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis. The presence of GS in B. fibrisolvens cells and the regulation of the cloned GS in E. coli cells was demonstrated by Western blot analysis.
TI  - The gene encoding the cellulase (Avicelase) Cel1 from Streptomyces reticuli and analysis of protein domains.
AB  - Streptomyces reticuli produces an unusual cellulase (Avicelase), with an apparent molecular weight of 82 kDa, which is solely sufficient to degrade crystalline cellulose. During cultivation the processing of the Avicelase to a truncated enzyme (42 kDa) and an inactive protein (40 kDa) correlated with the occurrence of an extracellular protease. After its purification this 36 kDa protease cleaved the S. reticuli Avicelase in vitro in the same manner. Using antibodies raised against the Avicelase and its truncated form (42 kDa) and gene libraries of S. reticuli DNA in the Escherichia coli phage vectors lambda gt11 and Charon 35, the Avicelase gene (cel1) was identified. Further subcloning and DNA-sequencing revealed a G+C rich (72%) reading frame of 2238 bp encoding a protein of 746 amino acids. The transcriptional start site was mapped about 180 bp upstream from the GTG start codon. A signal sequence of 29 amino acids was identified by aligning the deduced amino acids with the characterized N-terminus of the 82 kDa Avicelase. Comparison of the N-terminal amino acids from the purified proteins with the amino acid sequence derived from the Avicelase gene revealed that the truncated enzyme (42 kDa) corresponds to the C-terminal region whereas the inactive proteolytically derived protein (40 kDa) represents the N-terminal part of the 82 kDa Avicelase. Comparisons with amino acid sequences deduced from known cellulase genes indicated the presence of three putative protein domains: (i) an N-terminal part showing significant similarity with a repeat region of endoglucanase C from Cellulomonas fimi, recently shown to be a cellulose-binding domain; (ii) an adjoining region sharing homology with the N-terminal domains with unknown function of endoglucanase A from Pseudomonas fluorescens, endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum and a cellodextrinase from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and (iii) a C-terminal catalytic domain belonging to cellulase family E.
TI  - Cloning and expression of an amylase gene from Streptococcus bovis in Escherichia coli.
AB  - An amylase gene was identified in a Streptococcus bovis 033 lambda gtWES lambda B genomic library. Using a starch overlay and a Congo red-iodine staining procedure, amylase positive clones could be identified by zones of clearing. Ten amylase positive clones were identified using this procedure. The clone chosen for further study, lambda SBA105, contained an insert of approximately 7.5 kb. The insert was mapped, and subcloning localized the amylase gene to a region of approximately 3.1 kb. Cloning of the 3.1 kb amylase fragment into pUC18 in both orientations revealed that the amylase gene was transcribed from its own promoter. Amylase activity was expressed by the Escherichia coli subclones and was found to be largely associated with the cytoplasmic fraction. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA from the amylolytic strains, S. bovis 033, S. bovis 077, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 194 and 195 revealed a single hybridizing band in S. bovis 033 DNA only. This indicates that the amylase gene from S. bovis may differ from the amylases of these other amylolytic bacteria.
TI  - The cellodextrinase from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa consists of multiple functional domains.
AB  - A genomic library of Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa DNA was constructed in pUC18 and Escherichia coli recombinants expressing 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-cellobioside-hydrolysing activity (MUCase) were isolated. Enzyme produced by MUCase-positive clones did not hydrolyse either cellobiose or cellotriose but converted cellotetraose into cellobiose and cleaved cellopentaose and cellohexaose, producing a mixture of cellobiose and cellotriose. There was no activity against CM-cellulose, insoluble cellulose or xylan. On this basis, the enzyme is identified as an endo-acting cellodextrinase and is designated cellodextrinase C (CELC). Nucleotide sequencing of the gene (celC) which directs the synthesis of CELC revealed an open reading frame of 2153 bp, encoding a protein of Mr 80,189. The deduced primary sequence of CELC was confirmed by the Mr of purified CELC (77,000) and by the experimentally determined N-terminus of the enzyme which was identical with residues 38-47 of the translated sequence. The N-terminal region of CELC showed strong homology with endoglucanase, xylanases and an arabinofuranosidase of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa; homologous sequences included highly conserved serine-rich regions. Full-length CELC bound tightly to crystalline cellulose. Truncated forms of celC from which the DNA sequence encoding the conserved domain had been deleted, directed the synthesis of a functional cellodextrinase that did not bind to crystalline cellulose. This is consistent with the N-terminal region of CELC comprising a non-catalytic cellulose-binding domain which is distinct from the catalytic domain. The role of the cellulose-binding region is discussed.
TI  - Characterization of the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens glgB gene, which encodes a glycogen-branching enzyme with starch-clearing activity.
AB  - A Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c glgB gene, was isolated by direct selection for  colonies that produced clearing on starch azure plates. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli from its own promoter. The glgB gene consisted of an open reading frame of 1,920 bp encoding a protein of 639 amino acids (calculated Mr, 73,875) with 46 to 50% sequence homology with other branching enzymes. A limited region of 12 amino acids showed sequence similarity to amylases and glucanotransferases. The B. fibrisolvens branching enzyme was not able to hydrolyze starch but stimulated phosphorylase alpha-mediated incorporation of glucose into alpha-1,4-glucan polymer 13.4-fold. The branching enzyme was purified to homogeneity by a simple two-step procedure; N-terminal sequence and amino acid composition determinations confirmed the deduced translational start and amino acid sequence of the open reading frame. The enzymatic properties of the purified enzyme were investigated. The enzyme transferred chains of 5 to 10 (optimum, 7) glucose units, using amylose and amylopetin as substrates, to produce a highly branched polymer.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a 73 kDa xylanase enzyme from the rumen anaerobe Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c.
AB  - The cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3 kb DNA segment on pLS206 containing a xylanase gene (xynB) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was investigated. The open reading frame (ORF) of 1905 bp encoded a xylanase of 635 amino acid residues (Mr 73156). At least 850 bp at the 3' end of the gene could be deleted without loss of xylanase activity. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by purifying the enzyme and subjecting it to N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. In Escherichia coli C600 (pLS206) cells the xylanase was localized in the cytoplasm. Its optimum pH for activity was between pH 5.4 and 6, and optimum temperature 55 degrees C. The primary structure of the xylanase showed a significant level of identity with a cellobiohydrolase/endoglucanase of Caldocellum saccharolyticum, as well as with the xylanases of the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125, B. fibrisolvens strain 49, and Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.
TI  - Cloning, nucleotide sequence, and enzymatic characterization of an alpha-amylase  from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c.
AB  - A Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens amylase gene was cloned and expressed by using its own promoter on the recombinant plasmid pBAMY100 in Escherichia coli. The amylase gene consisted of an open reading frame of 2,931 bp encoding a protein of 976 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 106,964. In E. coli(pBAMY100), more than 86% of the active amylase was located in the periplasm, and TnphoA fusion experiments showed that the enzyme had a functional signal peptide. The B. fibrisolvens amylase is a calcium metalloenzyme, and three conserved putative calcium-binding residues were identified. The amylase showed high sequence homology with other alpha-amylases in the three highly conserved regions which constitute the active centers. These and other conserved regions were located in the N-terminal half, and no similarity with any other amylase was detected in the remainder of the protein. Deletion of approximately 40% of the C-terminal portion of the amylase did not result in loss of amylolytic activity. The B. fibrisolvens amylase was identified as an endo-alpha-amylase by hydrolysis of the Phadebas amylase substrate, hydrolysis of gamma-cyclodextrin to maltotriose, maltose, and glucose and the characteristic shape of the blue value and reducing sugar curves. Maltotriose was the major initial hydrolysis product from starch, although extended incubation resulted in its hydrolysis to maltose and glucose.
TI  - Sequencing and expression of the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens xylB gene encoding a novel bifunctional protein with beta-D-xylosidase and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase activities.
AB  - A single gene (xylB) encoding both beta-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) and alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase (EC 3.2.1.55) activities was identified and sequenced from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. The xylB gene consists of a 1.551-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 517 amino acids. A subclone containing a 1.843-bp DNA fragment retained both enzymatic activities. Insertion of a 10-bp NotI linker into the EcoRV site within the central region of this ORF abolished both activities. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cytoplasmic proteins from recombinant Escherichia coli confirmed the presence of a 60,000-molecular-weight protein in active subclones and the absence of this protein in subclones lacking activity. With p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xylopyranoside and p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside as substrates, the specific activity of arabinosidase was found to be approximately 1.6-fold higher than that of xylosidase. The deduced amino acid sequence of the xylB gene product did not exhibit a high degree of identity with other xylan-degrading enzymes or glycosidases. The xylB gene was located between two incomplete ORFs within the 4,200-bp region which was sequenced. No sequences resembling terminators were found within this region, and these three genes are proposed to be part of a single operon. Based on comparison with other glycosidases, a conserved region was identified in the carboxyl end of the translated xylB gene which is similar to that of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the celA gene encoding endoglucanase A of Butyrivibrio  fibrisolvens strain A46.
AB  - Genomic DNA from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strain A46 was digested with EcoRI and ligated into lambda gt11. Two recombinant phages isolated from the gene bank hydrolysed carboxymethylcellulose and were shown to contain the same 2.3 kb EcoRI restriction fragment, which was cloned into pUC12 to generate pBA46. Escherichia coli JM83 harbouring pBA46 expressed an endoglucanase (EGA) which hydrolysed a range of other substrates including barley beta-glucan, Avicel, filter paper and p-nitrophenyl beta-D-cellobioside. Nucleotide sequencing of the B. fibrisolvens strain A46 DNA cloned in pBA46 revealed a single open reading frame (ORF) of 1296 bp, encoding a protein of 48,863 Da. Confirmation that the ORF coded for EGA was obtained by comparing the N-terminal sequence of the purified endoglucanase with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. EGA contains a typical prokaryotic signal peptide at its N-terminus and shows some homology with the Bacillus family of cellulases. The enzyme does not contain distinct functional domains, which are prevalent in cellulases from Pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa and Cellulomonas fimi.
TI  - Sequencing and expression of a cellodextrinase (ced1) gene from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c cloned in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.314 kb DNA segment containing a gene (ced1) expressing cellodextrinase activity from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was determined. The B. fibrisolvens H17c gene was expressed from a weak internal promoter in Escherichia coli and a putative consensus promoter sequence was identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and a GTG start codon. The complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology was demonstrated with the Clostridium thermocellum endoglucanase D (EGD), Pseudomonas fluorescens var. cellulosa endoglucanase (EG), and a cellulase from the avocado fruit (Persea americana). The ced1 gene product Ced1 showed cellodextrinase activity and rapidly hydrolysed short-chain cellodextrins to yield either cellobiose or cellobiose and glucose as end products. The Ced1 enzyme released cellobiose from p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside and the enzyme was not inhibited by methylcellulose, an inhibitor of endoglucanase activity. Although the major activity of the Ced1 enzyme was that of a cellodextrinase it also showed limited activity against endoglucanase specific substrates [carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), lichenan, laminarin and xylan]. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with incorporated CMC showed a major activity band with an apparent Mr of approximately 61,000. The calculated Mr of the ced1 gene product was 61,023.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the Ruminococcus albus SY3 endoglucanase genes celA and celB.
AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of Ruminococcus albus genes celA and celB coding for endoglucanase A (EGA) and endoglucanase B (EGB), respectively, have been determined. The celA structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1095 bp. Confirmation of the nucleotide sequence was obtained by comparing the predicted amino acid sequence with that derived by N-terminal analysis of purified EGA. The celB structural gene consists of an open reading frame of 1227 bp; 7 bp upstream of the translational start codon of celB is a typical gram-positive Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The deduced N-terminal region of EGB conforms to the general pattern for the signal peptides of secreted prokaryotic proteins. The complete celB gene, cloned into pUC vectors, caused lethality in Escherichia coli. In contrast, celA cloned in pUC18, under the control of lacZp, directed high-level synthesis of EGA in E. coli JM83. EGA in cell-free extract, purified to near homogeneity by ion-exchange chromatography, had a Mr of 44.5 kDa. Gene deletion and subcloning studies with celA revealed that EGA hydrolysed both CMC and xylan, and did not contain discrete functional domains. EGA and EGB showed considerable homology with each other, in addition to exhibiting similarity with Eg1 (R. albus), EGE (Clostridium thermocellum) and End (Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens).
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and analysis of expression of a Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens gene encoding a beta-glucosidase.
AB  - The cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3.74 kb DNA segment on pLS215 containing a beta-glucosidase gene (bglA) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was investigated. The B. fibrisolvens bglA open reading frame (ORF) of 2490 bp encoded a beta-glucosidase of 830 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 91,800. In Escherichia coli C600(pLS215) cells the beta-glucosidase was localized in the cytoplasm and these cells produced an additional protein with an apparent Mr of approximately 94,000. The bglA gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in E. coli and a single mRNA initiation point was identified upstream of the bglA ORF and adjacent to a promoter consensus sequence. The primary structure of the beta-glucosidase showed greater than 40% similarity with a domain of 237 amino acids present in the beta-glucosidases of Kluyveromyces fragilis and Clostridium thermocellum. The B. fibrisolvens beta-glucosidase hydrolysed cellobiose to a limited extent, cellotriose to cellobiose and glucose, and cellotetraose and cellopentaose to predominantly glucose.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and expression of a xylanase gene from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  - A gene coding for xylanase activity, xynA, from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 was cloned into Escherichia coli JM83 by using plasmid pUC19. The gene was located on a 2.3-kilobase (kb) DNA insert composed of two adjacent EcoRI fragments of 1.65 and 0.65 kb. Expression of xylanase activity required parts of both EcoRI segments. In E. coli, the cloned xylanase enzyme was not secreted and remained cell associated. The enzyme exhibited no arabinosidase, cellulase, alpha-glucosidase, or xylosidase activity. The isoelectric point of the cloned protein was approximately 9.8, and optimal xylanase activity was obtained at pH 5.4. The nucleotide sequence of the 1,535-base-pair EcoRV-EcoRI segment from the B. fibrisolvens chromosome that included the xynA gene was determined. An open reading frame was found that encoded a 411-amino-acid-residue polypeptide of 46,664 daltons. A putative ribosome-binding site, promoter, and leader sequence were identified. Comparison of the XynA protein sequence with that of the XynA protein from alkalophilic Bacillus sp. strain C-125 revealed considerable homology, with 37% identical residues or conservative changes. The presence of the cloned xylanase gene in other strains of Butyrivibrio was examined by Southern hybridization. The cloned xylanase gene hybridized strongly to chromosomal sequences in only two of five closely related strains.
TI  - Antigenic nature of the chloride-stimulated cellobiosidase and other cellulases of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 and related fresh isolates.
AB  - Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to the Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase of Fibrobacter succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85 reacted with numerous proteins of both higher and lower molecular weights from F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes S85, but not with Escherichia coli proteins, and only one protein each from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Ruminococcus albus. Different profiles were observed for Western blots (immunoblots) of peptide digests of both the purified enzyme from F. succinogenes and immunoreactive proteins of higher and lower molecular weights, demonstrating that they were different proteins. Therefore, F. succinogenes appeared to produce numerous proteins with one or more common antigenic determinants. However, with the exception of Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, none were cellulases that have been characterized. An affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase reacted with numerous proteins in cells of each of three fresh isolates of F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes and one of F. succinogenes subsp. elongata when analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies to periplasmic cellodextrinase, endoglucanase 2 (EG2), and EG3, when reacted in Western blots with the various cellulases, including Cl-stimulated cellobiosidase, revealed limited antigenic similarity among the different proteins and none with either B. fibrisolvens or R. albus proteins. The periplasmic cellodextrinase antibody reacted with an antigen with a size corresponding to cellodextrinase in each of the three F. succinogenes subsp. succinogenes isolates but not with any antigens from the F. succinogenes subsp. elongata isolate. The anti-EG2 antibody reacted with single antigens in each of the four isolates, while the anti-EG3 antibody reacted with only one of the four isolates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of an endoglucanase (end1) gene from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a 2.8 kb DNA segment containing an endoglucanase gene  (end1) from Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens H17c was determined. The B. fibrisolvens H17c gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in Escherichia coli and three putative consensus promoter sequences were identified upstream of a ribosome binding site and an ATG start codon. The complete amino acid sequence (547 residues) was deduced and homology with the Clostridium thermocellum celE gene product (EGE) was demonstrated. The endoglucanase contained a typical amino-terminal signal sequence and five repeated sequences (PDPTPVD) between amino acids 412-447. The endoglucanase showed relatively high endoglucanase activity against endoglucanase-specific substrates with beta 1-4 linkages but low activity against xylan and an exoglucanase-specific substrate, p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-cellobioside.
TI  - Identification of the Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens xylosidase gene (xylB) coding region and its expression in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The gene encoding the principal Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens xylosidase (xylB) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter. The coding region for this gene was localized within a 3.2-kilobase B. fibrisolvens DNA fragment in pUC18. A new protein band was observed in recombinant E. coli containing xylB. This protein (approximately 60,000 molecular weight) was presumed to be the xylosidase monomer. The optimal pH (5.5) and substrate range for the recombinant and native xylosidases appeared identical. Both enzymes hydrolyzed xylo-oligosaccharides with chain lengths of 2 to 5 and both were inactive on xylan.
TI  - Molybdate and sulfide inhibit H2 and increase formate production from glucose by  Ruminococcus albus.
AB  - H2 production from glucose by Ruminococcus albus was almost completely inhibited  by 10(-5) M molybdate only when sulfide was present in the growth medium. Inhibition was accompanied by a significant increase in the production of formate. Extracts of molybdate-sulfide-grown cells did not contain hydrogenase activity. Active enzyme in extracts of uninhibited cells was not inhibited by the molybdate-sulfide-containing growth medium. The results indicate that a complex formed from molybdate and sulfide prevents the formation of active hydrogenase and electrons otherwise used to form H2 are used to reduce CO2 to formate. Growth was significantly inhibited when molybdate was increased to 10(-4) M. Reversal of growth inhibition but not inhibition of H2 production occurred between 10(-4) and 10(-3) M molybdate. H2 production by R. bromei but not by R. flavefaciens, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Veillonella alcalescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli was inhibited by molybdate and sulfide.
TI  - Studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: Bacteroides clostridiiformis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Enbacterium limosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Clostridium pasteurianum and Escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. Hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. All species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only C. pasteurianum, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii produced hydrogen from dithionite. All species except E. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but activity was low or absent in extracts of E. limosum, F. necrophorum, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. Hydrogen was produced from formate only by E. coli, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, F. necrophorum, and R. flavefaciens. Extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. The hydrogenase of all species except E. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. Treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with DEAE-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. Activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. It is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
TI  - The biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  - 1. alpha-[U-(14)C]Linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. A tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. The main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. Washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. Pure cultures of Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.
