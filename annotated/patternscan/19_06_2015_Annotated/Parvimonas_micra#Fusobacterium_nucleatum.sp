TI  == quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  == background: complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated  species without early colonizers of dental plaque. the aim: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus and fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. after incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures  were harvested, dna extracted and the target species quantified using qpcr with species-specific 16s rdna primers. biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized  at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. results: the six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. in multispecies biofilm, p. gingivalis qpcr counts  (cells/ml) increased (p<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (p<0.05) than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm,  p. gingivalis counts were lower (p<0.05) than those of the other species, except  a. actinomycetemcomitans. when multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, p. gingivalis counts were higher (p<0.05) but those of the other species, except p. intermedia, lower (p<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  micra and c. rectus had higher (p<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. conclusions: six periodontal  species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. p. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas p. micra and a. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.

TI  == microbiota at teeth and implants in partially edentulous patients. a 10-year retrospective study.
AB  == objective: to determine the microbiota at implants and adjacent teeth 10 years after placement of implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched surface. material  and methods: plaque samples obtained from the deepest sites of 504 implants and of 493 adjacent teeth were analyzed for certain bacterial species associated with periodontitis, for staphylococci, for aerobic gram-negative rods, and for yeasts  using nucleic acid-based methods. results: species known to be associated with periodontitis were detectable at 6.2-78.4% of the implants. significantly higher  counts at implants in comparison with teeth were assessed for tannerella forsythia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, and campylobacter rectus. higher counts of periodontopathogenic species were detectable at implants of current smokers than at those of non-smokers. in addition, those species were found in higher quantities at implants of subjects with periodontitis. the prevalence of prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, c. rectus, and moreover of staphylococcus warneri might be associated with peri-implant inflammation. selected staphylococcal species (not staphylococcus aureus), aerobic gram-negative rods, and yeasts were frequently detected, but with the exception of s. warneri, they did not show any association with periodontal or peri-implant diseases. conclusions: smoking and periodontal disease are risk factors for colonization of periodontopathic bacteria at implants. those bacterial species may play a potential role in peri-implant inflammation. the role of s. warneri needs further validation.

TI  == short-chain fatty acids in infected root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis before and after treatment.
AB  == introduction: short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are bacterial metabolic end products that may function as virulence factors. this study evaluated the occurrence of scfas in infected root canals before and after treatment. methods:  samples were taken from root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis before (s1) and after (s2) chemomechanical preparation with either naocl or chlorhexidine as the irrigant and then after interappointment medication with calcium hydroxide (s3). high-performance liquid chromatography was used for detection of scfas. selected bacterial taxa that are recognized producers of the  target scfas were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: butyric acid was the most common fatty acid in s1, followed by propionic acid. both molecules were also found in s2 and s3 from both naocl and chlorhexidine groups. lactic acid was not present in detectable levels in s1, but it occurred in 1 postinstrumentation sample and in 9 samples taken after calcium hydroxide medication. of the target taxa, fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent in s1 (76%), followed by members of the actinobacteria phylum (71%), streptococcus species (59%), and parvimonas micra (53%). gram-positive taxa, especially streptococci, were the most prevalent bacteria in s2 and s3. scfa detection was matched with the respective potential producer species in most cases. conclusions: this first report of scfas in infected root canals suggests that these molecules may play a role in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. significance of persistence of scfas after treatment and its effects on the long-term outcome await elucidation.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == hydrogen sulfide production from subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial anaerobe infection. little is known about the dysbiotic microbiota and the role of bacterial metabolites in the disease process. it is suggested that the production of certain waste products in the proteolytic metabolism may work as markers for disease severity. hydrogen sulfide (h2s) is a gas produced by degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket. it  is highly toxic and believed to have pro-inflammatory properties. we aimed to study h2s production from subgingival plaque samples in relation to disease severity in subjects with natural development of the disease, using a colorimetric method based on bismuth precipitation. in remote areas of northern thailand, adults with poor oral hygiene habits and a natural development of periodontal disease were examined for their oral health status. h2s production was measured with the bismuth method and subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for the presence of 20 bacterial species with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. in total, 43 subjects were examined (age 40-60 years, mean pi 95 +/- 6.6%). fifty-six percent had moderate periodontal breakdown (cal > 3 < 7 mm) and 35% had severe periodontal breakdown (cal > 7 mm) on at least one site. parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were frequently detected. h2s production could not be correlated to periodontal disease severity (ppd or cal at sampled sites) or to a  specific bacterial composition. site 21 had statistically lower production of h2s (p = 0.02) compared to 16 and 46. betel nut chewers had statistically significant lower h2s production (p = 0.01) than non-chewers. rapid detection and estimation  of subgingival h2s production capacity was easily and reliably tested by the colorimetric bismuth sulfide precipitation method. h2s may be a valuable clinical marker for degradation of proteins in the subgingival pocket.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == high-level antimicrobial efficacy of representative mediterranean natural plant extracts against oral microorganisms.
AB  == nature is an unexplored reservoir of novel phytopharmaceuticals. since biofilm-related oral diseases often correlate with antibiotic resistance, plant-derived antimicrobial agents could enhance existing treatment options. therefore, the rationale of the present report was to examine the antimicrobial impact of mediterranean natural extracts on oral microorganisms. five different extracts from olea europaea, mastic gum, and inula viscosa were tested against ten bacteria and one candida albicans strain. the extraction protocols were conducted according to established experimental procedures. two antimicrobial assays--the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) assay--were applied. the screened extracts were  found to be active against each of the tested microorganisms. o. europaea presented mic and mbc ranges of 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.60-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. the mean mbc values for mastic gum and i. viscosa were 0.07-10.00 mg ml(-1) and 0.15-10.00 mg ml(-1), respectively. extracts were less effective against c. albicans and exerted bactericidal effects at a concentration range of  0.07-5.00 mg ml(-1) on strict anaerobic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and parvimonas micra). ethyl acetate i. viscosa extract and total mastic extract showed considerable antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms and could therefore be considered as alternative natural anti-infectious agents.

TI  == pathogenic bacterial species associated with endodontic infection evade innate immune control by disabling neutrophils.
AB  == endodontic infections, in which oral bacteria access the tooth pulp chamber, are  common and do not resolve once established. to investigate the effects of these infections on the innate immune response, we established a mouse subcutaneous chamber model, where a mixture of four oral pathogens commonly associated with these infections (endodontic pathogens [ep]), i.e., fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus intermedius, parvimonas micra, and prevotella intermedia, was inoculated into subcutaneously implanted titanium chambers. cells that infiltrated the chamber after these infections were primarily neutrophils; however, these neutrophils were unable to control the infection. infection with a nonpathogenic oral bacterial species, streptococcus mitis, resulted in well-controlled infection, with bacterial numbers reduced by 4 to 5 log units after 7 days. propidium iodide (pi) staining of the chamber neutrophils identified three distinct populations: neutrophils from ep-infected chambers were intermediate in pi staining, while cells in chambers from mice infected with s. mitis were pi positive (apoptotic) or negative (live). strikingly, neutrophils from ep-infected chambers were severely impaired in their ability to phagocytose  and to generate reactive oxygen species in vitro after removal from the chamber compared to cells from s. mitis-infected chambers. the mechanism of neutrophil impairment was necrotic cell death as determined by morphological analyses. p. intermedia alone could induce a similar neutrophil phenotype. we conclude that the endodontic pathogens, particularly p. intermedia, can efficiently disable and kill infiltrating neutrophils, allowing these infections to become established. these results can help explain the persistence of endodontic infections and demonstrate a new virulence mechanism associated with p. intermedia.

TI  == microbial evaluation of traumatized teeth treated with triple antibiotic paste or calcium hydroxide with 2% chlorhexidine gel in pulp revascularization.
AB  == introduction: revascularization outcome depends on microbial elimination because  apical repair will not happen in the presence of infected tissues. this study evaluated the microbial composition of traumatized immature teeth and assessed their reduction during different stages of the revascularization procedures performed with 2 intracanal medicaments. methods: fifteen patients (7-17 years old) with immature teeth were submitted to the revascularization procedures; they were divided into 2 groups according to the intracanal medicament used: tap group (n = 7), medicated with a triple antibiotic paste, and chp group (n = 8), dressed with calcium hydroxide + 2% chlorhexidine gel. samples were taken before any treatment (s1), after irrigation with 6% naocl (s2), after irrigation with 2% chlorhexidine (s3), after intracanal dressing (s4), and after 17% edta irrigation (s5). cultivable bacteria recovered from the 5 stages were counted and identified by means of polymerase chain reaction assay (16s rrna). results: both groups had  colony-forming unit counts significantly reduced after s2 (p < .05); however, no  significant difference was found between the irrigants (s2 and s3, p = .99). no difference in bacteria counts was found between the intracanal medicaments used (p = .95). the most prevalent bacteria detected were actinomyces naeslundii (66.67%), followed by porphyromonas endodontalis, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum, which were detected in 33.34% of the root canals. an average of 2.13 species per canal was found, and no statistical correlation was observed between bacterial species and clinical/radiographic features. conclusions: the microbial profile of infected immature teeth is similar to that  of primarily infected permanent teeth. the greatest bacterial reduction was promoted by the irrigation solutions. the revascularization protocols that used the tested intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing viable bacteria in necrotic immature teeth.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == oral cavity anaerobic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.
AB  == background: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. the purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. methods: biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species  detected in microcolonies. the other microbes (parvimonas micra [p. micra], porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia], and treponema denticola [t. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. clsm analysis showed that f. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. conclusion: although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no  more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.

TI  == signaling pathways activation by primary endodontic infectious contents and production of inflammatory mediators.
AB  == introduction: this study investigated the bacterial community involved in primary endodontic diseases, evaluated its ability to activate the macrophage toll-like receptor 4 receptor through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and nuclear factor kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways, and determined the levels  of endotoxins and interleukins (interleukin [il]-6 and -10) produced by endodontic content-stimulated macrophages. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals by using sterile/apyrogenic paper points. raw 264.7 macrophages were  stimulated with root canal contents. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was used  for bacterial analysis and the limulus amebocyte lysate assay for endotoxin measurement; p38 mapk and nf-kappab activation was determined by western blot analysis. il-6 and il-10 were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: bacteria and endotoxins were detected in 100% of the samples (21/21). the most frequently observed species were parvimonas micra (16/21, 76%), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum (15/21, 71%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (14/21, 66%). correlations were found between endotoxins and il-6 and il-10 (p < .05); p38 phosphorylation had a peak at 60 minutes, and nf-kappab  was quickly activated after 10 minutes of stimulation. conclusions: it was concluded that the complex bacterial community was shown to be a potent activator of tlr-4 determined by the p38 mapk and nf-kappab signaling pathways, culminating in a high antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of il-6 and il-10,  all significantly affected by endotoxin levels.

TI  == preservation of bacterial dna by human dentin.
AB  == introduction: the capacity of dentin and collagen to bind dna and protect against spontaneous and nuclease-induced degradation was evaluated individually and by the incubation of dna with nuclease-producing bacteria in a mixed culture. methods: extracted fusobacterium nucleatum dna was incubated with dentin shavings or collagen for 90 minutes. the dna-bound substrates were incubated in different  media (water, sera, and dnase i) for up to 3 months. amplifiable dna was released from dentin using edta,or from collagen using proteinase k, and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the stability of dentin-bound dna was also assessed in a mixed culture (parvimonas micra and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus) containing a dnase-producing species, prevotella intermedia. samples were analyzed for amplifiable dna. results: in water, dentin-bound dna was recoverable by pcr at 3 months compared with no detectable dna after 4 weeks in controls (no  dentin). dna bound to collagen was detectable by pcr after 3 months of incubation in water. in 10% human sera, amplifiable dna was detectable at 3 months when dentin bound and in controls (no dentin). in mixed bacterial culture, dentin-bound dna was recoverable throughout the experimental period (3 months), compared with no recoverable f. nucleatum dna within 24 hours in controls (no dentin). conclusions: there is a strong binding affinity between dna and dentin,  and between dna and serum proteins or collagen. these substrates preserve dna against natural decomposition and protect dna from nuclease activity, factors that may confound molecular analysis of the endodontic microbiota yet favor paleomicrobiological studies of ancient dna.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == comparative evaluation of subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and non-pregnant women: a clinical and microbiologic study.
AB  == context: gingival changes in pregnancy have been attributed to changes in the subgingival biofilm related to hormonal variations. aims: to evaluate the subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and nonpregnant women to determine if pregnancy induces any alterations in the subgingival plaque and to associate these changes with changes in periodontal status. settings and design: thirty pregnant and 10 nonpregnant women within the age group of 20-35 years having a probing pocket depth (ppd) of 3-4 mm were included in the study. the pregnant women were equally divided into 3 groups of 10, each belonging to i, ii, and iii  trimester. materials and methods: plaque index, gingival index, ppd, and microbiologic evaluation for specific bacterial counts for prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum were carried out for all subjects. statistical analysis: mann-whitney u test. results: increase in gingival inflammation was observed in ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and control. plaque scores did not show any significant difference between pregnant and nonpregnant women. specific bacterial examination revealed an increase in proportion of p. intermedia in pregnant women of both ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and nonpregnant women. conclusions: a definite increase in proportions  of p. intermedia occurs in subgingival plaque microflora in pregnancy that may be responsible for the exaggerated gingival response.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == presence of oral bacterial species in primary endodontic infections of primary teeth.
AB  == objective: knowledge of the microbial composition of deciduous endodontic infections is limited. this study aimed to evaluate the presence of the 10 oral bacterial species in samples from primary tooth root canals by using microarray technology and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical conditions. study design: the samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with primer infection. the bacterial composition of the samples was semi-quantitatively defined using a microarray system (parocheck). results: all the tested species were detected in the samples. fusobacterium nucleatum was the  most frequently isolated bacterium (96.7%), followed by prevotella intermedia (86.7%), parvimonas micra (83.3%), treponema denticola (76.7%) and tannerella forsythia (66.7%). these bacteria were also present in high levels. all pairs of  bacterial species were positively associated (rr > 1), except pintermedia and p > micra. on average, five species (range:3-8) were detected per amplified sample. root canals of teeth with > 5 different species were statistically associated with periapical radiolucency (p = 0.049). conclusions: primary teeth with endodontic infections show a highly diverse variety of bacteria, in which the most prevalent specie are present in high proportions. the well-directed use of the improved microarray technology will provide additional valuable information for causative factors associated with endodontic diseases, helping to develop more successful antibacterial or anti-inflammatory treatment strategies.

TI  == microbiological profile and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of infected root canals associated with periapical abscesses.
AB  == the aim of this investigation was to identify microorganisms from root canals with periapical abscesses and assess the susceptibility of specific anaerobic bacteria to selected antimicrobials and their beta-lactamase production. sixty root canals were microbiologically investigated. the susceptibility of anaerococcus prevotii, fusobacterium necrophorum, f. nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and prevotella intermedia/nigrescens to antimicrobials was evaluated with the etest, whereas beta-lactamase production was assessed with nitrocefin. a total of 287 different bacterial strains were recovered, including 201 strict anaerobes. the most frequently strict isolated anaerobes were a. prevotii, p. micra, and f.  necrophorum. the selected bacteria were susceptible to all the tested antibiotics, except a. prevotii and fusobacterium species to azithromycin and erythromycin, as well as a. prevotii and f. necrophorum to metronidazole. none of the microorganisms produced beta-lactamase. gram-positive anaerobic bacteria predominated in the root canals with periapical abscesses. all microorganisms tested were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanate, cefaclor, and clindamycin, producing no beta-lactamase.

TI  == antibacterial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine containing points against fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra.
AB  == objective: up to 90% of the flora of an infected root canal consists of obligate  anaerobic bacteria. however, most studies have centred on microaerophiles. this quantitative assay investigated the antibacterial effects against fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra of gutta-percha (gp) points containing either calcium hydroxide (ca(oh)(2)) or chlorhexidine (chx) compared to those of conventional gp points. methods: standardized root canals were prepared in 192 bovine incisors. the canals were sterilized and then inoculated with one of two bacterial species (n=96 teeth per bacterium). after anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees c, the inoculum was removed and the canals were filled with one of the three points. control teeth were filled with a saline/serum mixture. after 0, 1,  4 and 8 days of anaerobic incubation, the numbers of viable bacteria (cfu/ml) were determined on both the points and the canal wall dentin. six replicates were carried out for each experiment. results: none of the points completely eradicated the bacteria in the canal. gp+chx was significantly more effective than gp+ca(oh)(2) and gp (p<.05 in each case). the inhibitory effect of gp+ca(oh)(2) did not significantly differ from that of gp (p>.05). compared to the controls, the antibacterial effect of the medicated points was reached initially. conclusion: within the limitations of the in vitro model, the incorporation of commonly used medicaments in gp does not offer a long-lasting antibacterial advantage over non-medicated gp.

TI  == microbial diversity in failed endodontic root-filled teeth.
AB  == background: persistent/secondary infections of human root canals play an important role in the failure of endodontic treatment. this study used 16s rrna sequencing to assess microbial diversity in root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. methods: dna was extracted from 15 teeth with persistent intraradicular infections, and the 16s rrna of all present bacteria were amplified by pcr, followed by cloning and sequencing of the 16s rrna amplicons. results: all sample extracts were positive for pcr amplification using the universal 16s rrna gene primers. negative control reactions yielded no amplicons. sixty-five phylotypes belonging to seven phyla were identified from 760 clones; a mean of 9.4 phylotypes were detected in each sample (range 3 - 15). twenty-eight phylotypes were detected in more than one sample, revealing a high inter-sample variability. parvimonas micra (60%, 9/15), solobacterium moore (47%, 7/15), dialister invisus (33%, 5/15), enterococcus faecalis (33%, 5/15), filifactor alocis (27%, 4/15), and fusobacterium nucleatum (27%, 4/15) were the prevalent species. nineteen as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were identified, comprising a substantial proportion of the bacteria in many cases. conclusions: persistent intraradicular infections were present in all root-filled teeth associated with failed endodontic treatment. the current observations reveal new  candidate endodontic pathogens, including as-yet-uncultivated bacteria and phylotypes that may participate in the mixed infections associated with post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  == treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. the ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. in this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of t. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and parvimonas micra. proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (msp) was not necessary, except for binding parv. micra. biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between t. denticola and p. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with t. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. expression of ctlp, but not msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with p. gingivalis. t. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. synergy between t. denticola and p. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was ctlp-dependent. the results demonstrate the critical role of ctlp in interactions of t. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == investigation of six selected bacterial species in endo-periodontal lesions.
AB  == aim: to investigate and determine possible associations of six tested bacteria belonging to 'orange' and 'green' complexes, in endo-periodontal lesions: parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens and capnocytophaga sputigena. methodology: forty-six patients presenting with different types of endo-periodontal lesions were investigated. clinical examinations, periapical radiographs and microbiological sampling from the canal system (endo) and periodontal pockets (perio) were performed. qualitative and semiquantitative evaluation of bacteria was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and dna-dna hybridization (micro-ident plus; hain lifescience, germany). results: extremely high bacterial loads in endodontic samples were recorded for p. micra, f. nucleatum and c. sputigena, while periodontal samples were often colonized by the same species, plus c. rectus. significant association was recorded between f. nucleatum-endo and p. micra-endo  (p = 0.03, fisher's exact test). there was marginal evidence of associations between: (i) c. sputigena-endo and c. sputigena-perio (p = 0.06, fisher's exact test); (ii) p. micra-endo and p. micra-perio (p = 0.05, fisher's exact test). sensitivity to percussion was associated with an increased chance of cases with p. micra-endo (p = 0.03, pearson chi-square test). conclusion: the findings suggest that f. nucleatum, p. micra and c. sputigena may play a role in the pathogenesis of endo-periodontal lesions.

TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == tongue piercing: the effect of material on microbiological findings.
AB  == purpose: biofilms on oral piercings may serve as a bacterial reservoir and lead to systemic bacteremia or local transmission of pathogenic microbiota. the use of piercing materials which are less susceptible to biofilm accumulation could contribute to prevention of problems. the present study investigated whether there are microbiological differences in bacterial samples collected from tongue  piercings made of different materials. methods: a total of 85 subjects with tongue piercings participated in this study. after a baseline dental examination, sterile piercings of four different materials were randomly allocated to the study subjects. after 2 weeks, microbiologic samples were collected and processed by checkerboard deoxyribonucleic acid- deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization methods. results: about 28.8% of subjects reported 61 lingual recessions (1.91 +/- .96 mm), whereas 5% reported tooth chipping on one tooth each. with the exception of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (y4), fusobacterium nucleatum  species, and parvimonas micra, bacteria associated with periodontitis were not commonly found in the samples from studs or piercing channels. of the 80 bacterial species, 67 were found at significantly higher levels (p < .001) in samples from stainless steel than from polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene piercings. conclusion: the low bacterial counts from piercing channels suggest that having a tongue pierced would not contribute to an increased risk for oral infection. the present study demonstrated that studs made of steel might promote  the development of a biofilm, whereas those made of polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene may be rather inert to bacterial colonization. the finding of staphylococci on steel and titanium studs may suggest an elevated risk for complication if the piercing channel is infected.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. materials and methods: nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces israelii, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus sanguinis were tested on ti surfaces: pretreatment (pt [r(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (a [r(a) <0.8 mum]), a modified to be hydrophilic (moda), sand-blasted/acid-etched (sla [r(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic sla (modsla). disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (cm) or human saliva (hs). the total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with cm compared with the samples incubated with hs. pt, sla, and modsla exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in cm, whereas sla and modsla had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in hs. the proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: sla and modsla increased the proportion of species like a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of a. israelii and p. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. conclusions: the initial biofilm formation and composition were affected  by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == methods for optimizing dna extraction before quantifying oral bacterial numbers by real-time pcr.
AB  == methods for the optimal extraction of genomic dna for real-time pcr enumeration of oral bacteria using the muramidase, mutanolysin, were developed using a simple in vitro oral flora model comprised of the facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans, the gram-positive anaerobe, parvimonas micra, and the gram-negative anaerobes, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica and fusobacterium nucleatum. traditional, as well as more elaborate, methods of quantifying bacterial numbers, including colony counting and estimation of dna content using 4',6-diamino-2-phenylindole were compared in order to validate the real-time pcr approach. evidence was obtained that p. gingivalis nuclease activity adversely affected the extraction of double-stranded dna from this bacterium either alone or when it formed part of a consortium with the other bacteria. this nuclease activity could be overcome by treatment of the bacteria with either 20 mm diethyl pyrocarbonate or 70% ethanol  at 4 degrees c overnight. a final purification of the dna to remove any potential pcr inhibitors was added to the protocol in order to accurately quantify the amount of dna by real-time pcr and hence the number of bacteria in a sample.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == the microbiota of acute apical abscesses.
AB  == as the breadth of bacterial diversity in the oral cavity has been deciphered by molecular studies, several newly identified species/phylotypes have emerged as potential pathogens. we hypothesized that many of these species/phylotypes could  also be involved with the etiology of endodontic abscesses. abscess aspirates from 42 persons were analyzed for the presence of 81 species/phylotypes by means  of a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. associations between the most frequently detected taxa were calculated. the most prevalent taxa were fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, and porphyromonas endodontalis. other  frequently found taxa included olsenella uli, streptococci, eikenella corrodens,  some as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes (bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121), and newly named species (prevotella baroniae and dialister invisus). several positive bacterial associations were disclosed. findings not only strengthen the association of many cultivable species with abscesses, but also include some newly named species and uncultivated phylotypes in the set of candidate pathogens associated with this disease.

TI  == short-term clinical and microbiological evaluations of peri-implant diseases before and after mechanical anti-infective therapies.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of mechanical anti-infective therapies for mucositis and  peri-implantitis. material and methods: subjects with at least one dental implant were assigned to healthy (n=10), mucositis (n=12) or peri-implantitis (n=13) groups. implants with mucositis or peri-implantitis were decontaminated by means  of teflon curettes and abrasive sodium carbonate air-powder, performed by an open flap for peri-implantitis and without surgery for mucositis. visible plaque (pi), marginal bleeding (mb), bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration (sup), probing depth (pd) and relative clinical attachment level (rcal) were assessed at baseline and at 3 months after therapies. at the same time points, submucosal plaque samples were collected from each implant and analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for 40 bacterial species. results: all clinical parameters  improved at 3 months post-therapy in mucositis and peri-implantitis groups (p<0.05). the mean reduction in rcal (+/-sd) was 1.4+/-1.2 mm and 2.3+/-1.6 mm, and it was 1.3+/-1.2 mm and 3.1+/-1.7 mm in pd (+/-sd) for mucositis and peri-implantitis, respectively. levels of treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and parvimonas micra, and of fusobacterium nucleatum ss nucleatum, were significantly reduced after peri-implantitis therapy and after mucositis therapy, respectively (p<0.05). in addition, counts of porphyromons gingivalis, treponema  socranskii and the proportions of red complex were reduced in both groups at 3 months after treatments (p<0.05). conclusion: mechanical therapies alone were effective in treating mucositis and peri-implantitis over a period of 3 months. the open debridement procedure showed clinical and microbiological benefits on the treatment of peri-implantitis and could be safely used as a standard control  group for future studies.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.
