TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == bacterial profiles of oral streptococcal and periodontal bacterial species in saliva specimens from japanese subjects.
AB  == objective: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have increased  understanding of the distribution of oral bacterial species in clinical specimens, though few investigations have been conducted to simultaneously detect oral streptococcal and periodontal species in the same specimens. the purpose of  the present study was to investigate the distribution and correlation of 6 oral streptococcal and 6 periodontal species in saliva specimens taken from children and their mothers. design: seventy-four pairs of children and their mothers were  approved to participate in this study. saliva specimens were collected and bacterial dna extracted, which was subjected to pcr analyses using species-specific sets of primers. the combinations of species able to be detected simultaneously were determined by statistical analyses. results: streptococcus sobrinus and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected more often in the mothers than the children. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus oralis were detected simultaneously in a significant number of specimens, while the presence of campylobacter rectus was correlated with the presence of at least one of the red complex species (p. gingivalis, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythensis). on the other hand, no correlation was shown between the rates of detection of oral streptococcal and periodontal species. conclusions: our results indicate that among streptococcal and periodontal species, several are able to coexist in saliva, while the presence of both does not have an influence on each other.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from human neutrophils.
AB  == aim: the induction of tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils by periodontopathic bacteria has been suggested as one of the mechanisms of periodontal destruction. the aim of this study was to determine whether the ability to stimulate neutrophils is an authentic characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we evaluated, along with phagocytosis, the production of reactive oxygen species (ros), matrix metalloproteinase-8 (mmp-8),  and interleukin-1beta by neutrophils in response to non-periodontopathic streptococcus sanguinis and periodontopathic bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola, in the absence or presence of antibodies. phagocytosis, the  death of neutrophils, and intracellular ros production were measured by flow cytometry and the concentrations of mmp-8 and interleukin-1beta secreted into medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: s. sanguinis and f. nucleatum induced greater production of ros, mmp-8, and interleukin-1beta than did t. denticola. the levels of tissue-destructive molecules produced by neutrophils had a positive correlation with phagocytosis. opsonization of bacteria with antibodies significantly increased phagocytosis and ros production and release, thus increasing both bacterial clearance and potential tissue damage. conclusion: the ability of oral bacteria to induce tissue-destructive molecules from neutrophils is not an inherent characteristic of periodontopathic bacteria, which would provide a new insight into the role of  neutrophils in periodontal destruction.

TI  == comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == the microbiological profiles of saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque and  dental caries in adults with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == introduction: the relationships between suspected bacteria in saliva, yeasts in oral rinse, and supragingival and subgingival plaque versus root surface and coronal caries in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a non-diabetic group were explored. methods: one-hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 non-diabetic subjects were recruited; their periodontal status, plaque index  and magnitude of root surface and coronal caries were assessed. saliva and an oral rinse were cultured for mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts. toothbrush samples of supragingival plaque and curette samples of subgingival plaque were assessed for 17 bacterial species using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: type 2 diabetes patients had significantly more severe periodontitis, a higher plaque index and a higher prevalence and magnitude of root surface caries than non-diabetic subjects. significantly more diabetic subjects had higher levels of treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus intermedius in their supragingival plaque than non-diabetic subjects. no significant difference  was found for the organisms in saliva, oral rinse and subgingival plaque between  the two groups. after adjustment for diabetic status, root surface caries was associated with an increased count of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva and of streptococcus mutans in supragingival plaque samples. coronal caries was only associated with lactobacilli and yeasts in saliva. conclusion: the number of cariogenic organisms in saliva and oral rinse estimated by culture demonstrated a stronger association with both root surface and coronal caries compared to those 17 species assessed with the checkerboard method in supragingival and subgingival plaque.

TI  == bacterial profile and burden of periodontal infection in subjects with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontitis has been identified as a potential risk factor in cardiovascular diseases. it is possible that the stimulation of host responses to oral infections may result in vascular damage and the inducement of blood clotting. the aim of this study was to assess the role of periodontal infection and bacterial burden as an explanatory variable to the activation of the inflammatory process leading to acute coronary syndrome (acs). methods: a total of 161 consecutive surviving cases admitted with a diagnosis of acs and 161 control subjects, matched with cases according to their gender, socioeconomic level, and smoking status, were studied. serum white blood cell (wbc) counts, high- and low-density lipoprotein (hdl/ldl) levels, high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsc-rp) levels, and clinical periodontal routine parameters were studied. the subgingival pathogens were assayed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: total oral bacterial load was higher in the subjects with acs (mean difference: 17.4x10(5); sd: 10.8; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.2 to 17.4; p<0.001), and significant for 26 of 40 species including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. serum wbc counts, hsc-rp levels, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis,  were explanatory factors to acute coronary syndrome status (nagelkerke r2=0.49).  conclusion: the oral bacterial load of s. intermedius, s. sanguis, streptococcus  anginosus, t. forsythensis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis may be concomitant risk factors in the development of acs.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == is pre-term labour associated with periodontitis in a danish maternity ward?
AB  == objectives: to reveal differences in periodontal status and presence of subgingival bacteria in a scandinavian population of women with pre-term birth compared with women who delivered at term. materials and methods: twenty-one women with pre-term labour (before week 35) and 33 women with term labour (between weeks 38 and 41) were included in this case-control study. periodontal measurements included plaque index (pli), probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop). inter-proximal distances from the cemento-enamel junction (cej) to the marginal bone crest (mbc) were measured on bitewing radiographs. in 31 patients (16 cases and 15 controls) the subgingival plaque was analysed using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization. results: differences between the two examined groups were found related to "twin births" (p=0.0064) and "smokers" (p=0.03). none of the periodontal measurements showed any association. significant differences were found concerning presence of tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and capnocytophaga ochracea but when defining sites with >10(5) bacteria as heavily colonized, no statistical difference was found between the two groups. conclusion: a relation between pre-term birth and periodontitis was not revealed in the present study.

TI  == effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  == objectives: to assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. material and methods:  in the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated  moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. all four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a  day for one minute during a four-week test period. before and after the trial period, plaque indices (pii, silness and loe, 1964) and gingival indices (gi, loe and silness, 1963) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from  all patients at baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. these samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: as a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean pii at baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean pii at four weeks. no statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean gi at baseline and at four weeks. the microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2  and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. a. actinomyctemcomitans p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola. over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. in groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including s. mitis, s. intermedius, and s. sanguis (p < 0.01)  suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated  bacteria. conclusion: one minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. however, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. running head: effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

AB  == objective: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions  of 39 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples after scaling and root planing (srp) alone or in combination with systemic metronidazole and/or professional cleaning in subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: forty-four adult subjects (mean age 45+/-6 years) with periodontitis were randomly assigned  in four treatment groups, a control (c, n=10) that received srp and placebo and three test groups treated as follows: t1 (n=12): srp and metronidazole (m, 400 mg tid) for 10 days; t2 (n=12): srp, weekly professional supragingival plaque removal for 3 months (pc) and placebo; and t3 (n=10): srp, m and pc. subgingival  plaque samples were taken from seven sites per subject at baseline and 90 days post-therapy. counts of 39 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and among groups using ancova. results: the mean counts of the majority of the species were reduced post-therapy in the 4 treatment groups. counts (x 10(5)+/-sem) of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella  forsythensis and treponema denticola were significantly reduced in groups t2 and  t3. levels of beneficial species, such as some actinomyces species, veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii were minimally affected in levels when the combined therapy was applied (t3). mean proportions of red complex species decreased from 18.4% at baseline to 3% at 90 days post-therapy in group t3 (p<0.01), from 25.8% to 2.3% in group t2 (p<0.01), from 17.7% to 5.6% in group t1 (p<0.05) and from 19.4% to 8.8% in group c (ns). proportions of the suspected periodontal pathogens from the orange complex were also markedly reduced in groups t2 and t3. conclusions: all treatments reduced counts and proportions of red complex species. adjunctive therapy appeared to have a greater effect and also affected members of the orange complex.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == epithelial cell response to challenge of bacterial lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharides in vitro.
AB  == accumulating dental plaque at the gingival margin contains lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from the cell walls of gram-positive bacteria. in subgingival plaque associated with periodontal disease the amount of lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria increases. as the gingival junctional epithelium (je) is an important structural and functional tissue, participating in the first line defence against apical advancement of dental plaque, this study examined the direct effects of ltas (from streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis) and lpss (from  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and escherichia coli) on two epithelial cell lines (hacat and erm) and  a culture model for human je. the cells were exposed to the ltas or lpss (10-50 microg/ml) for variable periods of time. none of the bacterial surface components had any effect on primary adhesion or on the epithelial attachment of the je cultures. however, cell growth and mitotic activity were consistently reduced in  all cultures treated with ltas. in contrast, lpss showed only slight or no effects on cell growth and mitotic activity depending on the epithelial cells used. this suggests that lpss, despite their established role as modulators of inflammation, do not have direct harmful effects - at the concentrations found in dental plaque and gingival crevicular fluid - which would explain the mechanism of epithelial degeneration and detachment from the tooth surface. however, the ltas appear to inhibit the renewal of epithelium and may thus contribute to degeneration of coronal je and subgingival colonisation by periodontal pathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == immunologic profile of juvenile periodontitis. i. lymphocyte blastogenesis and the autologous mixed lymphocyte response.
AB  == studies of blastogenesis of lymphocytes in culture from juvenile periodontitis (jp) patients have been inconclusive. experiments demonstrating differences in lymphocyte blastogenesis to preparations of putative periodontopathogens in jp and phytohaemagglutinin (pha) were performed. variables in the blastogenesis assay system recently reported were controlled which included using a range of cell and activator concentrations, incubation times of 3, 5 and 7 days, conical-bottomed microtest wells and chemical inhibitors during labeling of dna which permits accurate assessment of lymphocyte blastogenesis. using these modified culture conditions, stimulated lymphocytes of localized (ljp) and generalized (gjp) forms of jp patients did not differ significantly from stimulated lymphocytes of healthy subjects in counts incorporated, stimulation index, incubation time, cell concentration or activator dose required for maximal blastogenesis to bacterial preparations of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (y-4), bacteroides gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochraceus, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sanguis and treponema denticola. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures reflecting the autologous mixed lymphocyte response (amlr) were increased for ljp compared to healthy subjects although not statistically significant. unstimulated lymphocyte cultures of gjp were decreased compared to healthy subjects and ljp (p less than 0.05). these observations indicate that gjp patients may have abnormalities in t- and b-lymphocyte regulatory mechanisms.

TI  == lymphoproliferative responses to oral bacteria in humans with varying severities  of periodontal disease.
AB  == we assessed in vitro the lymphocyte blastogenic resp onsess of peripheral blood lymphocytes to antigen extracts of a large battery of oral microorganisms in a population of humans with varying severities of periodontal disease. when the magnitudes and frequencies of statistically positive blastogenic responses to various oral microorganisms were compared, three general patterns emerged. the actinomyces species proved to be potent stimulators of lymphocyte blastogenesis in most subjects tested, whereas streptococcus sanguis, campylobacter, and eikenella corrodens stimulated few individuals. the response to these organisms correlated poorly with the severity of periodontal disease in the tested patients. however, several gram-negative anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides asaccharolyticus and treponema denticola, elicited statistically more frequent positive response in subjects with destructive periodontitis compared with patients with gingivitis. these results, taken together with recent microbiological findings, suggest that the specificity of the lymphocyte blastogenic response to antigens of oral bacteria correlates with the presence of these organisms in the subgingival microflora during various periodontal disease  states.
