TI  == increased infection with key periodontal pathogens during gestational diabetes mellitus.
AB  == aim: gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm), gingivitis, infection with specific periodontal pathogens and systemic inflammation each increase the risk for poor pregnancy outcome. we set out to monitor the interactions of gingivitis and gdm with respect to oral infection and the systemic inflammatory burden. materials and methods: four case-control groups (n = 117) were recruited, (1) no gingivitis, no gdm (n = 27); (2) gingivitis, no gdm (n = 31); (3) no gingivitis,  gdm (n = 21); and (4) gingivitis, gdm (n = 38). oral infection with three key periodontal pathogens was determined by pcr. systemic inflammation was determined by quantification of crp by eia. results: gingivitis during pregnancy was associated with oral infection with porphyromonas gingivalis, filifactor alocis and treponema denticola and combinations thereof (all p < 0.01). gdm was also associated with increased infection with individual and multiple oral pathogens (all p < 0.05). gingivitis during pregnancy led to a 325% increase in systemic crp (mean, 2495 versus 8116 ng/ml, p < 0.01). conclusions: diabetes and gingivitis act in concert to increase risk biomarkers for poor pregnancy outcome.

TI  == quantitative analysis of classical and new putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm: a case-control study.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of species/phylotypes have been newly implicated as putative periopathogens. the objective of this study was to explore associations among classical and new pathogens in subgingival biofilm and to assess their relative importance to chronic periodontitis. material and methods:  pooled subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis and 40 healthy controls. taqman q-pcr assays were used to determine the absolute and relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, oral synergistetes and oral tm7s. microbial associations were assessed using cluster analysis. different statistical models were used to explore associations between  microbial parameters and periodontitis. results: the median log and relative counts were lowest for tm7s (4.4 and 0.0016%, respectively) and highest for oral  synergistetes (7.2 and 1.4%, respectively). oral synergistetes clustered strongly with the red complex, particularly t. forsythia (100% rescaled similarity). all species/phylotypes except tm7s were significantly associated with periodontitis (mann-whitney test; p </= 0.005). however, p. gingivalis and f. alocis lost association after adjusting for confounders (ordinal regression). in receiving operator characteristic curve analysis, the log counts of oral synergistetes were the best markers of periodontitis (82.5% sensitivity and specificity), followed by those of t. forsythia, p. micra and t. denticola. in prediction analysis, however, p. micra was the only microbial predictor of periodontal parameters. conclusions: oral synergistetes are presented here as new members of the red complex, with relative importance to periodontitis exceeding that of the classical members. p. micra is shown as an important periodontal pathogen warranting more attention.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == antigenic activity of bacterial endodontic contents from primary root canal infection with periapical lesions against macrophage in the release of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha.
AB  == introduction: periradicular tissue chronic stimulation by endotoxin may cause apical periodontitis. this study investigated the microbial profile and the levels of endotoxin found in primary root canal infection with apical periodontitis, determined their antigenicity against macrophages through the levels of interleukin (il)-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and evaluated their relationship with clinical and radiographic findings. methods: samples were taken from 21 root canals with primary endodontic infection and apical periodontitis with paper points. pcr technique (16s rdna) was used for the detection of the target bacteria. limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) was used to measure endotoxin. the amounts of il-1ss/ tnf-alpha in macrophages supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--duoset-kit (elisa). results:  prevotella nigrescens (13/21), porphyromonas endodontalis (6/21), and treponema socranskii (6/21) were the most frequently detected gram-negative bacterial species. the presence of the sinus tract (2/21) was related to the detection of filifactor alocis (p < 0.05), whereas a tooth with a radiolucent area > or = 2 mm was related to the detection of treponema denticola. a correlation was found between the number of gram-negative bacteria and the levels of il-1beta/tnf-alpha (p < 0.05). increased levels of endotoxin were followed by tnf-alpha release (p < 0.05). higher levels of il-1beta (p < 0.05) and endotoxin contents were related to the larger size of the radiolucent area. conclusion: the antigenicity of the endodontic contents is not only related to the amount of endotoxin found in the root canal but also to the number of different species of gram-negative bacteria  involved in the infection. moreover, a larger size (> or = 2 mm) of the radiolucent area was related to il-1beta and endotoxin.

TI  == response of subgingival bacteria to smoking cessation.
AB  == it has been demonstrated that smoking cessation alters the subgingival microbial  profile; however, the response of individual bacteria within this ecosystem has not been well studied. the aim of this investigation, therefore, was to longitudinally examine the effect of smoking cessation on the prevalence and levels of selected subgingival bacteria using molecular approaches for bacterial  identification and enumeration. subgingival plaque was collected from 22 smokers  at the baseline and 12 months following periodontal nonsurgical management and smoking cessation counseling. the prevalence and abundance of selected organisms  were examined using nested pcr and multiplexed bead-based flow cytometry. eleven  subjects successfully quit smoking over 12 months (quitters), while 11 continued  to smoke throughout (smokers). smoking cessation led to a decrease in the prevalence of porphyromonas endodontalis and dialister pneumosintes at 12 months  and in the levels of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, and treponema denticola. smoking cessation also led to an increase in the levels of veillonella parvula. following nonsurgical periodontal therapy and smoking cessation, the subgingival microbiome is recolonized by a greater number of health-associated species and there are a significantly lower prevalence and abundance of putative  periodontal pathogens. the results indicate a critical role for smoking cessation counseling in periodontal therapy for smokers in order to effectively alter the subgingival microbiome.

TI  == bacteria in the apical root canal of teeth with primary apical periodontitis.
AB  == objective: bacteria settled in the apical root canal are in a privileged position to inflict damage to the periradicular tissues. therefore, the species identified in this region can be of special relevance for the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. this study investigated the occurrence and levels of several bacterial taxa in the apical root canal of teeth with apical periodontitis. study design: dna extracts from samples taken from the apical part of the root canal of extracted teeth evincing chronic apical periodontitis lesions served as templates for analysis of the presence and levels of 28 bacterial species/phylotypes using  a 16s ribosomal rna gene-based reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay.  results: bacterial dna was detected in 19 out of 20 samples. detected taxa included pseudoramibacter alactolyticus (32%), bacteroidetes clone x083 (26%), streptococcus species (21%), olsenella uli (10.5%), synergistes clone ba121 (10.5%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10.5%), porphyromonas endodontalis (10.5%), dialister clone bs016 (5%), filifactor alocis (5%), parvimonas micra (5%), and treponema denticola (5%). of these, only bacteroidetes clone x083 and synergistes clone ba121 were found at levels above 10(5). conclusion: occurrence of these bacterial taxa in the apical part of infected root canals indicates their potential pathogenetic role in the etiology of apical periodontitis.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial named species and uncultivated phylotypes in endodontic abscesses from two geographic locations.
AB  == evidence is mounting that the prevalence of some putative endodontic pathogens can significantly vary according to the geographic location in which samples were taken. this study aimed to provide additional knowledge on this subject by comparing the frequencies of 10 selected candidate endodontic pathogens in samples of acute apical abscesses obtained from two distinct geographic locations; portland, or, and rio de janeiro, brazil. dna was extracted from aspirates and used as template in nested pcr assays using 16s rrna gene taxon-specific oligonucleotide primers. of the target species/phylotypes, treponema denticola (73% of the cases), porphyromonas endodontalis (70%), and tannerella forsythia (57%) were the most prevalent taxa found in brazilian samples. dialister invisus (70% of the cases), p. endodontalis (63%) and dialister pneumosintes (55%) were the most frequent taxa in the portland, or samples. data analysis revealed that t. denticola and t. forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in the portland, or samples. although d. invisus, filifactor alocis, and synergistes oral clone w090  were detected in many more samples from the portland, or patients, differences were not found to be statistically significant. these findings confirmed that some bacterial taxa can markedly differ in the frequencies they occur in samples  from different locations. it remains to be clarified whether this observation translates into relevant therapeutic implications.

TI  == molecular analysis of filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola associated with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of strict anaerobes such as filifactor alocis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola in primary and secondary root-infected canals with periapical lesions by molecular analysis and  the association of these species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. microbial samples were taken from 100 root canals, 50 with necrotic pulp tissues  (npt, primary infection), and 50 with failed endodontic treatment (fet, secondary infection). dna was extracted from the samples, which were analyzed for the presence of three endodontic pathogens using species-specific primers and pcr. f. alocis were isolated from 23 canals with npt and 12 canals with fet; t. forsythia from 12 canals with npt and three canals with fet; t. denticola from 19 canals with npt and 12 canals with tep. suggested associations were found between primary infection and the presence of f. alocis and t. forsythia (both p < 0.05). in particular, associations were found between: pain and f. alocis; swelling and  f. alocis; tenderness to percussion and t. forsythia; mobility and t. forsythia and t. denticola; wet canals and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola; purulent exsudate and f. alocis, t. forsythia and t. denticola; abscess and f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola (all p < 0.05). the findings of this study indicated that f. alocis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola seem to be associated with endodontic signs and symptoms. additionally, f. alocis and t. forsythia were detected more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.
