escherichia coli virulence protein nleh1 interaction with the v-crk sarcoma virus ct10 oncogene-like protein (crkl) governs nleh1 inhibition of the ribosomal protein s3 (rps3)/nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) pathway.
enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and other attaching/effacing bacterial pathogens cause diarrhea in humans. these pathogens use a type iii secretion system to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, some of which inhibit the innate immune system. the enterohemorrhagic e. coli nleh1 effector prevents the nuclear translocation of rps3 (ribosomal protein s3) to inhibit its participation as a nuclear "specifier" of nf-kappab binding to target gene promoters. nleh1 binds to rps3 and inhibits its phosphorylation on ser-209 by ikappab kinase-beta (ikkbeta). however, the precise mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. nleh1 possesses a ser/thr protein kinase activity that is essential both for its ability to inhibit the rps3/nf-kappab pathway and for full virulence of the attaching/effacing mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium. however, neither rps3 nor ikkbeta is a substrate of nleh1 kinase activity. we therefore screened approximately 9,000 human proteins to identify nleh1 kinase substrates and identified crkl (v-crk sarcoma virus ct10 oncogene-like protein), a substrate of the bcr/abl kinase. knockdown of crkl abundance prevented nleh1 from inhibiting rps3 nuclear translocation and nf-kappab activity. crkl residues tyr-198 and tyr-207 were required for interaction with nleh1. lys-159, the kinase-active site of nleh1, was necessary for its interaction with crkl. we also identified crkl as an ikkbeta interaction partner, mediated by crkl tyr-198. we propose that the crkl interaction with ikkbeta recruits nleh1 to the ikkbeta complex, where nleh1 then inhibits the rps3/nf-kappab pathway.
the apolipoprotein e-mimetic peptide cog112 inhibits the inflammatory response to citrobacter rodentium in colonic epithelial cells by preventing nf-kappab activation.
inflammatory bowel disease arises from the interplay between luminal bacteria and the colonic mucosa. targeted inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways without global immunosuppression is highly desirable. apolipoprotein (apo) e has immunomodulatory effects and synthetically derived apoe-mimetic peptides are beneficial in models of sepsis and neuroinflammation. citrobacter rodentium is the rodent equivalent of enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and it causes colitis in mice by colonizing the surface of colonic epithelial cells and inducing signaling events. we have reported that mice deficient in inducible nitric-oxide (no) synthase (inos) have attenuated c. rodentium-induced colitis. we used young adult mouse colon (yamc) cells that mimic primary colonic epithelial cells to study effects of an antennapedia-linked apoe-mimetic peptide, cog112, on c. rodentium-activated cells. cog112 significantly attenuated induction of no production, and inos mrna and protein expression, in a concentration-dependent manner. cog112 inhibited the c. rodentium-stimulated induction of inos and the cxc chemokines kc and mip-2 to the same degree as the nf-kappab inhibitors mg132 or bay 11-7082, and there was no additive effect when cog112 and these inhibitors were combined. cog112 significantly reduced nuclear translocation of nf-kappab, when assessed by electromobility shift assay, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence for p65. this correlated with inhibition of both c. rodentium-stimulated ikappab-alpha phosphorylation and degradation, and ikappab kinase activity, which occurred by inhibition of ikappab kinase complex formation rather than by a direct effect on the enzyme itself. these studies indicate that apoe-mimetic peptides may have novel therapeutic potential by inhibiting nf-kappab-driven proinflammatory epithelial responses to pathogenic colonic bacteria.
the enteropathogenic e. coli effector espb facilitates microvillus effacing and antiphagocytosis by inhibiting myosin function.
enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) destroys intestinal microvilli and suppresses phagocytosis by injecting effectors into infected cells through a type iii secretion system (ttss). espb, a component of the ttss, is also injected into the cytoplasm of host cells. however, the physiological functions of espb within the host cell cytoplasm remain unclear. we show that espb binds to myosins, which are a superfamily of proteins that interact with actin filaments and mediate essential cellular processes, including microvillus formation and phagocytosis. espb inhibits the interaction of myosins with actin, and an espb mutant that lacks the myosin-binding region maintained its ttss function but could not induce microvillus effacing or suppress phagocytosis. moreover, the myosin-binding region of espb is essential for citrobacter rodentium, an epec-related murine pathogen, to efficiently infect mice. these results suggest that espb inhibits myosin functions and thereby facilitates efficient infection by epec.
