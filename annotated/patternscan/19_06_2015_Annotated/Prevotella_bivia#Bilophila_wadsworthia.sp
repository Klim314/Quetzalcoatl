TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  == using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/ml against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against gram-positive organisms. all haemophilus and moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/ml of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all prevotella species [all except one strain of p. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/ml] and occasional strains of bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides fragilis, bilophila  wadsworthia, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, propionibacterium acnes, and veillonella species. all fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/ml of gemifloxacin. based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
