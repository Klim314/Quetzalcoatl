antimicrobial function of the gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide in the skin of  skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 3.4 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified skin extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with that of other known polypeptides revealed high sequence homology with the yfgap (yellowfin tuna glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-related antimicrobial peptide); thus, this peptide was identified as the skipjack tuna gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide (sjgap). sjgap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 1.2-17.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli d31, and vibrio parahaemolyticus (mecs, 3.1-12.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec, 16.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide is heat-stable but salt-sensitive. according to the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling, this peptide consists of three secondary structural motifs, including one alpha-helix and two parallel beta-strands, and forms an amphipathic structure. this peptide showed neither membrane permeabilization ability nor killing ability, but did display a small degree of leakage ability. these results suggest that sjgap acts through a bacteriostatic process rather than bactericidal one. sjgap is another gapdh-related antimicrobial peptide isolated from skipjack tuna and likely plays an important role for gapdh in the innate immune defense of tuna fish.

in vitro microbiological evaluation of 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones, novel bisacetylated pyrazoles.
novel 1,1'-(5,5'-(1,4-phenylene)bis(3-aryl-1h-pyrazole-5,1-(4h,5h)-diyl))diethanones 7-12 were tested for their antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion and twofold serial dilution method against the tested bacterial and fungal strains. compounds 7 against micrococcus luteus, 8 against beta-heamolytic streptococcus, m. luteus, klebsiella pneumonia, microsporum gypseum, 9 against staphylococcus aureus, shigella flexneri, vibreo cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus flavus, mucor indicus, 10 against salmonella typhii, s. flexneri, m. gypseum, 11 against k. pneumonia, m. gypseum, 12 against k. pneumonia, and m. gypseum show superior zone of inhibitions and exhibited excellent antibacterial and antifungal activities at a mic value of 6.25 mug/ml. moreover, all the tested compounds 7-12 revealed promising antitubercular activity against mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv and inh-resistant m. tuberculosis. compounds 8 against m. tuberculosis and 11 against inh-resistant m. tuberculosis exhibited the percentage of reduction in rlu at 89 and 85%, respectively.
in vitro interaction of chronic wound bacteria in biofilms.
objective: to use in vitro biofilm models of wound bacterial isolates and compare the biofilms produced for different combinations of wound bacterial species. method: in vitro biofilms, generated by pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus oralis and micrococcus luteus in microtitre plates and a constant depth film fermentor (cdff), were studied. the tested isolates all originated from chronic venous leg ulcers. biofilms of individual and dual combinations of these species were generated in microtitre plate wells at 37 degrees c for 24-96 hours and also in the cdff for 7 days. the extent of biofilm formation from these systems was then measured using crystal violet staining and/or total viable counts. results: all the chronic wound bacteria formed biofilms (both individually and in mixed culture) in these models. in mixed species microtitre plate biofilms, both p. aeruginosa and s. aureus appeared to antagonise biofilm formation by s. oralis and m. luteus, with p. aeruginosa completely inhibiting the growth of these organisms. similar effects were evident in the cdff model, when all four bacterial species were added simultaneously, with m. luteus being 'out-competed' by the other organisms present and occurring at numbers at the limits of detection; however, there was an apparent increase in the numbers of s. oralis compared with its single culture equivalent. conclusion: the study highlighted differences in biofilm formation ability for the tested species in both closed and open model systems. using dual species biofilms, distinct species antagonism was observed with apparent antagonism of pathogenic species over 'commensal' ones. such a finding provides insight into possible bacterial interactions during development of 'non-healing' wound biofilms.

bass hepcidin is a novel antimicrobial peptide induced by bacterial challenge.
we report the isolation of a novel antimicrobial peptide, bass hepcidin, from the gill of hybrid striped bass, white bass (morone chrysops) x striped bass (m. saxatilis). after the intraperitoneal injection of micrococcus luteus and escherichia coli, the peptide was purified from hplc fractions with antimicrobial activity against escherichia coli. sequencing by edman degradation revealed a 21-residue peptide (gcrfccnccpnmsgcgvccrf) with eight putative cysteines. molecular mass measurements of the native peptide and the reduced and alkylated peptide confirmed the sequence with four intramolecular disulfide bridges. peptide sequence homology to human hepcidin and other predicted hepcidins, indicated that the peptide is a new member of the hepcidin family. nucleotide sequences for cdna and genomic dna were determined for white bass. a predicted prepropeptide (85 amino acids) consists of three domains: a signal peptide (24 amino acids), prodomain (40 amino acids) and a mature peptide (21 amino acids). the gene has two introns and three exons. a tata box and several consensus-binding motifs for transcription factors including c/ebp, nuclear factor-kappab, and hepatocyte nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the transcriptional start site. in white bass liver, hepcidin gene expression was induced 4500-fold following challenge with the fish pathogen, streptococcus iniae, while expression levels remained low in all other tissues tested. a novel antimicrobial peptide from the gill, bass hepcidin, is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly inducible by bacterial exposure.
in vitro determination of direct antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
the objective of this study was to determine in vitro the time required for calcium hydroxide in direct contact with microorganisms to express its antimicrobial effect. the microorganisms used were: micrococcus luteus (atcc-9341), staphylococcus aureus (atcc-6538), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc-25586), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc-27853), escherichia coli, and streptococcus sp. the strains were cultivated in brain heart infusion (bhi), with the exception of f. nucleatum (bhi-pras). pure and mixed suspensions of the microorganisms were prepared. paper cones immersed in these substances were covered with calcium hydroxide paste, and after 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7 days they were transferred to an appropriate medium to observe the growth and multiplication of the microorganisms. incubation was conducted at 37 degrees c for 48 h, according to the requirements of oxygen of each microorganism. the antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide was shown to occur after 12 h on m. luteus and f. nucleatum, 24 h on streptococcus sp, 48 h on e. coli, and 72 h on s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. mixture ii (m. luteus + streptococcus sp + s. aureus) was sensitive to calcium hydroxide antimicrobial potential after 48 h, whereas mixture i (m. luteus + e. coli + p. aeruginosa), mixture iii (e. coli + p. aeruginosa), and mixture iv (s. aureus + p. aeruginosa) were inactivated after 72 h of exposure.
antimicrobial activity of sphingosines.
the antimicrobial activity of stratum corneum lipids was examined by screening in vitro various representative phospholipids and sphingolipids. of mixed galacto-cerebrosides; phosphatidic acid; phosphatidic acid-monomethylester-dioleoyl; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylethanolamine-beta-oleoyl-gamma-palmitoyl; phosphatidylcholine; d-sphingosine; d,l-sphinganine; 4-d-hydroxysphinganine; oleoyl-sphingosine; n,n-dimethylsphingosine; and stearylamine, only the sphingosines and, to a lesser extent, stearylamine were clearly and profoundly effective against staphylococcus aureus (4-log reduction at 6.25 micrograms/ml [20 microm]; 2-log reduction at 0.78 mu/ml [2.5 microm]). the sphingosines were similarly active against streptococcus pyogenes, micrococcus luteus, propionibacterium acnes, brevibacterium epidermidis, and candida albicans, moderately active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, and ineffective against escherichia coli and serratia marcescens. both erythro- and threo-isomers were effective. optimal inhibition was at 60 min incubation at 37 degrees c and at ph 6.5. antimicrobial activity, which was ca++ dependent, was confirmed in vivo by topical application and microbial challenge. because free sphingosines are available in the stratum corneum and other epidermal layers, these lipids may contribute to the cutaneous antimicrobial barrier.
[antibacterial activity of cervical mucus in pregnant or non-pregnant women].
antibacterial activities of human cervical mucus obtained from non-pregnant and pregnant women were tested using standard blood agar plates. the combined effect of cervical mucus with cefmetazole (cmz) was also investigated. obtained results are summarized as follows. 1. cervical mucus specimens obtained from 6 subjects at 9 to 36 weeks of pregnancy showed antibacterial activity to only one strain of bacillus subtilis among organisms tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activity of cmz against 1 strain of streptococcus pyogenes and 2 strains of micrococcus luteus, but no effect was observed against other organisms tested. 2. cervical mucus specimens obtained from non-pregnant women showed antibacterial activities to 8 of 11 strains (72.7%) of b. subtilis tested. the cervical mucus enhanced the activities of cmz against 1 strain of s. pyogenes and 3 strains of b. subtilis. the tested organisms included staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, m. luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, and candida albicans, but, as described above, cervical mucus samples showed antimicrobial activities only against b. subtilis (9/17, 52.9%), and specimens obtained only from non-pregnant women or pregnant women with less than 11 weeks of pregnancy showed any antimicrobial activities.
[antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
this study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. the samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. the test microorganisms included escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, vibrio parahaemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus aureus, mycobacterium phlei, streptococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, and micrococcus luteus. raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. the antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. however, green onion could inhibit p. aeruginosa and m. luteus, but onion could inhibit e. coli, p. vulgaris, s. faecalis, and b. cereus. ginger and ginger root could only inhibit m. luteus. chili pepper could inhibit v. parahaemolyticus and p. vulgaris. brown pepper could also inhibit p. vulgaris. sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. in general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. all the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees c.
[reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.
effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02 to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
competitive inhibition of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) from phages t4 and t6 competes poorly with homologous dna causing only a slight decrease of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis. other types of heterologous dnas (micrococcus luteus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage t6 dna), in contrast to glucosylated t4 and t6 dnas, compete with transforming dna to the normal, high extent. these results indicate that as in transformation of bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage t6 dna considerably decreases the interaction of such dna with competent cells of the challis strain. it also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of dna is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
