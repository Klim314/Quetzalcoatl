TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == characterization of an endophytic bacterial community associated with eucalyptus  spp.
AB  == endophytic bacteria were isolated from stems of eucalyptus spp (eucalyptus citriodora, e. grandis, e. urophylla, e. camaldulensis, e. torelliana, e. pellita, and a hybrid of e. grandis and e. urophylla) cultivated at two sites; they were characterized by rapd and amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra).  endophytic bacteria were more frequently isolated from e. grandis and e. pellita. the 76 isolates were identified by 16s rdna sequencing as erwinia/pantoea (45%),  agrobacterium sp (21%), curtobacterium sp (9%), brevibacillus sp (8%), pseudomonas sp (8%), acinetobacter sp (4%), burkholderia cepacia (2.6%), and lactococcus lactis (2.6%). genetic characterization of these endophytic bacteria  isolates showed at least eight ardra haplotypes. the genetic diversity of 32 erwinia/pantoea and 16 agrobacterium sp isolates was assessed with the rapd technique. there was a high level of genetic polymorphism among all the isolates  and there was positive correlation between the clusters and the geographic origin of the strains. these endophytic bacteria were further analyzed for in vitro interaction with endophytic fungi from eucalyptus spp. we found that metabolites  secreted by erwinia/pantoea and b. cepacia isolates had an inhibitory growth effect on some endophytic fungi, suggesting that these metabolites play a role in bacterial-fungal interactions inside the host plant. apparently, these bacteria could have an important role in plant development; in the future they may be useful for biological control of diseases and plant growth promotion, as well as  for the production of new metabolites and enzymes.

TI  == stability of microbial communities in goat milk during a lactation year: molecular approaches.
AB  == the microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of  lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of  breeding conditions on their composition. the diversity of microbial communities  was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16s and 18s rdna sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16s rdna from clone libraries (six milks). the stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by single strand conformation polymorphism (sscp) analysis of variable region v3 of the 16s rrna gene and variable region v4 of the 18s rrna gene. one hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed. in addition to species commonly encountered  in milk, such as lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus caprae, staphylococcus equorum, micrococcus sp., kocuria sp., pantoea agglomerans and pseudomonas putida, sequences were affiliated to other species only described in cheeses, such as corynebacterium variabile, arthrobacter sp., brachybacterium paraconglomeratum, clostridium sp. and rothia sp. several halophilic species atypical in milk were found, belonging to jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, salinicoccus sp., dietza maris, exiguobacterium, ornithinicoccus sp. and hahella chejuensis. the yeast community  was composed of debaryomyces hansenii, kluyveromyces lactis, trichosporon beigelii, rhodotorula glutinis, rhodotorula minuta, candida pararugosa, candida intermedia, candida inconspicua, cryptococcus curvatus and cryptococcus magnus. the analyses of microbial counts and microbial sscp profiles both distinguished four groups of milks corresponding to four periods defined by season and feeding  regime. the microbial community was stable within each period. milks from winter  were characterized by lactococcus and pseudomonas, those from summer by p. agglomerans and klebsiella and those from autumn by chryseobacterium indologenes, acinetobacter baumanii, staphylococcus, corynebacteria and yeasts. however, the composition of the community can vary according to factors other than feeding. this study opens new investigation fields in the field of raw milk microbial ecology.
