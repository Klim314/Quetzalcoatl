TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == epstein-barr virus associated peri-implantitis: a split-mouth study.
AB  == objectives: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a potential role in periodontitis and peri-implantitis (pi) etiopathogenesis. pi lesions can worsen depending on specific microbial challenge and host susceptibility. this cross-sectional split-mouth study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial co-infection in pi patients and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination. methods: pcr-based identification was performed on 23 patients presenting pi and contralateral healthy implants, and compared to unstimulated whole saliva. clinical evaluation included probing depths, bleeding  on probing, and suppuration. radiographs were assessed for the presence of lamina dura and bone loss. three sample sites per patient were tested: pi lesions, healthy implant sulci, and saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus  (ebv) and cytomegalovirus (cmv) copy counts. significance of group comparisons for binary-dependent variables, within-subjects designs, was determined by mcnemar's chi-square test. risk analysis was evaluated through odds ratios (or).  results: pi lesions were 14.2 (p = 0.001; 95 % confidence interval [ci], 1.6-124.1) and 3 times (p = 0.03; 95 % ci, 0.7-11.9) more likely to harbor ebv than healthy implants and saliva, respectively. ebv positive predictive value was 90 %. pi was associated with absence of lamina dura and higher periodontopathogen proportions. saliva sampling showed high agreement with pi bacterial detection (89-100 % rate) but not with ebv (44.4 %). the or of pi lesions harboring treponema denticola or tannerella forsythia was 6.79 (p = 0.007; 95 % ci, 1.8-25.0) and 3.3 (p < 0.0001; 95 % ci, 0.3-34.3) times higher than healthy implants, respectively. saliva of patients with pi was 5.6 times more likely to be contaminated with prevotella nigrescens than healthy peri-implant sulci (p = 0.002). pi lesions were 1.92 times more likely to harbor prevotella nigrescens than healthy implants (p = 0.04). conclusions: ebv is a potential candidate in peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. saliva pcr analysis is useful in predicting peri-implantitis-specific bacterial infection but not ebv or cmv. clinical significance: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may favor ongoing microbial challenge in peri-implant disease and exacerbate its progression. ebv infection may explain non-responsive to treatment pi. peri-implantitis individuals may benefit from antiviral therapy.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on epithelial cell migration in vitro.
AB  == oral ulcerations often arise as a side effect from chemo- and radiation therapy.  in a previous clinical study, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified as a positive predictor for oral ulcerations after hematopoetic stem cell transplantation, possibly incriminating p. gingivalis in delayed healing of the ulcerations. therefore, it was tested whether p. gingivalis and its secreted products could inhibit the migration of oral epithelial cells in an in vitro scratch assay. to compare, the oral bacteria prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and streptococcus mitis were included. a standardized scratch was made in a confluent layer of human oral epithelial cells. the epithelial cells were challenged with bacterial cells and with medium  containing secretions of these bacteria. closure of the scratch was measured after 17 h using a phase contrast microscope. p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and secretions of p. gingivalis strongly inhibited cell migration. a challenge with 1000 heat-killed bacteria versus 1 epithelial cell resulted in a relative closure of the scratch of 25% for p. gingivalis and 20% for p. nigrescens. weaker inhibitory effects were found for the other bacteria. the results confirmed our hypothesis that the oral bacteria may be involved in delayed wound healing.

TI  == suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: suppuration (sup) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. the aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with sup in patients with chronic (cp) and aggressive (agp) periodontitis. methods: a total of 156 patients with cp and 66 with agp were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). the counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the mann-whitney and wilcoxon tests, respectively. associations between frequency of sup and bacterial species were analyzed by the spearman correlation coefficient. results: the prevalence of sup in patients with cp was 24.4%, and in patients with agp it was 30.3%, and the percentage of sup sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (p >0.05). sup sites from patients with cp had significantly higher counts of veillonella parvula, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella nigrescens than sup  sites from patients with agp (p <0.005). significant positive correlations between high frequency of sup and high levels of actinomyces spp, streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with cp (p <0.05). in patients with agp, actinomyces oris, propionibacterium acnes, p. aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  and streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with sup, whereas prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with sup (p <0.05). conclusions: sup sites from patients with cp harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than sup sites from patients with agp. actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, t. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with sup.

TI  == quantification of cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in post-treatment apical periodontitis before and after chemo-mechanical preparation.
AB  == this clinical study was conducted to quantify cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in root canals with post-treatment apical periodontitis by correlating their levels with clinical features and to evaluate the effect of chemo-mechanical preparation (cmp) with 2 % chlorhexidine gel + 17 % edta on bacterial and endotoxin removal/elimination. moreover, target strict gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). fifteen teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis were sampled before (s1) and after (s2) cmp.  culture techniques determined the number of colony-forming units (cfu). pcr (16s  rdna) and limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. prevotella nigrescens (4/15), prevotella intermedia (2/15), and tannerella forsythia (2/15) were the most frequently detected species. endotoxin was recovered in 100 % of the samples. at s1, bacteria and endotoxin were detected at a median value of 5.14 x 10(3) cfu/ml and 3.96 eu/ml, respectively. higher levels of endotoxin were related to a larger size of radiolucent area (>5 mm) (p < 0.05). cmp was more effective in reducing bacteria (99.61 %) than endotoxin (60.6 %) (both p < 0.05). our findings indicated that the levels of endotoxin found in infected root canals were related to a larger size of radiolucent area in the periapical region. moreover, cmp was  effective in reducing both bacterial and endotoxin contents in post-treatment apical periodontitis.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == molecular detection of human periodontal pathogens in oral swab specimens from dogs in japan.
AB  == periodontal diseases are known to be major diseases in humans, and are also common in dogs. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution  of periodontitis-related bacterial species using oral swab specimens collected from 26 pet dogs. the distribution of an animal gingival organism porphyromonas gulae, in addition to 10 human periodontitis-related bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with species-specific sets of primers. porphyromonas gulae, tannerella forsythia and campylobacter rectus were detected in almost all dogs analyzed, all of which should be regarded as common members of oral flora in dogs. then, isolation and identification of the porphyromonas species in swab specimens were performed. there were 35 strains isolated from 22 dogs, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction and sequencing methods revealed that approximately 70% of them were porphyromonas gulae. in contrast, the frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis was extremely low. these findings indicate the presence of specific periodontitis-related pathogens in pet dogs, especially porphyromonas gulae.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque before and during the early period of orthodontic treatment.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == identification of periodontal pathogens and severity of periodontitis in patients with and without chronic kidney disease.
AB  == objective: in this study of patients with chronic periodontitis (cp), the severity of the disease and the main periodontal pathogens identified in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) were compared with those detected in individuals without systemic disease. design: nineteen patients with cp without evidence of systemic disease (control group), 25 patients with cp and ckd who were in the pre-dialysis stages (pre-dialysis group), and 22 patients with cp and ckd who were on renal replacement therapy (rrt group) were examined. the severity of cp was based on the investigation of probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal). the definition and stage of ckd were based on the criteria proposed by the kidney disease outcomes quality initiative of the national kidney foundation. glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using  the equation of modification of diet in renal disease and the identification of microorganisms in subgingival plaque was performed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: candida albicans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were more common in patients who were on rrt and pre-dialysis than in control subjects. cp was more severe in patients with ckd. a strong association was observed between the frequency of c. albicans (p =  0.056), p.gingivalis (p = 0.008), t. denticola (p = 0.013) and cal, when ckd patients were compared with the control group. conclusion: cp is more severe and  is associated with increased frequency of c. albicans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola in patients with ckd.

TI  == the effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by mda and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization after uniform amplification of dna in samples  by multiple displacement amplification (mda). methodology: forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples;  these were mda-amplified and analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. results: the mean amount of dna in the samples prior  to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after mda. the mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest  whole number. the most prevalent taxa were prevotella intermedia (96.9%), neisseria mucosa (65.6%), prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and tannerella forsythia  (56.2%). aggregatibacter (haemophilus) aphrophilus and helicobacter pylori were not detected. p. intermedia (10%), prevotella tannerae (7%) and prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. conclusion: root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. prevotella sp. were commonly  found with p. intermedia, prevotella tannerae and prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == [detection of periodental pathogens in atherosclerotic lesions in patients].
AB  == objective: to detect periodontopathic bacterial dna in atherosclerotic vascular lesions in a group of chinese patients by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) techniques. methods: ten human specimens of atherosclerotic plaque were obtained  sterilely. the sclerotic lesions were blade into fine pieces and dna was isolated from the samples. to detect porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythia(tf), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans(aa), prevotella intermedia(pi), prevotella nigrescens(pn), treponema denticola(td), campylobacter rectus(cr), pcr amplification of bacterial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) was carried out. results: pcr assays for bacterial 16s rdna indicated the presence of periodontal pathogens in 3 out of 10 surgical specimens. dna of pg were found in  3 samples, tf was found only in one among the 3 samples and pn was found in another sample among the 3 samples. conclusion: the data confirm that dna of periodontal pathogens present in atherosclerotic plaques. pg, tf, pn may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis in these chinese patients. further studies with large size samples are needed.

TI  == changes in the incidence of periodontal pathogens during long-term monitoring and after application of antibacterial drugs.
AB  == the incidence of potential periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients with chronic periodontitis and in healthy control subjects. two types of studies were carried out in which the composition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. fluctuation or at least pronounced quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented in the long-term study as well as after the local administration of antibacterial drug chlo-site or metronidazole. even within two weeks, a turnover  of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. a relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically healthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" niches in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. this should be kept in mind when a local application of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy of periodontal disease.

TI  == microbiologic changes in subgingival plaque after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances.
AB  == objective: to evaluate changes that occur in the subgingival microbiota after removal of fixed orthodontic appliances using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (11 males and 19 females; aged 20 +/- 7.3 yr) were included in this study. subgingival plaque samplings were gathered from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors and the left lower central incisors, and from the mesio-buccal gingival  crevice of the left upper first molars and the left lower first molars, at two different times: 2 weeks before appliance removal (t1), and 3 months after appliance removal (t2). dna was extracted from the samples and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans , tannerella forsythia , campylobacter rectus , eikenella corrodens , porphyromonas gingivalis , prevotella intermedia , prevotella nigrescens , and treponema denticola , which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of positive sites at t1 and t2 was 65% and 43.3% for c. rectus , and 53.3% and 30.8% for e. corrodens , respectively. for the other bacteria, the frequency tended to be reduced between  times. conclusion: periodontopathogens during orthodontic treatment were significantly reduced within 3 months of appliance removal. however, how long it  takes to return to the preorthodontic composition of the subgingival microbiota and whether it happens at all remain to be seen.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria and periodontal health status in  dental students.
AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

TI  == similarities in the subgingival microbiota assessed by a curet sampling method at sites with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: the goal of this study was to determine whether site-specific differences in the subgingival microbiota could be detected by the checkerboard method in subjects with periodontitis. methods: subjects with at least six periodontal pockets with a probing depth (pd) between 5 and 7 mm were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples were collected with sterile curets by a single-stroke procedure at six selected periodontal sites from 161 subjects (966  subgingival sites). subgingival bacterial samples were assayed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method identifying 37 species. results: probing depths of 5, 6, and 7 mm were found at 50% (n = 483), 34% (n = 328), and  16% (n = 155) of sites, respectively. statistical analysis failed to demonstrate  differences in the sum of bacterial counts by tooth type (p = 0.18) or specific location of the sample (p = 0.78). with the exceptions of campylobacter gracilis  (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001), analysis by general linear model multivariate regression failed to identify subject or sample location factors as explanatory to microbiologic results. a trend of difference in bacterial load by tooth type was found for prevotella nigrescens (p <0.01). at a  cutoff level of > or = 1.0 x 10(5), porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) were present at 48.0% to 56.3% and 46.0% to 51.2% of sampled sites, respectively. conclusions: given the similarities in the clinical evidence of periodontitis, the presence and levels of 37 species commonly studied in periodontitis are similar, with no differences between molar, premolar, and incisor/cuspid subgingival sites. this may facilitate microbiologic sampling strategies in subjects during periodontal therapy.

TI  == periodontal and microbiologic evaluation of 2 methods of archwire ligation: ligature wires and elastomeric rings.
AB  == introduction: prophylactic programs to prevent dental biofilm accumulation must be implemented to minimize the risk for periodontal diseases in orthodontic patients. therefore, we assessed the possible periodontal and microbiologic changes resulting from the use of 2 methods of orthodontic archwire ligation: elastomeric rings and steel ligatures. methods: the following parameters were measured: plaque index, gingival bleeding index, probing depth, and biofilm samples from the maxillary second premolars and the mandibular lateral incisors were evaluated in 14 subjects without clinical signs of gingival inflammation before orthodontic appliance placement and after 6 months of treatment. each orthodontic arch was fixed with elastomeric rings on 1 side of the midline, and steel ligatures were used on the opposite side. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and p nigrescens. results: the elastomeric rings were associated with a higher score for plaque index and bleeding than steel ligatures, as well as many positive sites of t forsythia and p nigrescens (p <0.05). conclusions: elastomeric rings favored these 2 periodontopathogens and harmed gingival conditions.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == [subgingival microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis in bogota, colombia: an epidemiological approach].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis-associated microbiotas differ in regions around the world and vary with a variety of factors. this suggests that each country must establish its own dental microbiobiotic profile in order to formulate adequate prevention measures and more specific treatments. objective: the prevalence and proportions of the following microorganisms were investigated: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, micromonas micros, fusobacterium spp, dialister pneumosintes and enteric  rods. the patients selected had been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis from clinical populations in bogota, colombia. the variables of age, gender and socioeconomic level were included in the comparisons. materials and methods: 183 patients were classified in two groups, chronic periodontitis (n=84) and aggressive periodontitis (n=59); 40 healthy subjects were selected for comparison. a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained from the 6 deepest periodontal pockets in every patient and processed by culture for the isolation and identification of bacteria. results: in chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp and e. corrodens showed high and similar prevalence, whereas m. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, d. pneumosintes and enteric rods (commonly from the tribe klebsielleae) showed less  and similar prevalence. in the healthy group, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus and fusobacterium spp showed high frequency whereas m. micros and e. corrodens showed moderate frequency. conclusions: porphyromonas gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, fusobacterium spp. and e. corrodens are important constituents of the microbiologic profile of the periodontitis in colombian populations. porphyromonas gingivalis was found more frequently than a. actinomycetemcomitans in aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == persistently high levels of periodontal pathogens associated with preterm pregnancy outcome.
AB  == background: few studies examining the association between periodontal diseases and preterm birth have explored the underlying microbial and antibody responses associated with oral infection. methods: a nested case-control study was performed using data from a recent interventional trial following the delayed-treatment control group of 31 subjects with periodontal diseases. the levels of eight oral bacteria and the maternal immunoglobulin g (igg) responses in serum to these bacteria were measured at antepartum and postpartum visits to determine the relationship to cases (preterm delivery <37 weeks' gestation) and controls (term delivery). results: antepartum, the levels of periodontal pathogens tended to be higher in the preterm (case group) deliveries compared to  the term deliveries (control group). maternal anti-porphyromonas gingivalis igg was significantly lower in the preterm group compared to the term group (p = 0.028). postpartum, levels of p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were statistically significantly higher in  preterm births compared to term deliveries, adjusting for baseline levels. the joint effects of red and orange microbial clusters were significantly higher in the preterm group compared to the term group. conclusions: high levels of periodontal pathogens and low maternal igg antibody response to periodontal bacteria during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery. further studies elucidating the role of the microbial load and maternal immune response as related to pregnancy outcome seem merited.

AB  == objectives: the aim of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the periodontal status and oral microbiological patterns of a population with end-stage renal disease (esrd), undergoing haemodialysis (hd). design: this was a cross-sectional study, involving 52 patients from the nephrology department and 52 matched control subjects. materials and methods: the subjects had a periodontal clinical  examination; subgingival plaque samples were taken and analysed using a semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test to detect porphyromas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were studied for candida and enterobacteriaceae. main outcome measures: most of the 104 subjects had some degree of loss of periodontal attachment (lpa) > or =3  mm [11 (10.5%) had severe lpa; 16 (15.4%) moderate lpa; and 64 (61.5%) mild lpa]. only 13 subjects (12.5%) presented good periodontal health. results: no statistically significant differences were found between the hd patients and the  control group regarding bleeding index, number of teeth, or percentage of lpa > or =3 mm. however, a statistically significant difference was seen in the degree  of oral hygiene. conclusions: on the basis of the findings presented here, we cannot associate esrd with more severe periodontal destruction. although hd patients presented a higher number of periodontopathic microorganisms than the matched controls, a prolonged duration of hd did not bear a statistically significant relationship with the percentage of sites with lpa > or =3 mm, specific microbiota or composition of biofilm.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of periodontally untreated mexican subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and aim: specific microbial profiles that may distinguish between generalized aggressive-periodontitis (gagp) and generalized chronic-periodontitis (gcp) have, to date, not been described. the purpose of the present study was to  describe the subgingival microbial composition of mexican subjects with gagp and  compare it with that of individuals with gcp and periodontal health (ph). material and methods: seventy-seven subjects with gagp (n=19), gcp (n=39) and ph  (n=19) were selected. clinical measurements included plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. up to 28 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each subject and analysed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: gagp and gcp subjects harboured significantly higher levels and/or proportion of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (levels: p<0.001, proportion: p<0.01), prevotella nigrescens (p<0.05 levels) and "red" complex species (p<0.001 proportion) than ph subjects. all gagp subjects were carriers of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens. no significant differences in any of the 40 microbial species  tested were detected between gagp and gcp subjects. conclusions: our results revealed that the microbial differences between gagp and gcp subjects were only discrete and none of the bacterial species tested seemed to specifically differentiate the subgingival microbial profile of either periodontitis group.

TI  == changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal parameters before and 3 months after bracket placement.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for  periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no  changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were  also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque  and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to  oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.

TI  == levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 with simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cholesterol in blood.
AB  == background and objectives: to investigate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase  (mmp) -8 and -9 with the simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) as well as mmp-9 and cholesterol in blood. although bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the periodontal disease process, in some individuals the reaction to bacteria may lead to an excessive host response, resulting in a general inflammatory response. methods: mmp-9 and lipids were analyzed from the blood samples of 33 subjects with a 16-year history and oral health records of periodontal disease as well as from 31 periodontally healthy controls. information was obtained on education, body mass index, and family history of atherosclerosis. gcf was taken to determine mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels, and bacterial samples were simultaneously collected for polymerase chain  reaction assessment of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. analysis of variance, chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. results: demographic data showed significant differences between patients and controls in  smoking (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.05), family history of atherosclerotic disease (p < 0.01), and education (p < 0.01). significant differences were also observed in oral health data, in the detection of p. gingivalis (p < 0.001), p. intermedia (p < 0.01), p. nigrescens (p < 0.001), and t. forsythia (p < 0.001) and in the levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gcf between patients and controls. t. forsythia[odds ratio(or) 10.1; p = 0.001] and age (or 5.54; p = 0.008) appeared to be the main independent predictors for high mmp-8 in gcf. patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05), and triglycerides (p < = 0.01) than controls. plasma levels of mmp-9 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.001). conclusions: specific periodontal microorganisms appeared to induce host  response, with increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival pockets as well as of mmp-9 in plasma, possibly triggering its up-regulation in blood.

TI  == supportive periodontal therapy using mechanical instrumentation or 2% minocycline gel: a 12 month randomized, controlled, single masked pilot study.
AB  == objective: to compare the short-term performance of subgingival local delivery of 2% minocycline gel and conventional subgingival debridement in supportive periodontal therapy (spt) patients. methods: forty adult patients having completed active treatment for moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis were included in a randomized, controlled, single masked maintenance care pilot study. sites with residual pocket probing depths > or =5 mm and bleeding on probing were treated with either minocycline gel (minocycline-group) or scaling and root planing only (debridement-group) at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.  results: full-mouth plaque and bleeding scores remained <10% and <20%, respectively, for both groups throughout the study. in both groups there was a persistent reduction in number of teeth and sites with probing pocket depths > or =5 mm (p<0.05) with no significant differences between the groups. the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, remained at levels < or =10(5) in the majority of patients and sites  in both groups. conclusion: this pilot study failed to show a difference between  local delivery of 2% minocycline gel as mono-therapy and traditional subgingival  debridement in patients on spt.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == prevalence of putative periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques from gingivitis lesions in korean orthodontic patients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any  orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions  of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the  samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from  the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

TI  == severe periodontitis in a 5-year-old girl with hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome.
AB  == the hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome (hies) is a multisystem disorder that affects  the: (1) dentition; (2) skeleton; (3) connective tissues; and (4) immune system.  little is known about periodontal manifestations of the syndrome. the purpose of  this report was to describe a 5-year-old girl with suspected autosomal-recessive  hies syndrome who revealed profusely bleeding and painful gingiva and generalized aggressive periodontitis. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based microbiological examination detected porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus in the deep periodontitis lesions. the extraction of all deciduous teeth due to a poor prognosis and risk of systemic infection led to resolution of the oral inflammation. long-term follow-up is required to determine the periodontal prognosis of the erupting permanent teeth.

TI  == herpesviruses, the missing link between gingivitis and periodontitis?
AB  == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is  presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == microbiological profile of early onset/aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial profile and to seek possible bacterial associations in the subgingival microbiota of early onset periodontitis/aggressive periodontitis patients by using two different techniques, culture and immunofluorescence. material and methods: the study group consisted of 66 systemically healthy individuals with evidence of early onset periodontitis - 41 females and 25 males aged 23-35 years (mean 31.1 +/- 3.1 years). bacterial samples were collected from the deepest site in each quadrant, resulting in a total of 264 sites with a mean probing pocket depth of 6.6 +/- 1.5 mm. samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and nonselective media, and isolates were characterized to species level. indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies was applied to detect actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus, tannerella forsythensis), prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros and actinomyces israelii. results: 93.6% of sampled sites showed bleeding on probing and 23.5% were positive for suppuration. p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, p.  gingivalis, and c. rectus were detected in 77.3-85.9% of samples using culture methods and in 85.6-91.3% using immunofluorescence. p. micros and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found, respectively, in 63.3% and 25.0% of all sites using culturing and in 58.7% and 27.7% sites using immunofluorescence. significantly strong positive associations were observed between t. forsythia and c. rectus (odds ratio 109.46), and t. forsythia and p. gingivalis (odd ratio 90.26), whereas a negative association was seen between p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio 0.42). coinfection by p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and c. rectus was observed  in 62.1% of the test sites, and in 89.4% of the studied subjects. the sensitivity of immunofluorescence for t. forsythia, c. rectus, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens and p. gingivalis was found to be very high (0.99-0.94) using culture as the reference detection method. the agreement between culture and immunofluorescence  in detecting the presence or absence of the investigated species was 85.2-88.1% for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia/p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and t. forsythia, 75.9% for a. actinomycetemcomitans and 70.4% for p. micros. conclusions: the microbial profile of the early onset/aggressive periodontitis population was complex. the agreement between the two detection methods was very high.

TI  == initial antimicrobial effect of controlled-release doxycycline in subgingival sites.
AB  == objectives: to determine the ability of a 10% doxycycline hyclate controlled-release polymer (atridox) to suppress periodontopathic bacteria when placed subgingivally following scaling and root planing (sc/rp). methods: eight males and seven females, mean age 48 years, with moderate to advanced periodontitis participated in the study. in each patient, bilateral periodontal pockets probing 6-7 mm were randomly assigned to treatment by sc/rp + doxycycline polymer or by sc/rp alone. subgingival placement of doxycycline polymer was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. sc/rp was performed with hand instruments for at least 10 min in each study tooth. subgingival samples were collected by paper-points at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks post-treatment. culture methodology was used to isolate and identify putative periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister pneumosintes, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter species, eubacterium species, fusobacterium species, peptostreptococcus micros, eikenella corrodens, staphylococcus species, enteric gram-negative rods, beta-hemolytic streptococci and yeasts. the microbiologic examination was carried out blindly. microbiological data were analyzed using a general linear model analysis of variance for within and between group effects. results: sites receiving sc/rp + doxycycline polymer and sites receiving sc/rp alone exhibited similar levels of periodontal pathogens at baseline and did not differ significantly in total viable counts and proportional recovery of periodontopathic bacteria post-treatment. conclusions: controlled-release doxycycline placed in moderate to deep periodontal pockets caused no significant additional reduction in the subgingival pathogenic microbiota compared to thorough sc/rp alone. since controlled-release doxycycline may not significantly suppress several subgingival pathogenic microorganisms and seems to possess no distinct advantage over broad-spectra, safe and inexpensive antiseptics, the rationale for its employment in periodontal therapy remains unclear.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.
