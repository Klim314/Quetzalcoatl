TI  == novel coating of surgical suture confers antimicrobial activity against porphyromonas gingivalis and enterococcus faecalis.
AB  == background: the oral cavity is colonized by >10(9) bacteria, many of which can increase heart disease risk when seeded into the bloodstream. most dentoalveolar  surgeries require the use of surgical sutures. suture placement and removal can increase the risk of postoperative infection and bacteremia. the aim of this study is to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of a novel quaternary ammonium compound, k21, when coated on different suture materials. methods: the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis and the endodontic species enterococcus faecalis were grown to early log phase and inoculated on enriched brucella blood agar, on which were placed identical lengths of surgical suture (chromic gut, polyester suture, silk, and nylon suture) and control unwaxed dental floss impregnated with k21 at 5%, 10%, 20%, and 25% volume/volume in ethanol vehicle. controls included the following: 1) sutures treated with vehicle; 2) untreated sutures; and 3) unwaxed floss. zones of inhibition in millimeters were measured at five randomized sites per suture/floss for each concentration and material used. mean +/- sd of zones of inhibition were calculated, and analysis of variance (p <0.05) was used to determine whether differences were statistically significant. results: the results indicate that k21-coated suture at concentrations ranging from 5% to 25%, depending on the type of suture, have antimicrobial activity for p. gingivalis and e. faecalis. nylon suture coated with k21 at 5%, 10%, 20%, and 25% resulted in zones ranging from 3  to 11 mm. polyester suture was more effective at lower k21 concentrations with 5% (p = 0.0031), 10% (p = 0.0011), and 20% (p = 0.0002), yielding 7.5, 8.3, and 10.5 mm zones of inhibition. k21-coated silk suture yielded significant zones of inhibition at 25% (p <0.0001), whereas chromic gut was effective at k21 concentrations of 5% (p = 0.0081) and 25% (p <0.0001). conclusion: it is concluded that k21-coated surgical sutures have antimicrobial activity for bacterial species of direct relevance to postoperative infection and bacteremia.

TI  == prevalence of enterococcus faecalis and porphyromonas gingivalis in infected root canals and their susceptibility to endodontic treatment procedures: a molecular study.
AB  == introduction: because apical periodontitis is recognizably an infectious disease, elimination or reduction of intracanal bacteria is of utmost importance for optimum treatment outcome. objective: the prevalence of enterococcus faecalis and porphyromonas gingivalis in infected root canals was studied also, the effect of  endodontic therapy by using intracanal medicaments, calcium hydroxide paste (ch)  or gutta-percha points containing calcium hydroxide (ch-gp) or chlorhexidine (chx-gp) on these microorganisms was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  assay. methods: fifty-one patients with chronic apical periodontitis were randomly allocated in one of the fol- lowing groups according to the intracanal medicament used: ch, ch-gp and chx-gp group. bacterial samples were taken upon access (s1), after chemomechanical instrumentation (s2) and after 15-day medication (s3). pcr assay was used to detect the presence of selected bacteria.  results: e. faecalis was detected in 49% (25/51) and p. gingivalis in 17.6% (9/51) of the samples. samples which showed no bacterial presence at s1 were excluded from further analysis. overall analysis of all 29 samples revealed significant differences between s1 and s2 (p < 0.001), s2 and s3 (p < 0.05), and  s1 and s3 (p < 0.001). when distinction was made between the intracanal medications, there was a significant difference in the number of pcr positive samples between s1 and 52, s1 and s3, but not between s2 and s3 samples. conclusion: e. faecalis is more prevalent than p. gingivalis in primary endodontic infection. intracanal medication in conduction with instrumentation and irrigation efficiently eliminates e. faecalis and p. gingivalis from infected root canals.

TI  == antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties of pgla-am1, cpf-am1, and magainin-am1: potent activity against oral pathogens.
AB  == cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides are intensively studied classes of host defence peptides (hdps). three peptides, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla-am1), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf-am1) and magainin-am1, originally isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the african volcano frog xenopus amieti (pipidae), were studied for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities against oral and respiratory pathogens. minimal effective concentrations (mecs), determined by radial diffusion assay, were generally lower than minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined by microbroth dilution. pgla-am1 and cpf-am1 were particularly active against streptococcus mutans and all three peptides were effective against fusobacterium  nucleatum, whereas enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans proved to be relatively resistant micro-organisms. a type strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa was shown to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate studied. pgla-am1 displayed the greatest propensity to bind lipopolysaccharide (lps) from escherichia coli, p. aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. all three peptides  showed less binding to p. gingivalis lps than to lps from the other species studied. oral fibroblast viability was unaffected by 50 mum peptide treatments. production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-8 by oral fibroblasts was significantly increased following treatment with 1 or 10 mum magainin-am1 but not following treatment with pgla-am1 or cpf-am1. in conclusion, as well as possessing potent antimicrobial actions, the x. amieti peptides bound to lps from three human pathogens and had no effect on oral fibroblast viability. cpf-am1 and pgla-am1 show promise as templates for the design of novel analogues for the treatment of oral and dental diseases associated with bacteria or fungi.

TI  == [study of association between parvimonas micra and pulp dominant pathogens in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis].
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of parvimonas micra (pm) and the associations  between pm and pulp dominant pathogens in order to reflect the colonization of pm in the infected root canals with chronic periradicular periodontitis. methods: a  total of 120 teeth diagnosed as chronic periradicular periodontitis from 104 patients were included into the study. the teeth were allocated into untreated (primary infectious) and root-canal- treated (secondary infectious) groups with 60 in either group. samples were collected from the root canals using sterile files and paper points, and subsequent extraction of bacterial dna was undertaken. the pm 16s rdna level was evaluated using 16s rdna pcr. the prevalence of pm in chronic periradicular periodontitis was determined accordingly. then, the associations of pm and enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas endodontalis (pe) as well as porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) were analysed. results: pm was detected in 40% (24/60) of the samples from the primary infectious group, 5% (3/60) from the secondary infectious group. the prevalences  of pm from the two groups were different significantly (chi(2) = 21.06, p < 0.05). significant correlations (untreated group or = 5.98, root-canal-treated group or = 33.50) between pm and pe were identified in both groups, while the correlations between pm and pg as well as ef were not of significance, respectively. conclusions: a significantly higher relevance ratio of pm was estimated in the primary infectious group than the secondary infectious one. pm and pe were correlated significantly in the infected root canals, suggesting a symbiotic relation between these two bacteria.

TI  == bimix antimicrobial scaffolds for regenerative endodontics.
AB  == introduction: eliminating and/or inhibiting bacterial growth within the root canal system has been shown to play a key role in the regenerative outcome. the aim of this study was to synthesize and determine in vitro both the antimicrobial effectiveness and cytocompatibility of bimix antibiotic-containing polydioxanone-based polymer scaffolds. methods: antibiotic-containing (metronidazole [met] and ciprofloxacin [cip]) polymer solutions (distinct antibiotic weight ratios) were spun into fibers as a potential mimic to the double antibiotic paste (dap, a met/cip mixture). fiber morphology, chemical characteristics, and tensile strength were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and tensile testing, respectively. antimicrobial efficacy was tested over time (aliquot collection) against enterococcus faecalis (ef), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). similarly, cytotoxicity was evaluated in human dental pulp stem cells. data were statistically analyzed (p < .05). results: scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed that electrospinning was able to produce antibiotic-containing fibers with a diameter mostly in the nanoscale. the tensile strength of 1:1met/cip scaffolds was significantly (p < .05) higher than pure polydioxanone (control). meanwhile, all other groups presented similar strength as the control. aliquots obtained from antibiotic-containing scaffolds inhibited the growth of ef, pg, and fn, except pure met, which did not show an inhibitory action toward pg or fn. antibiotic-containing aliquots promoted slight human dental pulp stem cell viability reduction, but none of them were considered to be cytotoxic. conclusions: our data suggest that the incorporation of multiple antibiotics within a nanofibrous scaffold holds great potential toward the development of a drug delivery system for regenerative endodontics.

TI  == microbial community in persistent apical periodontitis: a 16s rrna gene clone library analysis.
AB  == aim: to characterize the microbial composition of persistent periapical lesions of root filled teeth using a molecular genetics approach. methodology: apical lesion samples were collected from 12 patients (23-80 years old) who visited the  kyushu university hospital for apicectomy with persistent periapical lesions associated with root filled teeth. dna was directly extracted from each sample and the microbial composition was comprehensively analysed using clone library analysis of the 16s rrna gene. enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans and specific fima genotypes of porphyromonas gingivalis were confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis with specific primers. results: bacteria were detected in all samples, and the dominant findings were p. gingivalis (19.9%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.2%) and propionibacterium acnes (9%). bacterial diversity was greater in symptomatic lesions than in asymptomatic ones. in addition, the following bacteria or bacterial combinations were characteristic to symptomatic lesions: prevotella spp., treponema spp., peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113, olsenella uli, slackia exigua, selemonas infelix, p. gingivalis with type iv fima, and a combination of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and peptostreptococcaceae sp. hot-113 and predominance of streptococcus spp. on the other hand, neither enterococcus faecalis nor c. albicans were detected in any of the samples. conclusion: whilst a diverse bacterial species were observed in the  persistent apical lesions, some characteristic patterns of bacterial community were found in the symptomatic lesions. the diverse variation of community indicates that bacterial combinations as a community may cause persistent inflammation in periapical tissues rather than specific bacterial species.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == extension of bactericidal effect of sodium hypochlorite into dentinal tubules.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to determine the extent of disinfection mediated by 2 concentrations of sodium hypochlorite for bacteria-laden dentin wall of a root canal. methods: a dual-species film, enterococcus faecalis and porphyromonas gingivalis, was cultivated on root canal dentin for 7 days. the canal wall was irrigated with 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite (n = 8 each), with a control group (n = 2) irrigated with sterile saline. the roots were then split horizontally at 5-, 7-, and 9-mm levels from root apex and examined under confocal laser scanning microscope and then scanning electron microscope. the proportions of viable cells situated on different depths into root canal dentin were compared at a significance level of p = .05. results: both concentrations of sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced the amount of live bacteria in the most superficial layer (first 0.1 mm) of root canal dentin, compared with the control; however, the difference was not significant between the 2 concentrations. for the next 2 layers (0.1-0.3 mm into dentinal tubules), irrigation with 3% hypochlorite resulted in significantly lower amounts of viable bacteria than 0.5% hypochlorite or saline. no significant difference between 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite and the positive control was observed in deeper (>0.3 mm) regions into the root canal wall. conclusions: increasing the concentration of sodium hypochlorite improves the penetration depth of its antibacterial action into dentinal tubules, but that seemed unable to completely eradicate bacteria residing there. total elimination  of bacteria from dentinal tubules cannot be achieved by irrigation with sodium hypochlorite alone.

TI  == photodynamic therapy versus ultrasonic irrigation: interaction with endodontic microbial biofilm, an ex vivo study.
AB  == introduction: photodynamic therapy was introduced as an adjuvant to conventional  chemo-mechanical debridement during endodontic treatment to overcome the persistence of biofilms. the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of photodynamic therapy (pdt) to disrupt an experimental microbial biofilm inside the root canal in a clinically applicable working time. materials and methods: thirty extracted teeth were prepared and then divided in three groups. all samples were infected with an artificially formed biofilm made of enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia bacteria. first group was treated with aseptim plus(r) photo-activated (led) disinfection system, second group by a 650 nm diode laser and toluidine blue as photosensitizer, and the third group, as control group, by ultrasonic irrigation (pui) using edta 17% and naocl 2.6% solutions. the working time for all three groups was fixed at 3 min. presence or absence of biofilm was assessed  by aerobic and anaerobic cultures. results: there was no statistically significant difference between results obtained from groups treated by aseptim plus(r) and diode laser (p<0.6267). in cultures of both groups there was a maximal bacterial growth. the group that was treated by ultrasonic irrigation and naocl and edta solutions had the best results (p<0.0001): there was a statistically significant reduction of bacterial load and destruction of microbial biofilm. conclusion: under the condition of this study, photodynamic therapy could not disrupt endodontic artificial microbial biofilm and could not inhibit bacterial growth in a clinically favorable working time.

TI  == effectiveness of antibiotic medicaments against biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis and porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == introduction: in this study we compared the antibacterial effect of triple antibiotic paste (tap), double antibiotic paste (dap), and calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] against enterococcus faecalis and porphyromonas gingivalis biofilm. methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (mbic), and biofilm formation were measured by using microtiter plate methods. the 2 bacteria were treated with different dilutions of tap, dap, and ca(oh)2 solutions. the turbidities of the bacterial cultures in the microtiter plate were measured by optical density at 490 nm by using a spectrophotometer. data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance (alpha = 0.05). results: for tap, the mic and mbic values were 0.003 mg/ml for e. faecalis and 0.006 mg/ml for p. gingivalis. the mbc values for tap were 0.3 mg/ml for both bacteria. the mic and mbic values for  dap were 0.001 mg/ml for e. faecalis and p. gingivalis. the mbc values for dap were 0.14 mg/ml for both bacteria. biofilm formation of the 2 bacteria was significantly decreased with tap and dap at all tested dilutions (p < .0001) compared with control groups; however, tap and dap biofilm formations were not significantly different from each other. ca(oh)2 significantly decreased bacterial biofilm formation compared with the control, but it was significantly less than tap and dap (p < .05). conclusions: both tap and dap were more effective than ca(oh)2 against e. faecalis and p. gingivalis. dap can be considered an effective and comparable antibacterial substitute for tap.

TI  == bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds for regenerative endodontics.
AB  == here we report the synthesis, materials characterization, antimicrobial capacity, and cytocompatibility of novel antibiotic-containing scaffolds. metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin/(cip) was mixed with a polydioxanone (pds)polymer solution at 5 and 25 wt% and processed into fibers. pds fibers served as a control. scanning electron microscopy (sem), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), tensile testing, and high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) were used to assess fiber morphology, chemical structure, mechanical properties, and drug release, respectively. antimicrobial properties were evaluated against those of porphyromonas gingivalis/pg and enterococcus faecalis/ef. cytotoxicity was assessed in human dental pulp stem cells (hdpscs). statistics were performed, and significance was set at the 5% level. sem imaging revealed a submicron fiber diameter. ftir confirmed antibiotic incorporation. the tensile values of hydrated 25 wt% cip scaffold were significantly lower than those of all other groups. analysis of hplc data confirmed gradual, sustained drug release from the scaffolds over 48 hrs. cip-containing scaffolds significantly (p < .00001) inhibited biofilm growth of both bacteria. conversely, met-containing scaffolds inhibited only pg growth. agar diffusion confirmed the antimicrobial properties against specific bacteria for the antibiotic-containing scaffolds. only the 25 wt% cip-containing scaffolds were cytotoxic. collectively, this study suggests that polymer-based antibiotic-containing electrospun scaffolds could function as  a biologically safe antimicrobial drug delivery system for regenerative endodontics.

TI  == [analysis of antimicrobial effect of mtad solution in infected root canal system  using pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: clinically acceptable antiseptic should possess organolithic-mineralolithic properties and antimicrobial efficacy, and should be  non-toxic. objective: the aim of the paper was to assess the presence of genomes  of the most common microorganisms (porphyromonas gingivalis, agregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tanerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and enterococcus faecalis) in infected tooth root canals before and after rinsing with solution of doxycycline, citric acid and detergent tween-80 (mtad) in patients with clinically diagnosed primary apex periodontitis. methods: the content of primarily infected canals before and after using the mtad solution was used as a biological material in which the presence of microorganisms dna was proved. for the detection of bacterial genome the multiplex pcr technique was applied. results: the percentage of positive samples before canal treatment was 100%. in infected root canals e. faecalis was most dominant (37%). in a relatively high percentage we detected p. intermedia (25%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (20%), t. denticola (17%), t. forsythensis (15%) and p. gingivalis (10%). after rinsing the canal system using mtad solution, there was a statistically significant decrease in e. faecalis (12%), p. intermedia (0%), t forsythensis (0%) and p. gingivalis (0%). the presence of other bacteria was also diminished but not statistically significantly. conclusion: with the application  of multiplex pcr technique which provided a simultaneous amplification of various genomic sequences, using several pairs of primers, the most dominant in infected  root canals were e. faecalis. p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, t. denticola, t. forsythensis and p. gingivalis. after mechanic treatment and irrigation of root canals with mtad solution, p. intermedia, p. gingivalis and t  forsythensis were not found. the presence of e. faecalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. denticola was diminished, however, not statistically significantly.

TI  == antibacterial effect of different root canal sealers on three bacterial species.
AB  == objective: bacteria persisting in the root canal system may thwart endodontic therapy. it is therefore interesting to know whether clinically available root canal sealers have an antimicrobial effect. the objective of the present in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of various sealers on the endodontologically detectable species enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). methods: the antibacterial effectiveness of the sealers was tested by means of the agar diffusion test (adt) and the direct contact test (dct). eight different sealers (ah plus((r)), hermetic((r)), roekoseal((r)), sealapex((r)), apexit plus((r)), 2seal((r)), endorez((r)) and proroot mta((r))) and two temporary sealers (calxyl((r)) and gangraena merz((r))) were tested. at first, 100mul of bacterial suspension (bs) of each individual micro-organism (optical density (od) 0.5) was applied separately to schaedler agar plates for the adt. subsequently, freshly mixed and set sealer was applied. after 48h of incubation, the inhibition zones were measured. further, 18mg of sealer were put  into each well of 48-well cell culture plates and overlaid with 400mul of schaedler liquid medium and 100mul of bs (od 0.5) in monoculture. bacterial growth was determined by the dct from the optical density of the liquid by photospectrometry after 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24h. results: for the application, the sealer hermetic((r)), a significant suppression of the species e. faecalis, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis was detected in both the adt and the dct. ah plus((r)) showed a suppressive effect on e. faecalis and f. nucleatum in the dct. with all other sealers tested, e. faecalis was not suppressible. roekoseal((r)),  calxyl((r)) and gangraena-merz((r)) showed no antibacterial effect on the tested  species whatsoever. significance: we have shown in both adt and dct that some root canal sealers suppress the growth of e. faecalis in vitro.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == bactericidal activity and oral pathogen inactivation by electromagnetic wave irradiation.
AB  == aims: the aim of this work was to clarify the effects of electromagnetic wave irradiation (emwi) on oral bacterial pathogens. methods and results: a gram-negative (porphyromonas gingivalis) or gram-positive (streptococcus mutans,  s. intermedius, enterococcus faecalis) bacterial suspension was irradiated by emw apparatus (500-1000 khz, 5-15 times, 1 s time(-1) ). quantification of survival bacteria by cfu counting revealed that emwi exhibited marked bactericidal activity against all tested bacteria and bactericidal activity at 500 khz increased in an irradiation number-dependent manner. after emwi at 500 khz, scanning electron microscopic observations showed that the chain of s. mutans cells was shortened after 5 irradiations and the outlines of bacterial cells (s.  mutans and p. gingivalis) were unclear after 5-10 irradiations. emwi inhibited the inductive effect of s. mutans on pro-inflammatory cytokine production in human monocytes and this inhibitory effect was comparable with that of heat-killed bacteria. furthermore, using an enzyme activity assay, emwi partially inactivated the activities of gingipains from p. gingivalis. conclusions: these findings demonstrated that emwi has inactivation and bactericidal activities against single microbial species among four kinds of oral pathogens. significance and impact of the study: electromagnetic wave irradiation may be applicable for medical disinfection and sterilization, such as refractory periapical periodontitis.

TI  == clustering behavior in microbial communities from acute endodontic infections.
AB  == introduction: acute endodontic infections harbor heterogeneous microbial communities in both the root canal (rc) system and apical tissues. data comparing the microbial structure and diversity in endodontic infections in related ecosystems, such as rc with necrotic pulp and acute apical abscess (aaa), are scarce in the literature. the aim of this study was to examine the presence of selected endodontic pathogens in paired samples from necrotic rc and aaa using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) followed by the construction of cluster profiles. methods: paired samples of rc and aaa exudates were collected from 20 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of selected strict and facultative anaerobic strains. the frequency of species was compared between the rc and the aaa samples. a stringent neighboring clustering algorithm was applied to investigate  the existence of similar high-order groups of samples. a dendrogram was constructed to show the arrangement of the sample groups produced by the hierarchical clustering. results: all samples harbored bacterial dna. porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella nigrescens, filifactor alocis, and tannerela forsythia were frequently detected in both rc and aaa samples. the selected anaerobic species were distributed in diverse small bacteria consortia.  the samples of rc and aaa that presented at least one of the targeted microorganisms were grouped in small clusters. conclusions: anaerobic species were frequently detected in acute endodontic infections and heterogeneous microbial communities with low clustering behavior were observed in paired samples of rc and aaa.

TI  == comparison of bacterial adhesion and cellular proliferation on newly developed three-dimensional scaffolds manufactured by rapid prototyping technology.
AB  == scaffolds used in the field of tissue engineering should facilitate the adherence, spreading, and ingrowth of cells as well as prevent microbial adherence. for the first time, this study simultaneously deals with microbial and tissue cell adhesion to rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds. the cell growth  of human osteosarcoma cells (cal-72) over a time period of 3-11 days were examined on three scaffolds (plga, plla, plla-tcp) and compared to the adhesion of salivary microorganisms and representative germs of the oral flora (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, candida albicans, enterococcus  faecalis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguinis). scanning electron microscopy (sem), cell proliferation measurements, and determination of the colony forming units (cfu) were performed. the cell proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp after 3, 7, and 11 days of cultivation were higher than on plga. on  day 3 the proliferation rates on plla and plla-tcp, and on day 5 on plla-tcp, proved to be significantly higher compared to that of the control (culture plate). the strain which showed the most cfus on all of the investigated scaffolds was p. gingivalis, followed by e. faecalis. no significant cfu differences were determined examining p. gingivalis among the biomaterials. in contrast, e. faecalis was significantly more adherent to plga and plla compared to plla-tcp. the lowest cfu values were seen with c. albicans and p. nigrescens.  salivary born aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms adhered significantly more to  plga compared to plla-tcp. these results supported by sem point out the high potential of plla-tcp in the field of tissue engineering.

TI  == short-term antimicrobial properties of mineral trioxide aggregate with incorporated silver-zeolite.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether adding silver-zeolite (sz) to mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) would enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta against staphylococcus aureus (atcc #25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc #29212), escherichia coli (atcc#25922), pseudomonas aeruginosa (atcc #27853), candida albicans (atcc #90028), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc #33277), actinomyces israelii (atcc #12102), and prevotella intermedia (atcc# 15032). sz was added at 0.2% and 2% mass fraction concentration to mta powder. the control group was mta powder with no sz. the antimicrobial effect test was accomplished by placing freshly mixed mta specimens on agar plates inoculated with microorganisms and comparing the zones of inhibition at 24, 48, and 72 h. the amounts of silver ion release from mta specimens were measured with atomic absorption spectrophotometry at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. the ph of mta specimens was measured with a ph meter at 10-min, 24-, 48-, and 72-h periods. mta with 2% and 0.2% sz specimens showed inhibitory effects on some microorganisms at all time periods, whereas no antimicrobial activity showed for p. intermedia and  a. israelii. mta without sz inhibited c. albicans, e. coli, and p. intermedia. the highest silver release was detected in 2% sz mta at 24 h. the incorporation of sz may enhance the antimicrobial activity of mta.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == study of the direct bactericidal effect of nd:yag and diode laser parameters used in endodontics on pigmented and nonpigmented bacteria.
AB  == laser light can be used during endodontic procedures to sterilize the root canal  by destroying bacteria. previous in-vitro studies that investigated the mechanism of the destruction of bacteria inhabiting the root canal by 1,064-nm nd:yag and 808-nm diode laser light used substrates that absorb light in the near-infrared (nir) spectrum. these substrates heat the bacterial microenvironment, which possibly contributes to cell death. to determine the direct effect of laser light on the bacterial sample in the absence of detrimental heating, a sapphire substrate, which is virtually transparent in nir spectrum, was inoculated with bacterial samples and subjected to laser irradiation at 1,064 nm (1.5 w, 15 hz) and at 808 nm (1.5 w, 20 hz). enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria were used. e. faecalis and e. coli were largely unaffected by laser light. the viability of p. gingivalis, a pigmented bacterium, was directly affected by both nir wavelengths (a 57% decrease of viability at 1,064 nm and a 31% decrease at 808 nm). our results indicate that the primary mediator of cell death appears to be the interaction between nir laser light and  the bacterial microenvironment, most likely in the form of heating. our research  suggests that when optimizing the efficacy of laser-assisted endodontic sterilization of the root canal, the optical characteristics of the bacterial microenvironment play a key role, as nonpigmented bacteria appear to be virtually transparent at 808 nm and 1,064 nm.

TI  == contemporary root canal irrigants are able to disrupt and eradicate single- and dual-species biofilms.
AB  == introduction: clinical/microbiological studies have consistently revealed the persistence of some bacteria after conventional root canal debridement. although  this was originally attributed to the complexity of the root canal anatomy and the difficulty of delivering antibacterial agents effectively, it has emerged that the biofilm encasement of bacterial cells may confer a further mechanism of  resistance. the purpose of this study was to investigate the relative disruption  and bactericidal effects of root canal irrigants on single- and dual-species biofilms of root canal isolates. methods: biofilms of streptococcus sanguinis, enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis were grown on nitrocellulose membranes for 72 hours and immersed in naocl, edta, chlorhexidine, and iodine for 1, 5, or 10 minutes. the number of viable and nonviable bacteria disrupted from the biofilm and those remaining adherent were determined by using a viability stain in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy. results: gram-negative obligate anaerobe species were more susceptible to cell removal than gram-positive facultative anaerobes. the majority of cells were disrupted after the first minute of exposure; however, the extent varied according to the agent and species. the most effective agent at disrupting biofilms was naocl. iodine was generally effective at bacterial killing but not disruption. conclusions: biofilm disruption and cell viability were influenced by the species, their coassociation in dual-species biofilms, the test agent, and the duration of exposure. the effectiveness of naocl as an endodontic irrigant was reinforced.

TI  == proteomic analysis of endodontic infections by liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry.
AB  == introduction: endodontic infections are very prevalent and have a polymicrobial etiology characterized by complex interrelationships between endodontic microorganisms and the host defenses. proteomic analysis of endodontic infections can provide global insights into the invasion, pathogenicity mechanisms, and multifactorial interactions existing between root canal bacteria and the host in  the initiation and progression of apical periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to apply proteomic techniques such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) for the identification of proteins of bacterial origin present in endodontic infections. methods: endodontic specimens were aseptically  obtained from seven patients with root canal infections. protein mixtures were subjected to tryptic in-solution digestion and analysed by reverse-phase nano-lc-ms/ms followed by a database search. results: proteins, mainly of cell wall or membrane origin, from endodontic bacteria especially enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola were identified from all the samples tested. identified proteins included adhesins, autolysins, proteases, virulence factors,  and antibiotic-resistance proteins. conclusions: lc-ms/ms offers a sensitive analytical platform to study the disease processes in the root canal environment. the array of proteins expressed in endodontic infections reflects the complex microbial presence and highlights the bacterial species involved in the inflammatory process.

TI  == tgf-beta1 inhibits tlr-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  == tgf-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. odontoblasts  extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from tgf-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. this study aimed to determine the role of tgf-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. we show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors tlr2 and tlr4 on the cell surface. porphyromonas  gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum activated both tlrs, but tlr4 played a greater role. lack of cell-surface tlr2 was associated with poor response to streptococcus mutans, enterococcus faecalis, and lactobacillus casei. tgf-beta1 inhibited tlr2 and tlr4 expression and attenuated  odontoblast responses. our findings suggest that the balance between tlr-mediated inflammation and tgf-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in  pulpal inflammation.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine by two different  tests.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial capacity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%) with or without the addition of organic material (bovine serum albumin, bsa) against some bacterial samples (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum) using two activity tests (contact and diffusion agar tests). in the contact test (first model), bacterial samples were kept in contact with each irrigating solution for different time intervals: immediately (t(0)), 5 min (t(5)), 15 min (t(15)) and 30 min (t(30)). the agar diffusion test was the second model used. in half the specimens, 0.5% bsa was added to simulate organic tissue present in the root canal. bacterial growth was evaluated for each microorganism and activity test. each test was repeated 10 times. in the contact test, 0.12% chlorhexidine solution (chx) did not eliminate e. faecalis at any tested time. chx at 0.5% eliminated all strains except e. faecalis after immediate contact. all strains were eliminated by 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl. bsa did not interfere with the  antimicrobial activity of the irrigating solutions. in the agar diffusion test, all solutions exhibited zones of antimicrobial activity; however, bsa interfered  with the antimicrobial activity of naocl and chx. under the condition of the contact test, the 0.12% chx was ineffective in eliminating e. faecalis, while 0.5% chx, 1% chx, 1% naocl and 5% naocl showed antibacterial effectiveness against all the tested bacterial strains. the addition of an organic load interfered with the accuracy of the agar diffusion test.

TI  == comparative study of the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gel, chlorhexidine solution and sodium hypochlorite as endodontic irrigants.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the in vitro the antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine gluconate gel as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance compared to sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and chlorhexidine gluconate solution. the antimicrobial efficacy of the tested substances was evaluated using the agar diffusion test. the growth inhibition zones produced by 0.2%, 1% and 2% chlorhexidine gel were evaluated against 5 facultative anaerobic bacteria and 4 pigmented gram-negative anaerobes, and compared to the results obtained by naocl  and chlorhexidine solution. the largest growth inhibition zones were produced when the test bacteria were in contact with 2% chlorhexidine gluconate gel (11.79 mm), being significantly different (p<0.05) from the growth inhibition zones produced by all naocl concentrations, including 5.25% (9.54 mm). however, there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the growth inhibition zones obtained with equal concentrations of chlorhexidine solution and gel. the results of this study indicate that, as far as its antimicrobial properties are concerned, chlorhexidine gel has a great potential to be used as an endodontic auxiliary chemical substance.

TI  == bacterial and candida albicans adhesion on rapid prototyping-produced 3d-scaffolds manufactured as bone replacement materials.
AB  == rapid prototyping (rp)-produced scaffolds are gaining increasing importance in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. microbial adhesion on the surface of replacement materials has a strong influence on healing and long-term outcome. consequently, it is important to examine the adherence of microorganisms on rp-produced scaffolds. this research focussed on manufacturing of scaffolds by 3d-bioplotting and examination of their microbial adhesion characteristics. tricalciumphosphate (tcp), calcium/sodium alginate, and poly(lactide-co-glycolic  acid) (plga) constructs were produced and used to study the adhesion of dental pathogens. six oral bacterial strains, one candida strain and human saliva were used for the adhesion studies. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were determined and scanning electron microscopy (sem) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) were performed. microorganisms adhered to all scaffolds. all strains, except for streptococcus oralis, adhered best to plga scaffolds. streptococcus oralis adhered to each of the biomaterials equally. streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis adhered best to plga scaffolds, followed by alginate and tcp. prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus  sanguis, and candida albicans showed the highest adherence to plga, followed by tcp and alginate. in contrast, the microorganisms of saliva adhered significantly better to tcp, followed by plga and alginate. sem observations correlated with the results of the cfu determinations. clsm detected bacteria within deeper sheets of alginate. in conclusion, because of the high adherence rate of oral pathogens to the scaffolds, the application of these biomaterials for bone replacement in oral surgery could result in biomaterial-related infections. strategies to decrease microbial adherence and to prevent infections due to oral  pathogens are discussed.

TI  == effect of tissue fluids on hydrophobicity and adherence of enterococcus faecalis  to dentin.
AB  == this in vitro study was carried out to determine (1) the hydrophobicity of selected oral bacteria, (2) the influence of growth media (saliva and serum) and  mode of growth (planktonic or biofilm) on the hydrophobicity of enterococcus faecalis, and (3) the influence of growth media and conditioning fluids on the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the ability to bind to a hydrocarbon phase (xylene) was used as an index of relative hydrophobicity of cells. fluorescent microscopy-based technique was used to assay the bacterial adherence to dentin. results showed that bacteria involved in the primary stage of oral biofilm formation such as streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis are relatively more hydrophobic than e. faecalis. the hydrophobicity of e. faecalis was significantly increased during starvation and biofilm mode of growth (p < .05). the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin was appreciably increased after starvation and when dentin was conditioned with saliva. it was observed that surface conditioning of dentin with saliva and starvation can enhance the adherence of e. faecalis to dentin. the findings from  this study indicated that the coronal leakage of saliva and the physiologic state of microbes might play an important role in the adherence and biofilm formation of bacteria to root canal dentin.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of triclosan and triclosan with gantrez on five common endodontic pathogens.
AB  == microbial control of the root canal system is one of the key objectives of root canal therapy. triclosan is a widely accepted broad spectrum antimicrobial agent  proven to be effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. triclosan acts by blocking bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. the addition of gantrez copolymer has been shown to enhance the antimicrobial activity of triclosan. the purpose of this study was to determine the minimum inhibitory and  bactericidal concentrations of triclosan and triclosan with gantrez against prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, and enterococcus faecalis. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of both test solutions was determined for each of the 5 microorganisms by using microtiter serial dilutions. samples were streaked on 5%  sheep blood agar plates and placed in an anaerobic incubator to determine the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc). the mbc of triclosan ranged from 12-94  microg/ml. the mbc of triclosan with gantrez ranged from <0.3-10.4 microg/ml. the addition of gantrez enhanced the bactericidal activity of triclosan. both triclosan and triclosan with gantrez demonstrated bactericidal activity against the 5 specific endodontic pathogens.

TI  == sensitivity of oral bacteria to 254 nm ultraviolet light.
AB  == aim: to explore the sensitivity of bacteria commonly found in root canals to 254  nm ultraviolet (uv) light, either as individual cells or as participants of a bacterial multilayer. methodology: the sensitivity of oral bacteria, as individual cells, to uv light was tested by subjecting plates streaked with bacteria to 254 nm uv, at a fluence of 1-20 mj cm(-2). an experimental model was  designed to produce a bacterial multilayer and to study absorption of uv light by bacteria in an outer layer and its effect on the elimination of bacteria in the inner layer. results: direct exposure to relatively low doses of uv light (2-7 mj cm(-2)) effectively eliminated all bacterial strains tested. furthermore, an enterococcus faecalis strain, partially resistant to a 24 h exposure to calcium hydroxide, was effectively eliminated within several seconds of exposure to uv light (p < 0.001). uv was absorbed by a multilayer of bacteria. when 4 bacterial  cells microm(-2) were present in the light path, the uv light dose had to be increased by a factor of x10 to achieve 100% elimination of the bacteria in an inner layer. conclusions: the application of uv light to eliminate endodontic pathogens may be possible. nevertheless, its absorbance by outer layers of bacteria should be considered and the uv light dose adapted accordingly.

TI  == clinical and microbiological profiles of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive brazilians undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy and hiv-seronegative brazilians with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study compares the periodontal clinical profile and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-seropositive and hiv-seronegative subjects with chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 172 subjects were distributed into two hiv-seropositive groups (37 chronic periodontitis [h+cp+] and 35 periodontally healthy [h+cp-] individuals) and two hiv-seronegative groups (49 chronic periodontitis [h-cp+] and 51 periodontally healthy [h-cp-] subjects). subgingival samples were collected from six sites with the deepest probing depth in the periodontitis groups and six random sites in the groups with periodontal health. all hiv-infected patients had undergone highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart)  for at least 2 years. the presence and levels of 33 bacterial species were detected by dna probes and the checkerboard method. kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney tests were used to seek for significant differences among and between groups. results: h-cp+ patients showed significantly more periodontal destruction and inflammation than h+cp+ patients, whereas h+cp- subjects presented a greater percentage of sites with bleeding than h-cp- subjects (p <0.01). patients who were hiv seronegative showed higher prevalence and levels of most bacterial species than hiv seropositive patients. periodontal pathogens including tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas noxia were more frequently detected in h-cp+ subjects compared to h+cp+ and controls. in contrast, enterococcus faecalis and acinetobacter baumannii were more commonly found in hiv-infected than in non-hiv-infected subjects (p <0.05). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens are more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of hiv-seronegative patients with chronic periodontitis, whereas species not usually associated with periodontitis are detected in higher frequency in hiv-seropositive subjects under haart.

AB  == aim: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 2.5% and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite and 2.0% chlorhexidine gel and liquid as endodontic-irrigating substances against selected single-species biofilms. methods: single-species biofilms of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were generated on a cellulose nitrate membrane placed on  agar medium. the biofilms were then immersed in the endodontic-irrigating substances for 30 s and also for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min, with and without mechanical agitation. sterile saline was used as control. after each time period, the membrane filters were then transferred to tubes containing 2 ml of fresh broth medium plus neutralizers (in order to prevent the residual action of the tested substances). the micro-organisms were suspended using a vortex, and the inoculum was serially diluted 10-fold. aliquots of the dilutions were plated on 5% sheep blood agar medium, and incubated under adequate gaseous conditions. colony-forming units were calculated. the samples were compared using the friedman and tukey test, when necessary, at a significance level of p < 0.05. results: mechanical agitation promoted the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents, resulting in less time to eliminate the same micro-organisms, except for  s. aureus with 2.5% naocl. antimicrobial agents in liquid presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine, killed the tested micro-organisms more rapidly. saline did not inhibit the growth of any of the tested micro-organisms, with or without agitation, being statistically different (p < 0.05) from naocl and chlorhexidine. p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, p. endodontalis and f. nucleatum were eliminated in 30 s by all antimicrobial agents, with our without agitation, in contrast with the facultative and aerobe strains. conclusions: mechanical agitation improved the antimicrobial properties of the chemical substances tested using a biofilm model, favouring the agents in liquid  presentation, especially 5.25% naocl and 2% chlorhexidine.

AB  == background/aims: the presence of selected bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. the null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial  strain, was tested. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54  patients with endodontic disease. for each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (aap, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (cap, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (eap, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). seventy-one percent of cases were primary  endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). pcr assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. results: t. denticola and e. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), p. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), p. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and t. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). t. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth  with eap. e. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with cap and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. statistical analysis demonstrated an association of cap and  secondary endodontic infection with the presence of e. faecalis. (p<0.01). eap was associated with the presence of t. denticola (p<0.01). conclusion: t. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. e. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. we suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.

AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == geographical differences in bacteria detected in endodontic infections using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is an innovative nucleic acid-based assay that has the highest sensitivity of any microbiological technique for the detection of bacteria. the purpose of this study was to use pcr to detect the presence of specific species of bacteria in samples collected from two geographical locations. microbial samples from abscesses of endodontic origin were collected from patients in portland, oregon, and rio de janeiro, brazil. pcrs with species-specific oligonucleotide primers for the 16s ribosomal rna gene were used for detection of the bacteria after dna extraction from each clinical sample. statistical analysis revealed that there was a significant difference in  detection of the bacteria between the two geographical locations for prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, fusobacterium nucleatum,  and porphyromonas gingivalis, but not for porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium necrophorum, and enterococcus faecalis. these results suggest that  differences in bacteria detected or cultured in studies can be associated with geographical location.

TI  == association of t cd4 lymphocyte levels and subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in hiv-infected brazilians under haart.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis and different t cd4 lymphocyte levels under haart. study design: 64 hiv+ patients (mean age 34.5 +/- 7.3; 75% males) were distributed into group i: chronic periodontitis (> or = 3 sites with  probing pocket depth (ppd) and/or clinical attachment level (cal) > or = 5 mm); and group ii: periodontal health (no sites with ppd > 3 mm and/or cal > 4 mm). all subjects received conventional periodontal therapy. periodontal clinical parameters were evaluated at 6 sites/tooth in all teeth at baseline and 4 months  after therapy. the levels of t cd4 were obtained from the patient's medical record. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the 6 sites with the largest pocket depth in each subject of group i, and 6 randomly selected sites in subjects of group ii. the presence of 22 subgingival species was determined using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. significant microbiological differences within and among groups were sought using wilcoxon signed-rank and mann-whitney tests, respectively. relationships between t cd4 levels and microbiological parameters were determined using kruskal-wallis test. results: sixty-one percent of the hiv-infected patients represented aids cases, although 69% of them were periodontally healthy. the t cd4 lymphocyte mean level was 333 cells/mm3 and viral load was 12,815 +/- 24,607 copies/mm3. yet, the prevalence of chronic periodontitis was relatively low (36%). several periodontal pathogens, in particular t. forsythensis (p < .05), were more prevalent in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis than in hiv-positive subjects with periodontal health. most of the species decreased in frequency after therapy, particularly p. gingivalis (p < .05). e. faecalis and f. nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in the subgingival microbiota of patients with chronic periodontitis and lower levels of t cd4 (p < .05), while beneficial species tended to be more frequently detected in individuals with t cd4 counts over 500 cells/mm3. conclusion: the subgingival microbiota of hiv-infected patients with chronic periodontitis include a high prevalence of classical periodontal pathogens observed in non-infected individuals. furthermore, the severe immunosuppression seems to favor the colonization by these species, as well as by species not commonly found in the subgingival microbiota.

TI  == microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. methods: microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. results: a total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. the anaerobes most frequently isolated were: peptostreptococcus micros (35%), fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). the root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. on the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. suggested relationships were found between  anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (p<0.05). in particular, associations were  found between: a) pain (n=29) and p. micros (p<0.01), p. intermedia/nigrescens and eubacterium spp. (both p<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and p. micros (p<0.01) porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and porphyromonas spp. (p<0.01), peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and peptostreptococcus spp. (p<0.01), porphyromonas and enterococcus spp. (p<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and  porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and porphyromonas, peptostreptococcus and fusobacterium spp. (p<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus spp., p. micros, f. necrophorum (p<0.05). conclusions: our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. they also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine and sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the antimicrobial activity of 0.2%, 1%, and 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx gel and chx liquid), against endodontic pathogens and compare the results with the ones achieved by 0.5%, 1%,  2.5%, 4%, and 5.25% sodium hypochlorite (naocl). a broth dilution test was performed, and the timing for irrigants to kill microbial cells was recorded and  statistically analyzed. both 2.0% gel and liquid formulations eliminated staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans in 15 seconds, whereas the gel formulation killed enterococcus faecalis in 1 minute. all tested irrigants eliminated porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia in 15 seconds. the timing required for 1.0% and 2.0% chx liquid to eliminate all microorganisms was the same required for 5.25% naocl. the antimicrobial action is related to type, concentration, and presentation form of  the irrigants as well as the microbial susceptibility.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of naocl and chlorhexidine using a contact test.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to analyze the in vitro antimicrobial activity of sodium hypochlorite (1% and 5%) and chlorhexidine (0.12%, 0.5% and 1%). bacterial samples (atcc) of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum were submitted to a contact  test. solutions were evaluated at different time intervals: immediately, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min after contact and repeated 10 times. the results of the contact test showed that 0.12% chlorhexidine did not eliminate e. faecalis at any time interval, while 0.5% and 1% chlorhexidine and 1% and 5% sodium hypochlorite  did. these results permit us to conclude that to obtain better antimicrobial activity, chlorhexidine in a concentration greater than 0.12% should be used.

TI  == additive antimicrobial activity of calcium hydroxide and chlorhexidine on common  endodontic bacterial pathogens.
AB  == it is an established procedure to use calcium hydroxide [ca(oh)2] as a therapeutic component to achieve sterilization of infected root canals. unfortunately, some bacterial species are relatively resistant to ca(oh)2 and are therefore associated with treatment failures. the objective of this study was to  identify combinations of substances that improve antimicrobial activity. ca(oh)2  was used as a suspension or as a component of gutta-percha points. efficacy of killing was compared for (a) ca(oh)2 suspension alone; (b) zinc oxide (zno) points alone; (c) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno points; (d) ca(oh)2 suspension combined with zno/chlorhexidine points; and (e) ca(oh)2 points combined with zno/chlorhexidine points. common endodontopathogenic bacterial species (enterococcus faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus intermedius) in pure cultures served as target organisms. in the in vitro assay, the antibacterial substances and approximately 10(7) colony forming units of test bacteria were co-incubated in diluted human serum under growth conditions appropriate for the single bacterial species. samples were taken on days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 of incubation and viable counts determined. gram-negative bacteria were sufficiently killed by  ca(oh)2 alone. combinations with other agents did not improve the killing kinetics. for the inactivation of the gram-positive bacteria p. micros and s. intermedius, a combination of ca(oh)2 and zno/chlorhexidine, killed the bacteria  faster than ca(oh)2 alone. for e. faecalis, combining ca(oh)2 suspension with zno/chlorhexidine points lead to a faster decrease in the overall number of viable bacteria, but no test conditions lead to the complete loss of culture viability. the results of this study support the use of a combination of ca(oh)2  and chlorhexidine for faster eradication of p. micros and s. intermedius from infected root canals.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water as an endodontic irrigation solution.
AB  == aim: the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of electro-chemically activated water (eca) as an endodontic irrigation solution. methodology: the root canals of 60 caries-free, single-rooted, adult, maxillary, anterior human teeth were instrumented and irrigated in a similar method to that used for in vivo root canal treatment. the  external root surface of each tooth was sealed, maintaining the access cavities patent and the root canals were inoculated with a suspension containing four bacteria. the teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n = 15). each group was irrigated ultrasonically with one of the following solutions: distilled water (control), naocl (3.5%), and eca, the latter at phs 7.0 and 9.0. antimicrobial effectiveness was established directly after irrigation and again 7 days later, by counting colony-forming units on blood agar plates and by spectrophotometric analysis. results: large numbers of bacteria were present in the canals of teeth  irrigated with distilled water. no bacteria were observed following irrigation with naocl. neither of the eca solutions were found to be effective against all the bacteria. although some reduction in the number of bacteria was evident in the eca groups, this was not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when compared to sodium hypochlorite. conclusion: within the confines of this study eca did not demonstrate antimicrobial effectiveness.

TI  == role of the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein in the development of porphyromonas gingivalis biofilms on streptococcal substrates.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is an aggressive periodontal pathogen that persists in the mixed-species plaque biofilm on tooth surfaces. p. gingivalis cells attach to the plaque commensal streptococcus gordonii and this coadhesion event leads to the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. binding of these organisms is multimodal, involving both the p. gingivalis major fimbrial fima protein and the  species-specific interaction of the minor fimbrial mfa1 protein with the streptococcal sspb protein. this study examined the contribution of the mfa1-sspb interaction to p. gingivalis biofilm formation. p. gingivalis biofilms readily formed on substrata of s. gordonii dl1 but not on streptococcus mutans cells which lack a coadhesion-mediating homologue of sspb. an insertional inactivation  of the mfa1 gene in p. gingivalis resulted in a phenotype deficient in s. gordonii binding and unable to form biofilms. furthermore, analysis using recombinant streptococci and enterococci showed that p. gingivalis biofilms formed on enterococcus faecalis strains expressing sspb or translational fusions  of sspb with spap (the non-adherent sspb homologue in s. mutans) containing the p. gingivalis adherence domain (sspb adherence region, bar) of sspb. in contrast, an isogenic ssp null mutant of s. gordonii dl1 was unable to support biofilm growth, even though this strain bound to p. gingivalis fima at levels similar to  wild-type s. gordonii dl1. finally, site-specific mutation of two functional amino acid residues in bar resulted in sspb polypeptides that did not promote the development of p. gingivalis biofilms. these results suggest that the induction of p. gingivalis biofilms on a streptococcal substrate requires functional sspb-minor fimbriae interactions.

TI  == discrete protein determinant directs the species-specific adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis to oral streptococci.
AB  == for pathogens to survive in the human oral cavity, they must identify a suitable  niche in the complex multispecies biofilm that exists on oral tissues. the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis adheres to streptococcus gordonii by interacting with a specific region of the streptococcal sspb polypeptide, designated bar. however, it does not adhere to streptococcus mutans, which expresses spap, a highly conserved homolog of sspb. comparison of the predicted secondary structure of bar with the corresponding region of spap suggested that the substitution of asn for gly1182 and val for pro1185 in sspb may confer a unique local structure that is not conserved in spap. a synthetic peptide of 26 amino acids that encompassed residues 1167 to 1193 of sspb promoted avid adherence of p. gingivalis, whereas a peptide derived from the region corresponding to bar in spap was inactive. substitution of gly1182 and pro1185 for asn1182 and val1185 in sspb by site-specific mutation generated proteins that were predicted to assume an spap-like secondary structure, and the purified proteins did not promote p. gingivalis adherence. furthermore, enterococcus faecalis strains expressing the site-specific mutants did not support adherence of p. gingivalis cells. in contrast, p. gingivalis adhered efficiently to e. faecalis strains expressing intact sspb or sspb-spap chimeric proteins containing bar. these results suggest that a region of sspb consisting of 26 amino acids is  sufficient to mediate the adherence of p. gingivalis to s. gordonii and that the  species specificity of adherence arises from its interaction with a discrete structural determinant of sspb that is not conserved in spap.

TI  == identification of a porphyromonas gingivalis receptor for the streptococcus gordonii sspb protein.
AB  == colonization of the plaque biofilm by the oral pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis  is favored by the presence of antecedent organisms such as streptococcus gordonii. coadhesion between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii can be mediated by the sspb protein of s. gordonii; however, the p. gingivalis cognate receptor for this protein has not been identified. in this study, we identified a surface protein of p. gingivalis that interacts with the sspb protein. coprecipitation between p. gingivalis outer membrane proteins and purified sspb protein demonstrated that a  100-kda p. gingivalis protein bound to sspb. the 100-kda protein also bound to an engineered strain of enterococcus faecalis that expresses the sspb protein on the cell surface. monospecific polyclonal antibodies to the 100-kda protein inhibited the binding between p. gingivalis and s. gordonii in a dose-dependent manner up to 86%. amino acid sequencing of the 100-kda protein showed homology to a protein previously identified as the p. gingivalis minor fimbria. the minor fimbrial protein may exist as a complex with a hemagglutinin-like protein since the genes  encoding these proteins are adjacent on the chromosome and are cotranscribed. thus, the p. gingivalis receptor for s. gordonii sspb is a 100-kda protein that structurally may be a minor fimbria-protein complex and functionally effectuates  coadhesion.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetq.
AB  == we tested 34 american type culture collection (atcc) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetq gene using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay and dna-dna hybridization. the identities of pcr products were confirmed by southern blot hybridization of whole-cell dna. eleven  of the atcc strains were positive for tetq, including five bacteroides spp., five prevotella spp. and a single isolate of mitsuokella multiacidus. twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical gram-negative isolates carried the tetq gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical gram-positive isolates carried the tetq gene. this is the first description of tetq in gram-positive species. all isolates except one peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetq integrated into the chromosome. the tetq  gene could be transferred from prevotella bivia, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides  fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides distasonis into an enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. in contrast, tetq failed to transfer from two isolates of prevotella intermedia, two isolates  of porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of peptostreptococcus sp. the latter two are gram-positive species. the pcr assay was used to screen 198 proteinase k-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the pcr assay could be of value in  screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.

TI  == periodontal microflora of hiv infected patients with periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the microbial profile of periodontal lesions in hiv seropositive patients and to compare it with rapidly progressing periodontal lesions in systemically healthy patients. the subgingival microflora  of 20 cdc ii, 20 cdc iii, 20 cdc iv/v and 20 systemically healthy patients with rapidly progressing periodontitis was examined. four sites with greatest probing  depth in each patient were selected for microbiological sampling. the samples were cultured aerobically and anaerobically for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. the microflora of periodontitis lesions within the three stages of the hiv infection was similar to that of progressing periodontitis in systemically healthy adults including campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, selenomonas spp. and peptostreptococcus micros. however, hiv seropositive periodontitis lesions harboured a range of exogenous pathogens rarely associated with common types of periodontitis including staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloaca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus avium, clostridium difficile, aspergillus fumigatus, klebsiella pneumoniae and mycoplasma incognitum. the lack of immune effector and regulatory cells in hiv infected patients could in fact explain the increase of some opportunistic pathogens and the characteristic and rapidly progressing nature of the periodontal disease in these patients.

TI  == molecules of streptococcus gordonii that bind to porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == interbacterial binding is considered an important colonization mechanism for many of the organisms that inhabit dental plaque. porphyromonas gingivalis, a periodontal pathogen, can adhere to species that comprise early plaque, such as streptococcus gordonii. in this study, the molecules of s. gordonii g9b that mediate binding to p. gingivalis were investigated. biotinylated surface molecules of s. gordonii were extracted and mixed with p. gingivalis cells. interactive streptococcal components were identified by sds-page of the p. gingivalis cells followed by electroblotting, and visualization of the adsorbed streptococcal molecules with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. s. gordonii molecules of 45 kda and a doublet of 62/60 kda were observed to bind to p. gingivalis. polyclonal antibodies raised to the 62/60 kda proteins inhibited the  binding interaction. these antibodies demonstrated an antigenic relationship between the 62/60 kda molecules and the 45 kda protein. both molecules were also  antigenically related to, and may be breakdown products of, a larger molecule of  170 kda which is antigenically related to the p1 antigen of s. mutans. cloning and expression in enterococcus faecalis of the gene for the p1-like molecule from s. gordonii m5 resulted in a phenotype that expressed the 62/60 kda and 45 kda antigens and was capable of binding to p. gingivalis. these results suggest that  a p1-like molecule in s. gordonii is involved in adherence to p. gingivalis. processing of the p1-like molecule into smaller fragments of 62/60 kda and 45 kda may be required for binding activity.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
