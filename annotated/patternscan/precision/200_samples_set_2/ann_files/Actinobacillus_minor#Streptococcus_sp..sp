TI  == defining the "core microbiome" of the microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == background: porcine tonsils are the colonization site for many pathogenic as well as commensal microorganisms and are the primary lymphoid tissue encountered by organisms entering through the mouth or nares. the goal of this study was to provide an in-depth characterization of the composition and structure of the tonsillar microbial communities and to define the core microbiome in the tonsils  of healthy pigs, using high throughput bar-coded 454-flx pyrosequencing. results: whole tonsils were collected at necropsy from 12 16-week-old finisher pigs from two healthy herds. tonsil brushes were also used to collect samples from four of  these animals. bacterial dna was isolated from each sample, amplified by pcr with universal primers specific for the bacterial 16s rrna genes, and the pcr products sequenced using pyrosequencing. an average of 13,000 sequences were generated from each sample. microbial community members were identified by sequence comparison to known bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences.the microbiomes of these healthy herds showed very strong similarities in the major components as well as  distinct differences in minor components. pasteurellaceae dominated the tonsillar microbiome in all animals, comprising ~60% of the total, although the relative proportions of the genera actinobacillus, haemophilus, and pasteurella varied between the herds. also found in all animals were the genera alkanindiges, peptostreptococcus, veillonella, streptococcus and fusobacterium, as well as enterobacteriaceae and neisseriaceae. treponema and chlamydia were unique to herd 1, while arcanobacterium was unique to herd 2.tonsil brushes yielded similar results to tissue specimens, although enterobacteriaceae and obligate anaerobes were more frequently found in tissue than in brush samples, and chlamydia, an obligately intracellular organism, was not found in brush specimens. conclusions: we have extended and supported our previous studies with 16s clone libraries, using 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing to describe the microbial communities in tonsils of healthy pigs. we have defined a core microbiome, dominated by pasteurellaceae, in tonsil specimens, and have also demonstrated the presence of  unique minor components of the tonsillar microbiome present in each herd. we have validated the use of non-invasive tonsil brushes, in comparison to tonsil tissue, which will facilitate future studies.

TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == production and properties of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from the swine pathogen streptococcus suis serotype 2.
AB  == streptococcus suis serotype 2 is a major pathogen found in the upper respiratory  tract of swine. in this study, isolates of this bacterial species were tested for the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (blis). of the 38 strains tested, four inhibited the growth of other s. suis isolates according to  a deferred-antagonism plate assay. interestingly, three of the strains were originally isolated from healthy carrier pigs and were considered nonvirulent. three isolates (94-623, 90-1330, and aah4) that produced blis in liquid broth were selected for further characterization. none of the inhibitory activities was related to the production of either organic acids or hydrogen peroxide. the blis  produced by these strains were heat stable and proteinase k, pronase, and elastase sensitive but were trypsin and chymotrypsin resistant. they were stable  at ph 2 and 12 and had molecular masses in the range of 14 to 30 kda. maximum production was observed during the mid-log phase. following a curing procedure with novobiocin, only 90-1330 lost the ability to produce blis, suggesting that the blis might be plasmid encoded. analysis of the inhibitory spectra revealed that the blis-producing strains also inhibited the growth of actinobacillus minor, actinobacillus porcinus, enterococcus durans, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae, streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus, and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis.  this study reports for the first time the ability of the swine pathogen s. suis serotype 2 to produce blis with the characteristics of classic bacteriocins. further studies are required to investigate the possibility of using bacteriocin-producing strains to prevent swine infections caused by virulent strains of s. suis serotype 2.

TI  == interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
AB  == ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease.  however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur  was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for  intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.

TI  == evaluation of a pcr for detection of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils.
AB  == a pcr for the detection of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was evaluated. all of  102 field, isolates of a, pleuropneumoniae reacted in the pcr by amplification of a 985 bp product. no pcr amplification product was observed when examining strains of a. ureae, a. capsulatus, a. hominis, a. equuli, a, rossii, a. suis, escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica. streptococcus suis, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis, haemophilus taxon minor group, haemophilus taxon d/e and haemophilus taxon f. amplification of a 985 bp product was, however, observed when testing strains of a. lignieresii. the lower  detection limit of the pcr test was 10(3) a. pleuropneumoniae cfu/pcr test tube and was not affected by addition of 10(6) e. coli cfu/pcr test tube. mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils of 101 pigs from 9 different herds were tested by culture and by pcr using four different bacteriological media. while 65% reacted  positive in the pcr only 23% were positive by culture, thereby suggesting a superior sensitivity of the pcr test to that of culture. the use of selective media, large inoculum and incubation for 48 h gave the highest number of positive pcr reactions from mixed bacterial cultures. tonsil cultures from 50 pigs from an a. pleuropneumoniae-negative herd did not react in the pcr. the results show that pcr on mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils may be a highly sensitive method for the detection of a. pleuropneumoniae in pig herds.

TI  == levels of salivary iga antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  == serum igg, iga and igm and salivary iga antibody levels reactive with extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, eubacterium  saburreum and streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. the participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. a pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. this indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. a subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary iga antibody levels reactive with s. mutans, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). when 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for p. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. high levels of salivary iga directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.
