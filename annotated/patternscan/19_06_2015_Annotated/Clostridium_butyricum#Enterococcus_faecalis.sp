TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus strains used in clinical practice as probiotics.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibilities of probiotic strains that are suggested to be effective for preventing antibiotics-associated diarrhea (aad). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 17 antibiotics against probiotic strains were tested by the agar plate  dilution method or broth microdilution method. in all, eight probiotic strains containing enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium spp., clostridium butyricum, and lactobacillus acidophilus were tested. although the mic range was wide, from  less than 0.0625 to more than 1,024 mug/ml, the mics of 11 beta-lactams were high for three of four enterococci, with a range of 32 to more than 1,024 mug/ml. in contrast, fluoroquinolones and vancomycin showed potent activities against all enterococci, of which mics were 0.25-8 mug/ml. two bifidobacterium strains and one lactobacillus strain showed low mics against many of the beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, and vancomycin, with mics of 8 mug/ml or less. fosfomycin showed generally mild activity against enterococci (mic, 8-32 mug/ml)  and anaerobic strains (mic, 32 to >1,024 mug/ml), respectively. the probiotics strains with high mic values may survive in the intestinal tract, even if the patient was concomitantly using the antibiotics in clinical practice. therefore,  our results suggest that adequate combinations of probiotics strains and antibiotics should be important for preventing aad. further study is needed to determine the efficacy of probiotics in clinical practice.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == longitudinal analyses of gut mucosal microbiotas in ulcerative colitis in relation to patient age and disease severity and duration.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the normal colonic microbiota are associated with the etiology of ulcerative colitis (uc). although several mucosal species have been implicated in the disease process, the organisms and mechanisms involved are unknown. the aim of this investigation was to characterize mucosal biofilm communities over time and to determine the relationship of these bacteria to patient age and disease severity and duration. multiple rectal biopsy specimens were taken from 33 patients with active uc over a period of 1 year. real-time pcr was used to quantify mucosal bacteria in uc patients compared to 18 noninflammatory bowel disease controls, and the relationship between indicators of disease severity and bacterial colonization was evaluated by linear regression analysis. significant differences were detected in bacterial populations on the uc mucosa and in the control group, which varied over the study period. high clinical activity indices (cai) and sigmoidoscopy scores (ss) were associated with enterobacteria, desulfovibrios, type e clostridium perfringens, and enterococcus faecalis, whereas the reverse was true for clostridium butyricum, ruminococcus albus, and eubacterium rectale. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium numbers were linked with low cai. only e. rectale and clostridium clostridioforme had a high age dependence. these findings demonstrated that longitudinal variations in mucosal bacterial populations occur in uc and that bacterial community structure is related to disease severity.

TI  == addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve efficacy in the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized-controlled trial.
AB  == background: spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (sbp) may occur despite antibiotic  prophylaxis. we investigated whether the addition of probiotics to norfloxacin enhances its efficacy in the prevention of sbp. methods: a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial was conducted among consecutive cirrhotic patients who had either recovered from sbp (secondary prophylaxis) or who were at a high risk for the development of sbp (low ascitic fluid protein or serum bilirubin >/= 2.5 mg/dl; primary prophylaxis). norfloxacin 400 mg/day with probiotics capsules  (enterococcus faecalis jpc 30 million, clostridium butyricum 2 million, bacillus  mesentericus jpc 1 million, bacillus coagulans 50 million spores) at a dose of two capsules three times daily (group 1) or norfloxacin with a placebo (group 2)  was given and the occurrence of sbp within a period of 6 months (primary endpoint) or side-effects of therapy and mortality (secondary endpoints) were recorded. results: from april 2005 through august 2007, 110 patients were randomized to group 1 (n=55) or group 2 (n=55) and 45 (82%) and 43 (78%) of them  completed the trial, respectively. the baseline characteristics were comparable.  on intention-to-treat analysis, the cumulative probability of treatment failures  was similar in both the groups [19/55 (34%) in group 1 vs. 20/55 (36%) in group 2, p=0.840]. the cumulative probability of mortality was also similar [13/45 (29%) in group 1 vs. 14/43 (32%) in group 2, p=0.834]. the frequency of side-effects was also comparable. in subgroup analyses, the frequencies of sbp and deaths were similar in the two groups in the subgroups of primary and secondary prophylaxes. the presence of encephalopathy and serum bilirubin of greater than 3.65 mg/dl were found to predict mortality independently. conclusion: the addition of probiotics to norfloxacin does not improve its efficacy in primary or secondary prophylaxis of sbp or in reducing the mortality  in cirrhotic patients with ascites.

TI  == probiotic bio-three induces th1 and anti-inflammatory effects in pbmc and dendritic cells.
AB  == aim: to investigate the immune response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) and dendritic cells (dcs) that were stimulated by probiotic preparations. methods: pbmcs were isolated, cultured, and stimulated with bio-three (a mixture  of bacillus mesentericus, clostridium butyricum and enterococcus faecalis; 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/ml for 24 h). cytokine production of (1) circulating pbmcs; (2) pbmcs stimulated by probiotic preparation; (3) monocyte-derived dcs; and (4)  dc and t cell co-culture was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. phenotypic analysis of circulating pbmcs was also investigated by flow cytometry. blood was obtained from individuals who consumed bio-three (10(9) cfu/d b. mesentericus, c. butyricum and e. faecalis) for 2 wk, or those who did not take probiotics orally. results: in culture supernatants, interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) and interleukin (il)-10 production increased, but il-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) production by pbmcs decreased after 1 and 2 wk of probiotic treatment. flow cytometry was also performed on day 14 and detected enhanced expression of cd11b, hla-dr, cd4, cd45ra, cd25, cd44 and cd69 in response to bio-three. furthermore, il-10 and il-12 were upregulated in supernatants of monocyte-derived dcs, and ifn-gamma and il-10 were enhanced in supernatants of cd4(+) t cells co-cultured with dcs. conclusion: bio-three appeared to stimulate the th1 immune response, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines (tnf-alpha) and upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokine (il-10). probiotics could be effective in activation of pbmcs and dcs.

TI  == probiotics have clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic efficacy in acute infectious diarrhea.
AB  == background: acute infectious diarrhea is a major cause of childhood morbidity and economic burden for families. we evaluate the clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic effects of probiotics in acute infectious diarrhea. methods: children (n = 304) aged 3 months to 6 years hospitalized for acute diarrhea were randomized to receive bio-three (a mixture of bacillus mesentericus, enterococcus faecalis, and clostridium butyricum) or placebo orally 3 times daily for 7 days.  fecal samples were homogenized for bacterial culture and blood cells were isolated for cell culture and cytokine analysis. this study is registered (nct00463190). results: the mean duration of diarrhea after start of therapy was  60.1 hours in the probiotics group versus 86.3 hours in the placebo group (p = 0.003). hospital stay was shorter in the probiotics group than in the placebo group (p = 0.009). counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus species were elevated in stool culture of the probiotics (bio-three) group. il-10 was increased in the serum and supernatants of cell culture in the probiotics group,  and tumor necrosis factor-alpha values were down-regulated. interferon- gamma and il-12 were mildly elevated in the probiotics group, compared with the placebo group. conclusions: this probiotics mixture reduced the severity of diarrhea and  length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea. in addition to restoring beneficial intestinal flora, probiotics may enhance host protective immunity such as down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines.

TI  == probiotics reduce infectious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy.
AB  == background/aims: postoperative morbidity is a significant problem associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy. the clinical value of probiotics in surgical patients remains unclear. this study investigated the effect of probiotics on surgical outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy. methodology: seventy patients with pancreaticobiliary diseases were randomly allocated to two groups before pancreaticoduodenectomy, one of which received probiotics perioperatively and the other served as controls. postoperative infectious complications were recorded. results: of the 70 patients, 64 completed the trial (30 receiving probiotics and  34 controls). the probiotics used in the study contained enterococcus faecalis t-110, clostridium butyricum to-a, and bacillus mesentericus to-a. the probiotics were first administered immediately after admission, 3 to 15 days before the operation, and then reintroduced on the second postoperative day. they were continued until hospital discharge. infectious complications occurred after pancreaticoduodenectomy in 25 patients (39%). the incidence of infectious complications in the probiotics group (23%, 7/30) was significantly lower than in controls (53%, 18/34) (p = 0.02). mortality amongst all patients was 1.6% (1 patient in the control group). conclusions: the use of perioperative probiotics reduced postoperative infectious complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy, making it a promising potential adjunct therapy for patients undergoing high-risk hepato, biliary, and pancreatic surgery.

TI  == [investigation for proper use of probiotics in nagasaki university hospital of medicine and dentistry].
AB  == antimicrobial agents sometimes cause the adverse effects of diarrhea and loose stool. antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria are used to prevent these adverse effects. the bacteria are not resistant to several antimicrobial agents,  although the bacterium preparations are sometimes prescribed the antimicrobial agents concomitantly. therefore this paper reports that the minimal inhibitory concentration of three new antimicrobial agents against antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria were determined using a microdilution method with cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth. furthermore, we investigated antimicrobial  agents that are prescribed concomitantly with antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacterium preparations or a clostridium butyricum preparation. the bacteria were  susceptible to the three new antimicrobial agents. approximately 50% of the bacterium preparations were prescribed alone, and 30% were prescribed concomitantly with antimicrobial agents that show antimicrobial activity against  the bacteria. consequently, we suggest that pharmacists need to confirm prescriptions and to provide more drug information on antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacterium preparations.

TI  == glucose but not polypeptone reduces the effect of probiotic preparations to stimulate carbohydrate breakdown and reduce net ammonia production by pig cecal bacteria in vitro.
AB  == probiotic preparations are used to prevent or treat diarrhea. probiotic preparations increase the in vitro breakdown of carbohydrates and decrease that of protein by mixed cecal bacteria in the absence of readily fermentable materials. diarrhea can increase the influx of readily digestible materials into  the large intestine. therefore, we compared production of organic acids and ammonia in batch cultures using pig cecal contents with or without probiotic preparations (clostridium butyricum, lactobacillus casei plus bifidobacterium breve, or l. casei plus enterococcus faecalis) and with or without readily fermentable substrates (glucose or polypeptone). effects of additional substrates appeared earlier than those of probiotic preparations. both probiotic preparations and glucose increased the production of most short-chain fatty acids and lactic acid but decreased those of ammonia and isovaleric acid. effects of probiotic preparations and glucose were not additive. effects of different preparations were alike. polypeptone increased the production of ammonia and isovaleric acid independent of probiotic preparations. effects of probiotics and  glucose may be to provide either energy or carbon to the microbial ecosystem. effects of glucose were probably mediated through their direct utilization by indigenous bacteria.

TI  == [evaluation of the bacterial flora in natural corn silage].
AB  == silage is the best method for forage conservation, keeping it in a fresh condition and with high nutrient content. in order to study the natural evolution of maize silage without additives during 50 days after sealed, ph, temperature changes, number and type of the indigenous bacteria were studied every 5 days. the initial ph decreased from 6.40 to 4.10 and temperature stabilized at 26 degrees c. the mesophilic aerobic bacteria were quickly reduced across time. enterococci were descended gradually. clostridia remained in a low quantity. the  microorganisms most frequently isolated were escherichia coli, clostridium butyricum, enterococcus faecalis and lactobacillus plantarum; this acid lactic bacteria was the principal cause of the abundant production of anaerobic fermentation of sugars in the forage reaching the ph which maintained the silage  in adequate conditions.

TI  == gene transfer to clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319.
AB  == although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process  of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. to remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for clostridium cellulolyticum atcc 35319. firstly, transfer of tn1545 has been obtained using an enterococcus faecalis donor. secondly, incp-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. the yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic c. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. a restriction endonuclease was detected  in crude extracts of c. cellulolyticum. this enzyme, named cce:i, is an isoschizomer of msp:i (hpa:ii). electro-transformation was employed to establish  plasmids containing the replication functions of pamss1 (en. faecalis), pim13 (bacillus subtilis), pcb102 (clostridium butyricum), pip404 (clostridium perfringens) and pwv01 (lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in c. cellulolyticum. transformants were only obtained if the dna was appropriately methylated on the external c of the sequence 5'-ccgg-3' using either bsu:fi methylase in vivo or msp:i methylase in vitro. plasmids based on the pamss1 and pim13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pcb102 replicon. selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg dna) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg dna). the methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.

TI  == [ecological treatment of bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis with bio-three].
AB  == ecological treatment of bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis with a bio-three was studied, and the following results were obtained. 1. a total of 16 women with bacterial vaginosis and vaginitis were treated with intravaginal application of 2 g of bio-three (e. faecalis t-110, c. butyricum to-a, b. mesentericus to-a, ph 6.9 +/- 0.3). the effect of the treatment was evaluated 3 days after administration by monitoring the vaginal discharge and bacteriological assessment. 2. the clinical improvement was evaluated and the decreases of vaginal discharge and vaginal redness were significant and vaginal ph was lowered significantly (5.29 +/- 0.24 vs. 4.31 +/- 0.37, p < 0.05). in the vaginal discharge 35 strains of bacteria were detected, but 3 days after administration,  16/30 strains of gram-positive bacteria, and 2 strains of gram-negative bacteria  disappeared. as for the overall bacteriological effects, 7/16 cases were eradicated, 1 case was partly eradicated, 6 cases were replaced. these findings indicated that the bio-three therapy was effective in both clinical and bacteriological responses.

TI  == [estimation of probiotics by infection model of infant rabbit with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7].
AB  == we examined the preventative effect against enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 (ehec) infection in rabbits on administration of probiotics contained in  streptococcus faecalis, clostridium butyricum and bacillus mesentericus. the probiotics were administered to 5 days old japanese white rabbits throughout the  experiment. inoculation of 10(6) colony forming units (cfus) of ehec per rabbit was tried 8 days after birth. three days after ehec inoculation, in the control group (not administered probiotics), diarrhea was observed in approximately 80% of the rabbits, on the other hand, in the group administered probiotics, rabbits  showed diarrhea in 15%. in necropsy, the number of ehec in the contents of the cecum and the number of attaching and effacing (ae) lesions were fewer in the probiotics group than in the control group. these results suggest that infant rabbits are useful as a colitis model for ehec, and the probiotics are effective  for the prevention of the growth of ehec in the intestine and for diarrhea.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.

TI  == conjugative plasmid transfer from escherichia coli to clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == the conjugation mechanism of incp plasmids may be employed to mobilize small non-conjugative plasmids from escherichia coli to a wide range of different organisms. this strategy has been adapted for use with the gram-positive anaerobe, clostridium acetobutylicum ncib 8052. several shuttle vectors containing replicons from pam beta 1 (enterococcus faecalis), pcb101 (clostridium butyricum) or pwv01 (streptococcus cremoris), together with the cis-acting orit region of rk2, have been constructed, and transferred to and established in this  organism. one of the vectors apparently contains a hot spot for insertion of is1. conjugative mobilization of plasmids from e. coli will provide a useful alternative to electroporation for effecting gene transfer to this industrially important anaerobe.
