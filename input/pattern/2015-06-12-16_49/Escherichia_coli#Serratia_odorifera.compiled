TI  - Pattern of pathogens from surgical wound infections in a Nigerian hospital and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In surgical patients, infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. A prospective study to find the pattern of microorganisms responsible for post operative wound infections and their antibiotic susceptibility profile was therefore conducted. SETTING AND METHODS: Surgical wards in Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility screening of organisms were done employing standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: Bacterial pathogens were isolated from all the specimens while the yeast Candida species (spp) was isolated from 12.4%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism isolated accounting for 23 (18.3%) of a total of 126 isolates. Other organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus spp 11.1% each; Escherichia coli 10.3%; Candida spp 8.7%; Coagulase negative staphylococci 8.7%; Pseudomonas spp 6.3%; Serratia odorifera 4.7%; Bacteroides 4.0%; Enterococcus spp 3.2%; the remaining isolates were other enterobacteria. Sensitivity of the bacterial isolates to antibiotics varied. In general, resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was above 98%, whilst more than 70% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, fusidic acid and tobramycin. CONCLUSIONS: The infections were polymicrobic and multidrug resistant. The quinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, should be used as frontline drugs in the management of surgical wound infections at the hospital.
TI  - Short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of Citrus sinensis.
AB  - Antibacterial effect of Citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcesnces, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter amnigenus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Serratia odorifera. Methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. In vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. It was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of E. coli and K. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of C. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of S. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). The potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. The order of antioxidant activity through ABTS.+ and DPPH free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. Phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. It was also found that Chloroform/Methanol (5:5) and Butanol/Ethanol/Water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. These findings reveal the potential use of C. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.
TI  - Fecal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in community setting in Casablanca.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The importance of community-acquired infections due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community in Casablanca, Morocco. METHODS: During 6 months (2013), 93 fecal samples were examined for ESBL-PE. Isolates expressing an ESBL phenotype were investigated for the presence of genes encoding beta-lactamases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance. Conjugation experiments were done to determine the mobility of ESBL genes. RESULTS: The prevalence of fecal carriage of ESBL-PE was 4.3% (4/93; 95% CI, 0.2-8.4). Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 2), Escherichia coli (n = 1), and Serratia odorifera (n = 1) were the ESBL-producing species. Four (66.7%) of these isolates were multidrug-resistant. The blaSHV-12 (n = 5) was the most frequent ESBL gene detected, followed by blaCTX-M-15 (n = 3).The non-ESBL gene detected was blaTEM-1 (n = 5). One isolate harbored the qnrB1 variant. RESULTS of conjugation experiments indicated that blaSHV-12 + blaTEM-1 + qnrB1 and blaCTX-M-15 + blaTEM-1 genes were co-transferred and that these genes were carried by a conjugative plasmid of high molecular weight (125 kb). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of the intestinal tract as a reservoir for ESBL-PE in the community in Morocco.
TI  - Bacterial pleuritis with thickened mesothelial hyperplasia in a young beagle dog.
AB  - A five-month-old male beagle dog suddenly became moribund. Bloody fluid accumulated in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and soft yellow flecks were floating in the thoracic fluid. The mediastinum and pericardium became dark reddish with villous thickening. Other parietal and pulmonary pleurae were rough, and the organs adhered to each other. Histologically, most mediastinal pleura formed papillary projections covered by a single layer of mesothelial cells. Many macrophages and neutrophils infiltrated the submesothelial connective tissue. At the mediastinum adjacent to the pericardium, cuboidal mesothelial cells proliferated solidly and formed a thick surface stratum. The flecks consisted of gram-negative filamentous or small bacillary (coccoid) bacteria. In the right posterior lobe of the lung, neutrophilic infiltration and a large encapsulated abscess including a bacterial colony were present. We diagnosed this case as "bacterial pleuritis with thickened mesothelial hyperplasia". The cause of the pleuritis might be a chronic pleural infection spread via the lung abscess.
TI  - Transferable integrons of Gram-negative bacteria isolated from the gut of a wild  boar in the buffer zone of a national park.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the presence of integron-bearing Gram-negative bacteria in the gut of a wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) shot in the buffer zone of a national park. Five Gram-negative strains of Escherichia coli, Serratia odorifera, Hafnia alvei and Pseudomonas sp. were isolated. Four of these strains had class 2 integrase (intI2), and one harbored class 1 integrase (intI1). The integron-positive strains were multiresistant, i.e., resistant to at least three unrelated antibiotics. All of the integrons were transferred to E. coli J-53 (Rif(R)) in a conjugation assay. The results showed that a number of multiresistant, integron-containing bacterial strains of different genera may inhabit a single individual of a wild animal, allowing the possibility of transfer of antimicrobial resistance genes.
TI  - Phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon: public health implications.
AB  - Increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. Unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. Microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. Fish is a major source of protein in Cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. In this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of fish from the Limbe and Tiko beaches in South West Cameroon from May to October 2007. We isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. Data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. Eleven bacterial species were identified, including Escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), Citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), Proteus vulgaris (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), Klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), Klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), Serratia marcescens (4.8%), Serratia odorifera (4.8%), Hafnia alvei (4.4%) and Proteus penneri (2.9%). More contaminated fish were found at Limbe beach than at Tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). When ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). Ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. Almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. The results of our study demonstrate that fish from the coastal waters of South West Cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.
TI  - Monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of Sao Jorge, a Protected Denomination of Origin Portuguese semihard cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae and Micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. Standard plate counts (log CFU per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. Viable counts of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. Species identified within this family encompassed Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sakazakii, and Escherichia coli; Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Klebsiella terrigena, and Serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. No Salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. Viable counts of Micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. Species identified within this family encompassed Staphylococcus sciuri, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and Staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). Accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and pH. Statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of Enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of Micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and moisture content than between viable numbers and pH. The results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the indicators total mesophile and Enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100- and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. However, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4 months of ripening), Sao Jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus, as well as absence of Salmonella.
TI  - Characterization of the Enterobacteriaceae isolated from an artisanal Italian ewe's cheese (Pecorino Abruzzese).
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate some physiological characteristics of the Enterobacteriaceae isolated from Pecorino cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: The production of organic acids, secondary volatile compounds, biogenic amines (BA) and the lipolytic and proteolytic activities of Citrobacter braakii, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Kluyvera spp., Salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae and Serratia odorifera strains were determined in skim milk after 48 h of fermentation at 30 degrees C. The proteolytic activity observed only in Ser. odorifera and Kluyvera spp. was confirmed by the peptide profiles of the pH 4.6-insoluble fraction using RP-HPLC; however, the lipase activity was evidenced in all the isolates of E. coli, Kluyvera spp. and Salm. enterica ssp. arizonae. During fermentation, all the strains utilized citric acid and produced significant quantities of putrescine followed by histamine, spermine and spermidine as well as acetic and lactic acid. Moreover, the major volatile compounds produced were ethanol, 2,3-butanedione, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-heptanone and acetone. CONCLUSIONS: The Enterobacteriaceae of dairy origin possess many metabolic activities that could affect the sensory quality of the cheese in which they grow during ripening. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The important physiological characteristics possessed by Enterobacteriaceae confirm the complexity of the microbiota of Pecorino Abruzzese cheese, which influences the typical sensory properties of this product.
TI  - An analysis of human pathogens found in horse/mule manure along the John Muir Trail in Kings Canyon and Sequoia and Yosemite National Parks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of microorganisms that are potentially pathogenic for humans in horse/mule manure along the John Muir Trail (JMT). METHODS: Random samples of horse/mule manure were collected along sections of the JMT in Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia national parks (NP), as well as in portions of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and selected JMT/PCT access trails. Convenience samples of wild animal scat found within I mile of trails were also collected. The fresh specimens were individually preserved both in 0.9% saline and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-containing tubes and stored at 4 degrees C until time of analysis. Bacteriological analysis was performed using standard microbiology laboratory procedures. PVA samples were stained with trichrome and were then examined by a parasitologist. RESULTS: Collection: A total of 186 trail miles were sampled, including 113 on the JMT (Yosemite 37, Kings 53, and Sequoia 23). The PCT samplings included 24 miles, and NP and wilderness area access trails added an additional 49 miles. A total of 102 samples were collected, which included 81 samples from pack animals and 21 identified as having come from wild animals. Pack Animal Bacteria: All plated specimens grew large numbers of commensal gut flora. Potential pathogenic bacteria were found in only 12 samples and included Hafnia alvei (4), Serratia odorifera (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Escherichia vulneris (1), Clostridium clostridioforme (1), Yersinia enterocolitica (1), Sherwinella putraformus (1), and Enterobacter spp (4). No Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella, or Aeromonas were found. Microscopic examination for protozoal organisms revealed occasional commensal ciliates and I Giardia. Wild Animal Pathogens: One specimen grew Y enterocolitica, and another grew Enterobacter amnigenus. CONCLUSIONS: We found a low prevalence of human pathogens in pack animal manure on the JMT.
TI  - Bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of IV catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: 100 dogs. PROCEDURE: Catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. The distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) solution. The saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. All bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. RESULTS: Bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. Most bacteria that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (Serratia odorifera, S. liquefaciens, S. marcescens, Acinobacter anitratus, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp). Only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (Staphylococcus intermedius and Streptococcus spp). High percentages of organisms were resistant to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. Percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that IV catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.
TI  - [Escherichia coli: diversity of biochemical phenotypes in aquatic environments (Santa, Fe, Argentina)].
AB  - During certain environmental conditions, the floating aquatic vegetation, mainly  represented by Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) invade and even cover water courses assigned to recreational activities or to the supply of drinkable water. The rhizosphere of these plants constitutes an unknown biotope of bacteria of sanitary interest, possibly different from waters without vegetation and of the sediment of the same aquatic system. To verify such possibility, 206 isolated strains in MacConkey Agar (Difco) were typified and identified (78 from water, 65 from sediment and 63 from rhizosphere) using the API 20 E system (v. 4.0) and Apilab plus software (v 3.3.3), both of bioMerieux (Marcy-l'Etoile, France, 1998). Nineteen different biochemical phenotypes from E. coli were found. The 79% of the population belonged to only 7 phenotypes; the 21% remaining, to the other 12 phenotypes. Twelve phenotypes did not share the biotopes, while only 4 were in the three. These results (and those obtained by other authors who used the API 20 E system in other biotopes) suggest that it would be possible to characterize the rhizosphere using those phenotypes that are found in smaller proportion. The greatest index of diversity (H) and evenness (E) were found in the rhizosphere (H = 2.903; E = 0.874). The dendrogram (average distances and UPGMA method) reaffirms the dissimilarity in biochemical phenotypes of E. coli populations of the rhizosphere with regard to the other biotopes. The most abundant bacterial species in the three biotopes were E. coli, Klebsiella terrigena and K. pneumoniae, corresponding to 75.2% of the community. The rhizosphere differed from Serratia odorifera and from Klebsiella spp. because of its higher rate of isolation.
TI  - [Interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "Enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  - Gamma-Glutamyltransferase (gammaGT) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-L-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. The following species produced gamma GT: Citrobacter freundii, Levinea malonatica, L. amalonatica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, K. ozaenae, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, E. agglomerans, E. gergoviae, Hafnia alvei, Erwinia carotovora, Serratia marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. plymuthica, S. marinorubra, S. odorifera, S. ficaria, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, P. morganii, P. rettgeri, Providencia alcalifaciens, P. stuartii, Yersinia enterocolitica and Y. pseudotuberculosis. Most strains of Escherichia coli and Alkalescens Dispar group are gamma GT+. The following species did not produce gammaGT: Shigella sonnei, Edwardsiella tarda, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and Yersinia pestis. Within the Salmonella, most strains of subgenus I, II and IV, and diphasic strains of subgenus III (S. arizonae) produced gamma GT, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus III did not produce gammaGT. Salmonella enteritidis (gammaGT+) and S. dublin (gammaGT-) can readily be distinguished. This test (gammaGT) could also serve as a biochemical marker for S. typhi-murium strains. Shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammaGT+ whereas other serotypes were gammaGT-. Within S. flexneri serotype 6, varieties Boyd 88 and Newcastle were found gammaGT+; and varieties Sussex and Manchester were gammaGT-. The use of gammaGT test as an epidemiological marker for other Shigella serotypes is suggested.
