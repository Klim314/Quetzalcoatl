TI  == microbiological evaluation of bacterial and mycotic seal in implant systems with  different implant-abutment interfaces and closing torque values.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible leakage of 3 species of bacteria (streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces odontolyticus) and of candida albicans and candida glabrata in osseointegrated implants with different implant-abutment interface (iai) geometry. materials and methods: two groups of implants, (1) implant-abutment unit with a tube-in-tube interface and (2) implant-abutment unit with a flat-to-flat interface closed with different torque values, were compared in the  study. in the first phase, the implants were assembled and cultured in vitro for  7 days. the implants and abutments were disconnected and samples were taken and cultured. in the second phase, the internal part of each implant was inoculated with 0.1 microl of microbial broth and then connected to the respective abutments. afterward, medium samples were taken and cultured. results: the group  1 implants were more resistant to colonization than those of group 2 (p < 0.05).  the intragroup difference was significant between the implant-abutment units assembled with the recommended torque values and those with lower torque values (p < 0.01) for both the groups. conclusion: iai geometry influences both bacterial and yeast colonization inside the implants as well as the torque value  used to connect abutments to implants.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == the effects of chlorhexidine gluconate (0.12%) on the antimicrobial properties of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate.
AB  == the purpose of this in vitro study was to determine whether the substitution of 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for sterile water as a mixing agent would enhance the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mineral trioxide aggregate (mta) against actinomyces odontolyticus (atcc17982), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc2586), streptococcus sanguis (atcc10556), enterococcus faecalis (er3/2s), escherichia coli (sm10lambdapir), staphylococcus aureus (atcc6538), pseudomonas aeruginosa (ume), and candida albicans (atcc10261). two wells of 5-mm diameter were made in triplicate agar plates inoculated with standardized suspensions of each microorganism. mta (33 mg) mixed with chlorhexidine (12 microl) or sterile water (12 microl) was placed to fill each well. plates were incubated at 37 degrees c as required for microbial growth. a blinded, independent observer measured zones of inhibition. all mta samples inhibited microbial growth regardless of mixing agent. mta/chlorhexidine showed significantly larger zones of inhibition (p < 0.0002, paired t test). in conclusion, substituting 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate for water enhanced the antimicrobial activity of tooth-colored proroot mta.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of 'mgp' gutta-percha in vitro.
AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == oral microbiota and implant type membranes.
AB  == candida albicans (ca), staphylococcus aureus (sa), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces naeslundii (an), actinomyces odontolyticus (ao), porphyromona spp (p  spp), candida glabrata (cg), candida krusei (ck), and rhodotorula spp (r spp) were tested with equal pieces of biodegradable membranes. membranes pretreated with saliva or clorhexidine and nontreated control membranes were tested in three different culture media containing 0.1 ml homologous suspension for each strain under study. incubation was performed at 37 degrees c for 48 hours for aerobiosis and for five days for anaerobiosis. macroscopy and microscopy were carried out. membranes were removed, washed, and resuspended. samples were sonicated, and the  supernatant was disseminated on brain heart infusion broth or blood agar. incubation was repeated, colony-forming unit counts were performed, and statistical analysis was carried out using analysis of variance transforming results to log10 (x + 1), the highest interaction level was used to calculate standard error. orthogonal contrast was used to compare the different microorganisms under study. highest adhesion was found with ca, cg, ck, sa, and ss. a sufficient quantity of actinomyces could not be recovered from the membranes. results with p spp were poor, confirming lower gram-negative adhesion. replicate flasks with ss and ca were cultivated. membranes were removed after washing and subjected to scanning electron microscopy, as were untreated control  pieces. a cavelike surface was observed. streptococcus sanguis adhering to the membranes showed extracellular projections. candida and gram-positive cocci showed great recovery capacity.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == the endodontic microflora revisited.
AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == the microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  == thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. the teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus species, and veillonella. after plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the royal dental college (copenhagen) for histological analysis. the results showed that s. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. s. sanguis and 's. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and veillonella was isolated from all samples. a.  viscosus was the most commonly isolated actinomyces. the numbers of streptococcus and veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). s. mutans and a. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at  day 1 (p less than 0.01). histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. dissolution was detected in areas where s. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but s. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). there was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of s. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of s. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  == the difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. this investigation assessed the antibacterial  and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. the microorganisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary  organisms, and candida albicans. the results showed an absence of activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. it is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.

TI  == effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  == in this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. the patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. the bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. odontolyticus and  s. mutans and significantly lower proportions of b. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. the spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (ap) patients,  averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. the bacteriological results could not distinguish between ada type iii and iv periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any ap patient. the patients designated as early onset periodontitis (eop) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of bacteroides gingivalis and/or b. intermedius. two types of eop were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. four localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients were notable in not having detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of ljp are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == inhibition of [3h]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the streptococcus and actinomyces species.
AB  == extracts from human dental plaque, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelli and actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3h]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of hela cells. the results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
