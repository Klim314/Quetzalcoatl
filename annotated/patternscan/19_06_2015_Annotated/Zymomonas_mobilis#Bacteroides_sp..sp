TI  == sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid from flavobacterium sp. kp1, a psychrophilic bacterium.
AB  == a cryptic plasmid found at high copy number was isolated from flavobacterium sp.  kp1, a psychrophilic gram-negative bacterium, cloned, and sequenced. the sequence will appear in the ddbj/embl/genbank databases under the accession number ab007196. the pfl1 plasmid is 2311 nucleotides in length with 32.7% gc content, and shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other plasmids of similar length. the plasmid contains two open reading frames of significant length, orfi and orfii. orfi encodes a protein similar to the replication proteins found in gram-negative bacterial plasmids, bacteroides fragilis plasmid  pbi143 and zymomonas mobilis plasmid pzm2. the putative translation product of orfii shows homologies with plasmid recombination proteins found mainly in gram-positive bacterial plasmids such as staphylococcus aureus plasmid pt181.
