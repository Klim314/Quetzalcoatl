TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == phenotypic and molecular methods used for identification of oral streptococci and related microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains the greatest biodiversity, over 70 species being isolated from mouth mucosa, saliva, denture surfaces and/or dental-plaque. the oral streptococci, representing over 80% of the mouth micro flora, are able to synthesize glucosyl-transferases, enzymes involved in glucans production. glucans are involved in production of an extracellular slime layer promoting adhesion and formation of a dental plaque biofilm. the 43 isolates studied obtained from partially and/or totally edentulous, were identified by vitek system using gram-positive identification cards. species-specific regions within the genes coding for glucosyl-transferases (gtf genes) were targeted for pcr identification of isolates. sequencing of 16s rrna was used as gold standard for strain confirmation. vitek system identified a number of 11 strains as s. mitis/oralis,  12 strains as s. anginosus/gordonii, 12 strains as s. sanguinis/parasanguinis, 3  strains as s. salivarius, 3 strains as s. plurianimalium, 1 strain as s. cristatus and 1 strain as s. alactolyticus, respectively. the pcr system targeting gtf genes was able to identify s. oralis, s. salivarius and s. gordonii strains. sequence of 16s rrna discriminated among streptococci species and revealed 16 strains of leuconostoc mesenteroides. many studies are needed in order to select the most reliable phenotypic and genotypic methods in order to improve the identification algorithm for oral streptococci used by clinical laboratories. their accurate identification is mandatory for better understanding their role in human infections.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from aoc salers cheese.
AB  == the objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. the characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: rep-pcr, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16s rdna for strain typing and taxonomic identification. the strains  belonged to lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garviae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus millieri, streptococcus macedonicus and pediococcus pentosaceus. a  wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. the natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined  to identify and characterize natural microflora. this study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the facultatively heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and sb medium selective for enterococcus. the study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of salers cheese and its diversity. a better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria from prepacked meat and meat products.
AB  == ninety-four strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from refrigerated, prepacked meat and meat products were together with 59 reference strains of brochothrix, lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and streptococcus phenotypically classified, using 96 unit characters. data were examined using simple matching (ssm) or jaccard coefficient (sj), and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. twenty-three clusters with two or more members were defined  at the 84% ssm-similarity level which corresponded to the sj-similarity level of  61%. based on ssm, most field strains were included in nine clusters, and with three unsignificant exceptions these contained no reference strains. the field clusters were designated carnobacterium piscicola (cluster 1; 5% of field isolates), carnobacterium divergens (cluster 2; 9% of field isolates), leuconostoc (cluster 9; 18% of field isolates) and lactobacillus (cluster 4, 10,  11, 12, 13 and 14; together 60% of field isolates). the lactobacillus clusters had many features in common with cluster ii of shaw & harding (1984). phenotypical characteristics of major clusters are given. the ssm and sj based classifications basically coincided for the field strains; the exception was cluster 4 which now were split in two parts. fourteen clusters were made up of mainly reference strains (ssm). most of them included more than one type strain on species level; exceptions were brochothrix thermosphacta (cluster 3), lactobacillus salivarius (cluster 17) and leuconostoc mesenteroides (cluster 18). several rearrangements were seen amongst the clusters of the reference strains when sj, instead of ssm, was used for clustering.
