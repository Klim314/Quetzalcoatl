TI  - Essential Oil from Berries of Lebanese Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb Displays Similar Antibacterial Activity to Chlorhexidine but Higher Cytocompatibility with Human Oral Primary Cells.
AB  - Chlorhexidine (CHX), one of the most effective drugs administered for periodontal treatment, presents collateral effects including toxicity when used for prolonged periods; here, we have evaluated the bactericidal potency and the cytocompatibility of Juniperus excelsa M. Bieb essential oil (EO) in comparison with 0.05% CHX. The EO was extracted from berries by hydrodistillation and components identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Bacterial inhibition halo analysis, quantitative cell viability 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulphophenyl)-5-[(phenyl amino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide assay (XTT), and colony forming unit (CFU) count were evaluated against the two biofilm formers Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, cytocompatibility was assessed with human primary gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and mucosal keratinocytes (HK). The resulting EO was mainly composed of monoterpene hydrocarbons and oxygenated monoterpenes. An inhibition halo test demonstrated that both bacteria were sensitive to the EO; XTT analysis and CFU counts confirmed that 10-fold-diluted EO determined a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in bacteria count and viability towards both biofilm and planktonic forms in a comparable manner to those obtained with CHX. Moreover, EO displayed higher cytocompatibility than CHX (p < 0.05). In conclusion, EO exhibited bactericidal activity similar to CHX, but a superior cytocompatibility, making it a promising antiseptic alternative to CHX.
TI  - Interleukin-6 and microRNA profiles induced by oral bacteria in human atheroma derived and healthy smooth muscle cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease with possible contributions from bacterial antigens. We aimed to investigate the role of oral bacteria as inducers of inflammatory cascades in smooth muscle cells from carotid endarterectomy patients (AthSMCs) and healthy controls (HSMCs). FINDINGS: Inactivated Streptococcus mitis, S. sanguinis, S. gorgonii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were used to stimulate inflammation in HSMCs and AthSMCs. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) was used as a positive control in all stimulations. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were determined from cell culture supernatants and microRNA expression profiles from cells after 24 h of bacterial stimulation. Genome wide expression (GWE) analyses were performed after 5 h stimulation. All studied bacteria induced pro inflammatory IL-6 production in both SMCs. The most powerful inducer of IL-6 was A. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.001). Of the 84 studied miRNAs, expression of 9 miRNAs differed significantly (p </= 0.001) between HSMCs and AthSMCs stimulated with inactivated bacteria or TNFalpha. The data was divided into two groups: high IL-6 producers (A. actinomytectemcomititans and TNFalpha) and low IL-6 producers (streptococcal strains and P. gingivalis). The expression of 4 miRNAs (miR-181-5p, -186-5p, -28-5p and -155-5p) differed statistically significantly (p < 0.001) between healthy HSMCs and AthSMCs in the low IL-6 producer group. According to multidimensional scaling, two gene expression clusters were seen: one in HSMCs and one AthSMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that inactivated oral bacteria induce inflammation that is differently regulated in healthy and atherosclerotic SMCs.
TI  - Synthesis of new carolacton derivatives and their activity against biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  - Carolacton, a secondary metabolite isolated from the extracts of Sorangium cellulosum, causes membrane damage and cell death in biofilms of the caries- and endocarditis-associated bacterium Streptococcus mutans. Here, we report the total synthesis of several derivatives of carolacton. All new structural modifications introduced abolished its biological activity, including subtle ones, such as inversion of configuration at C9. However, a bicyclic bislactone derivative as well as the methyl ester of carolacton resulted in compounds with prodrug properties. Their inhibitory activity on S. mutans was proven to be based on enzymatic hydrolysis by S. mutans which provided native carolacton resulting in biofilm damage in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that carolacton acts also on S. gordonii, S. oralis and the periodontitis pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, causing elongated cells and growth inhibition.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Chemokine CXCL10 for Dermal and Oral Microorganisms.
AB  - CXCL10 (IP-10) is a small 10 kDa chemokine with antimicrobial activity. It is induced by IFN-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of T cells. Recently, we detected CXCL10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. In the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that CXCL10 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium jeikeium, Corynebacterium striatum, and Candida albicans HMV4C, but not Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Poryphromonas gingivalis, or C. albicans ATCC 64124. The reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. However, antimicrobial activity of CXCL10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues, 7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pI of 9.93. Modeling studies revealed that CXCL10 contains an alpha-helix at the N-terminal, three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the C-terminal. Thus, CXCL10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.
TI  - Periodontal Therapy Effects on Nitrite Related to Oral Bacteria: A 6-Month Randomized Clinical Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. Through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. This 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. METHODS: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-QS) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-FMS) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (CHX) (QS+CHX and FMS+CHX), placebo (QS+Placebo and FMS+Placebo), or no mouth rinse (QS+none and FMS+none) use. Real-time PCR determined total bacterial, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus oralis, and Actinomyces naeslundi levels. Salivary nitrite concentration was determined with Griess reagent. Data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by ANOVA (Analysis of Variance), Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, and Spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). RESULTS: Nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. Regarding CHX use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (FMS+CHX) and one positive correlation between P.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (QS+CHX). Independently of rinse type, in the FMS group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. CONCLUSIONS: The relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. Short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term CHX use.
TI  - Intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  - Brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. This phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. We compiled a total of 60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. A systematic review of the literature using the PubMed database was performed. Men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. Caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. In 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. Commonly implicated microorganisms included Streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group), Actinomyces, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Eikenella corrodens. There was an 8.3% mortality rate. Intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. This suggests that hematogenous spread is the most likely route of dissemination.
TI  - Quantitative proteomics reveal distinct protein regulations caused by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans within subgingival biofilms.
AB  - Periodontitis is an infectious disease that causes the inflammatory destruction of the tooth-supporting (periodontal) tissues, caused by polymicrobial biofilm communities growing on the tooth surface. Aggressive periodontitis is strongly associated with the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in the subgingival biofilms. Nevertheless, whether and how A. actinomycetemcomitans orchestrates molecular changes within the biofilm is unclear. The aim of this work was to decipher the interactions between A. actinomycetemcomitans and other bacterial species in a multi-species biofilm using proteomic analysis. An in vitro 10-species "subgingival" biofilm model, or its derivative that included additionally A. actinomycetemcomitans, were anaerobically cultivated on hydroxyapatite discs for 64 h. When present, A. actinomycetemcomitans formed dense intra-species clumps within the biofilm mass, and did not affect the numbers of the other species in the biofilm. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteomic content of the biofilm lysate. A total of 3225 and 3352 proteins were identified in the biofilm, in presence or absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, respectively. Label-free quantitative proteomics revealed that 483 out of the 728 quantified bacterial proteins (excluding those of A. actinomycetemcomitans) were accordingly regulated. Interestingly, all quantified proteins from Prevotella intermedia were up-regulated, and most quantified proteins from Campylobacter rectus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were down-regulated in presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Enrichment of Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed that the regulated groups of proteins were responsible primarily for changes in the metabolic rate, the ferric iron-binding, and the 5S RNA binding capacities, on the universal biofilm level. While the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans did not affect the numeric composition or absolute protein numbers of the other biofilm species, it caused qualitative changes in their overall protein expression profile. These molecular shifts within the biofilm warrant further investigation on their potential impact on its virulence properties, and association with periodontal pathogenesis.
TI  - Anaerobic culture to detect periodontal and caries pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anaerobic culture has been critical in our understanding of the oral  microbiotas. HIGHLIGHT: Studies in advanced periodontitis in the 1970's revealed microbial complexes that associated with different clinical presentations. Taxonomy studies identified species newly-observed in periodontitis as Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter (Wolinella) rectus and other Campylobacter species, and Tannerella (Bacteroides) forsythia. Anaerobic culture of initial periodontitis showed overlap in the microbiota with gingivitis, and added Selenomonas noxia and Filifactor alocis as putative periodontal pathogens. Porphyromonas gingivalis and T. forsythia were found to be associated with initial periodontitis in adults. The dominant microbiota of dental caries differs from that of periodontitis. The major cariogenic species are acidogenic and acid tolerant species particularly Streptococcus mutans, and Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. Anaerobic culture of severe early childhood caries revealed a widely diverse microbiota, comparable to that observed using cloning and sequencing. The PCR-based cloning approach, however, underestimated Actinobacteria compared with culture. Only a subset of the caries-associated microbiota was acid tolerant, with different segments of the microbiota cultured on blood agar compared to a low pH acid agar. While the major caries-associated species was S. mutans, a new species, Scardovia wiggsiae, was significantly associated with early childhood caries. Higher counts of S. wiggsiae were also observed in initial white spot carious lesions in adolescents. CONCLUSION: In periodontitis and dental caries, anaerobic culture studies of advanced disease provided a comprehensive analysis of the microbiota of these infections. Anaerobic culture highlighted the limitation of PCR with standard primers that underestimate detection of Actinobacteria.
TI  - Bactericidal Activity and Mechanism of Photoirradiated Polyphenols against Gram-Positive and -Negative Bacteria.
AB  - The bactericidal effect of various types of photoirradiated polyphenols against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was evaluated in relation to the mode of action. Gram-positive bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus mutans) and Gram-negative bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) suspended in a 1 mg/mL polyphenol aqueous solution (caffeic acid, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and proanthocyanidin) were exposed to LED light (wavelength, 400 nm; irradiance, 260 mW/cm2) for 5 or 10 min. Caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid exerted the highest bactericidal activity followed by gallic acid and proanthocyanidin against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It was also demonstrated that the disinfection treatment induced oxidative damage of bacterial DNA, which suggests that polyphenols are incorporated into bacterial cells. The present study suggests that blue light irradiation of polyphenols could be a novel disinfection treatment.
TI  - Selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  - Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (Poly)phenols (PPs), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. The objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of selected PPs on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. Selected PPs (n = 48) were screened against Streptococcus mitis (S. mitis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. actinomycetemcomitans), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). The antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (PMIC) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (PMBC) using standardized broth microdilution assays. The most active PPs were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. Of the 48 PPs tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (PMIC range = 7.8-62.5 mug mL(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (PMIC range = 2.4-2500 mug mL(-1)), pyrocatechol (MIC range = 4.9-312.5 mug mL(-1)) and quercetin (PMIC range = 31.2-500 mug mL(-1)). At this concentration, adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of S. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. While both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. Overall, PPs possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. Further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (PT) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in patients with chronic periodontitis. METHODS: The study was conducted from December 2013 to May 2014 at Ewha Womans University Mokdong Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups in a 1:1 ratio: SRP+PT and SRP (control) groups. All participants underwent full-mouth SRP. PT was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. Plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. RESULTS: The clinical parameters improved in both the groups. At the follow-up assessment, PPD was significantly decreased in the SRP+PT group (P=0.00). Further, PPD and CAL showed significantly greater changes in the SRP+PT group than in the SRP group (PPD, P=0.03; CAL, P=0.04). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive PT seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial effects is not sufficient. Long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective PT protocol and compare the effectiveness of PT with and without exogenous photosensitizers.
TI  - Integration of non-oral bacteria into in vitro oral biofilms.
AB  - Biofilms are polymicrobial communities that grow on surfaces in nature. Oral bacteria can spontaneously form biofilms on the surface of teeth, which may compromise the health of the teeth, or their surrounding (periodontal) tissues. While the oral bacteria exhibit high tropism for their specialized ecological niche, it is not clear if bacteria that are not part of the normal oral microbiota can efficiently colonize and grow within oral biofilms. By using an in vitro "supragingival" biofilm model of 6 oral species, this study aimed to investigate if 3 individual bacterial species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota (Eschericia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecails) and one not previously tested oral species (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) can be incorporated into this established supragingival biofilm model. Staphylococcus aureus and A. actinomycetemcomitans were able to grow efficiently in the biofilm, without disrupting the growth of the remaining species. They localized in sparse small aggregates within the biofilm mass. Enterococcus faecalis and E. coli were both able to populate the biofilm at high numbers, and suppressed the growth of A. oris and S. mutants. Enterococcus faecalis was arranged in a chain-like conformation, whereas E. coli was densely and evenly spread throughout the biofilm mass. In conclusion, it is possible for selected species that are not part of the normal oral microbiota to be introduced into an oral biofilm, under the given experimental micro-environmental conditions. Moreover, the equilibrated incorporation of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. aureus in this oral biofilm model could be a useful tool in the study of aggressive periodontitis and peri-implantitis, in which these organisms are involved, respectively.
TI  - Regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: In periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (AM) and nitric oxide (NO). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Regulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Veillonella atypica, Streptococcus salivarius and Candida albicans was examined. AM and NO were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (NO metabolites) Griess assay respectively. Cellular production of AM and inducible NO synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. The inter-relationship of AM and NO production were further investigated with macrophages. RESULTS: A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus induced maximal levels of both AM and NO after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral keratinocytes. AM production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible NO synthase inhibitor, Nomega -Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. Likewise, NO production was increased upon exposure to AM, while the AM receptor antagonist AM 22-52 reduced the release of NO. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, P. gingivalis and Prev. intermedia, and commensals, S. salivarius and V. atypica, as regards the upregulation of AM and NO production from oral keratinocytes. Interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. Understanding the coordinated regulation of AM and NO production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.
TI  - Oral bacterial DNA findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial DNA can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. Some case reports describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with PCR; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial PCR has not been used as a diagnostic method before. OBJECTIVE: To find out whether bacterial DNA can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. METHODS: Twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at Tampere University Hospital during 2009-2010. Of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (CAD), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe CAD. Bacterial DNA amounts were determined using real-time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (Streptococcus mitis group, Streptococcus anginosus group, Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus epidermidis, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium nucleatus, and Dialister pneumosintes). RESULTS: Of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. Only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. There was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial DNA in the pericardial fluid and the severity of CAD (p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: Oral bacterial DNA was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of CAD and the total amount of bacterial DNA in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.
TI  - Low levels of caries in aggressive periodontitis: A literature review.
AB  - This article is a traditional literature review on caries levels in aggressive periodontitis. Aggressive periodontitis generally affects systemically healthy individuals aged <30 years (older individuals can also be affected) and is characterized by a young age of onset, rapid rate of disease progression, and familial aggregation of cases. Dental caries is caused by the dissolution of enamel by acid-producing bacteria present in the plaque biofilm, especially when the biofilm reaches critical mass due to improper oral hygiene. The association between caries level and aggressive periodontitis has long been debated. Initial research indicated that caries levels were high in patients with aggressive periodontitis, but high-quality studies have consistently shown that caries and aggressive periodontitis are inversely related. A recent in vitro study showed that Streptococcus mutans was killed more readily in the saliva of patients with aggressive periodontitis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans positivity than in patients with A. actinomycetemcomitans negativity. Other mechanisms possibly explaining the inverse relationship between caries and aggressive periodontitis in cases of Down's syndrome are also discussed in this literature review. The usefulness of caries level in the diagnosis of aggressive periodontitis in developing countries such as India, where the disease is diagnosed primarily on the basis of clinical and radiographic features and familial history is also discussed.
TI  - In vitro Evaluation of Antibacterial Efficacy of Pineapple Extract (Bromelain) on Periodontal Pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis is an inflammatory disease resulting in the destruction of periodontal tissues. Various treatment modalities have been tried in the form of mechanical therapy and surgical therapy. Antimicrobial agents have been used as a monotherapy and as an adjunct with mechanical debridement. Various plant extracts have been used as antibacterial agents. Pineapple extract (bromelian) is one such agent. Hence this study was conducted to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. The aim was to assess the antibacterial efficacy of bromelain on both aerobic and anaerobic periodontal microorganisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of bromelain was tested on isolated strains of Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus fecalis Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) using serial dilution broth method. RESULTS: S. mutans showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 2 mg/ml as compared to E fecalis (31.25 mg/ml) while Pgingivalis showed sensitivity at the lowest concentration of 4.15 mg/ml as compared to Aa (16.6 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Bromelain exerts an antibacterial effect against potent periodontal pathogens; hence, it may be used as an antibacterial agent. However, further trial has to be conducted to validate this result.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of lemongrass oil against oral malodour micro-organisms and  the pilot study of safety and efficacy of lemongrass mouthrinse on oral malodour.
AB  - AIMS: Lemongrass oil (LG) has been reported as being effective against bacteria embedded within the biofilm. The aims of this study were to investigate antimicrobial activity against common odourigenic micro-organisms, the safety and efficacy of LG mouthrinse on oral malodour in healthy volunteers. METHODS AND RESULTS: Antimicrobial activity of LG mouthrinse was examined against common odourigenic micro-organisms using broth microdilution assay and the disc diffusion method. A randomised double-blind clinical study was performed in 20 healthy volunteers. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) level was measured using a Halimeter on day 0 and day 8 in each volunteer. The results showed that LG mouthrinse was effective against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC43718 and Porphyromonas gingivalis W50 but less effective against Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175. In addition, the mouthrinse significantly reduced VSCs on day 8. CONCLUSIONS: LG mouthrinse was able to reduce oral malodour and appeared to be safe. The overall satisfaction of the mouthrinse was acceptable. However, the spiciness and taste of the mouthrinse need to be improved. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrated that the LG mouthrinse significantly reduced oral malodour. This mouthrinse would be another alternative mouthrinse choice for prevention of malodour, plaque and gingivitis.
TI  - Association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in PCOS, compared to systemic health. A total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with PCOS and healthy periodontium, 35 women with PCOS and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically healthy women with gingivitis. Salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by ELISA. In women with PCOS, salivary Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus oralis and Tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women, particularly in the case of gingivitis. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. The presence of PCOS also enhanced P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and S. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. Gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in PCOS. The presence of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. In conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, PCOS may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. The most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on P. gingivalis.
TI  - The presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. However, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. METHODS: The research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24 were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. Information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery, general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. At 12 months of age, both groups of infants were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and dental plaque samples were collected. The microorganisms (Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp., Actinomyces spp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a PCR-based method. The chi-squared and Fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. RESULTS: The infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of Fusosbacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. Periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. A significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of S. mutans. Most of the very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of S. mutans in full-term infants than in premature infants.
TI  - Nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine (CHX) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure CHX (Nano-CHX), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The release of CHX from the Nano-CHX was characterized by UV/visible absorption spectroscopy. The antimicrobial properties of Nano-CHX were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. The Nano-CHX demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/mL against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococccus faecalis. Moreover, Nano-CHX effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as S. mutans, F. nucleatum, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the Nano-CHX on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of exogenous nitric oxide on periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Current treatments for periodontitis (e.g., scaling/root planing and chlorhexidine) have limited efficacy since they fail to suppress microbial biofilms satisfactorily over time, and the use of adjunctive antimicrobials can promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms. Herein, we report the novel application of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing scaffolds (i.e., dendrimers and silica particles) as anti-periodontopathogenic agents. The effectiveness of macromolecular NO release was demonstrated by a 3-log reduction in periodontopathogenic Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis viability. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguinis, caries-associated organisms, were substantially less sensitive to NO treatment. Both dendrimer- and silica-based NO release exhibited substantially less toxicity to human gingival fibroblasts at concentrations necessary to eradicate periodontopathogens than did clinical concentrations of chlorhexidine. These results suggest the potential utility of macromolecular NO-release scaffolds as a novel platform for the development of periodontal disease therapeutics.
TI  - Evaluation of a new oral health scale of infectious potential based on the salivary microbiota.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). Saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. RESULTS: In comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Prevotella gingivalis). In comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (CFU/mL log10) of facultative anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (S. mutans, Lactobacillus spp. and Actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (A. actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Campylobacter spp. and Fusobacterium spp.). CONCLUSION: Our new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.
TI  - An in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. The aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species used represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. The number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative PCR (qPCR). As outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. RESULTS: The bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. Different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. SIGNIFICANCE: While the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.
TI  - Development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. Understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. Therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. We therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) and gold standard chlorhexidine (CHX) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. METHODS: An in vitro multi-species biofilm containing S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in OKF6-TERT2. Cytotoxicity studies were performed using RSV and CHX. Multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. Biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. RESULTS: CHX was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. RSV did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. In co-culture, CHX-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine IL-8 at both mRNA and protein level. RSV-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of IL-8 protein, but not mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: CHX possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. RSV does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. This study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use of a biofilm co-culture model.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of extracts from Ugandan medicinal plants used for oral  care.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Medicinal plants are widely used for treatment of oral/dental diseases in Uganda. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate antibacterial activities of 16 commonly used medicinal plants on microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases (PD) and dental caries (DC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pulp juice and solvent extracts (hexane, methanol and water) from the plants were tested against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia associated with PD and Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus associated with DC. Tests were done using agar well-diffusion (pulp juice) and agar-dilution (Solvent extracts) assays. RESULTS: Pulp juice from Zanthoxylum chalybeum and Euclea latidens showed activity against all the bacteria, Zanthoxylum chalybeum being most active. Hexane extract from aerial part of Helichrysum odoratissimum was most active (MIC: 0.125-0.5 mg/ml). Methanol extract from leaves of Lantana trifolia showed activity against all bacteria (MIC: 0.25-1 mg/ml). CONCLUSION: Several of the tested plants showed antibacterial activities against bacteria associated with PD and DC, meriting further investigations.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of Myrtus communis oil on some clinically isolated oral pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the antimicrobial activities of Myrtus communis oil (MCO) on some oral pathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty strains of Streptococcus mutans, Aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and 20 strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Candida albicans isolated from patients with dental caries, periodontal diseases, pharyngitis and oral lesions associated with artificial dentures were used for the antimicrobial activity of MCO. The oil was prepared by hydrodistillation procedures using a Clevenger apparatus. Agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods were performed on various concentrations of MCO (3.9-1,000 microg/ml) using all the pathogens isolated. RESULTS: All isolates were sensitive to MCO at 125-1,000 microg/ml by agar disk diffusion producing inhibition zones of 8.1-41.25 mm in diameter. All of the S. pyogenes, S. mutans and C. albicans strains were sensitive to 62.5 microg/ml while 70% (21/30) of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 66.6% (20/30) of P. gingivalis were resistant to these concentrations. All S. pyogenes and S. mutans strains were sensitive to 31.25 microg/ml. All S. pyogenes strains were sensitive to 15.6 and 7.8 microg/ml of MCO. None of the clinical isolates in this study were sensitive to 3.9 microg/ml or to a lower concentration of oil. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of MCO for S. pyogenes, S. mutans, C. albicans, A.actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were 29.68 +/- 4.8, 31.25 +/- 0, 46.9 +/- 16, 62.5 +/- 0 and 62.5 +/- 0 microg/ml, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained in this study revealed a strong antimicrobial activity of MCO on the tested oral pathogens, and MCO could therefore be useful in the prevention of the related oral infections.
TI  - Improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-II photosensitizers.
AB  - Increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. This demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) uses light activated photosensitizers (PS) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. Positively charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of PS for light-mediated killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield PhiDelta of >97%. Upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase C8, 1260 +/- 50 mW/cm(2)) the PS showed high activity against the oral key pathogens Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. At a concentration of 10 muM, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 J/cm(2)) after one single treatment. The pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.
TI  - Bacterial pathogenesis: Bacteria choose to fight and flee.
AB  
TI  - Bacterial fight-and-flight responses enhance virulence in a polymicrobial infection.
AB  - The oral pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) resides in infection sites with many microbes, including commensal streptococci such as Streptococcus gordonii (Sg). During infection, Sg promotes the virulence of Aa by producing its preferred carbon source, l-lactate, a phenomenon referred to as cross-feeding. However, as with many streptococci, Sg also produces high levels of the antimicrobial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), leading to the question of how Aa deals with this potent antimicrobial during coinfection. Here, we show that Aa possesses two complementary responses to H2O2: a detoxification or fight response mediated by catalase (KatA) and a dispersion or flight response mediated by Dispersin B (DspB), an enzyme that dissolves Aa biofilms. Using a murine abscess infection model, we show that both of these responses are required for Sg to promote Aa virulence. Although the role of KatA is to detoxify H2O2 during coinfection, 3D spatial analysis of mixed infections revealed that DspB is required for Aa to spatially organize itself at an optimal distance (>4 microm) from Sg, which we propose allows cross-feeding but reduces exposure to inhibitory levels of H2O2. In addition, these behaviors benefit not only Aa but also Sg, suggesting that fight and flight stimulate the fitness of the community. These results reveal that an antimicrobial produced by a human commensal bacterium enhances the virulence of a pathogenic bacterium by modulating its spatial location in the infection site.
TI  - A periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  - PURPOSE: While single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. METHODS: Streptococcus gordonii KN1, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC23726, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC33384, and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 were used for this experiment. The biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. Four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. The biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. The MICs of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. RESULTS: The CLSM and SEM examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. However, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. The MICs of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. The MIC of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, or A. actinomycetemcomitans. The MIC of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of P. gingivalis or F. nucleatum. CONCLUSIONS: To mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. The 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.
TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (PDS II(R)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (MET) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibrous matrices were processed from PDS polymer solution by electrospinning. Antibiotic-containing PDS solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% MET, 25 wt.% MET, 5 wt.% CIP, and 25 wt.% CIP. Pure PDS was used as a control. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to evaluate MET and CIP release. Dual-species biofilms formed by Lactobacillus casei (Lc) and Streptococcus salivarius (Ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. After 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) using agar diffusion assay. RESULTS: A three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. Pure PDS showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% MET (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% MET (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% CIP (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% CIP (765 +/- 288 nm). HPLC demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. No inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. Meanwhile, CIP-containing matrices inhibited growth of Fn and Aa. CONCLUSION: CIP-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.
TI  - Cyclodextrin modulates the cytotoxic effects of chlorhexidine on microrganisms and cells in vitro.
AB  - Although several studies have shown that chlorhexidine (Cx) has bactericidal activity and exerts toxic effects on periodontal tissues a few studies evaluated mechanisms to reduce its adverse effects maintaining the antimicrobial properties. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cellular cytotoxicity of Cx included on cyclodextrins (Cd), alpha, beta or Hp-beta-cyclodextrins (Hp-beta-Cd). The influence of Cds was determined by increasing its molar rate 1:1 to 1:4 in relation with free Cx. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans actinomycemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans were determined. An ergosterol solubilization assay was carried out using the C. albicans model and osteoblasts, fibroblasts and tumoral Caco-2 cells for cytotoxicity assay. The antimicrobial activity results in a significant growth inhibition of C. albicans when it was treated with Cx:alpha-Cd complexes, whereas Cx:beta-Cd was more effective for A. actinomycetemcomitans, and Cx:Hp-beta-Cd complexes was for S. mutans when compared to the other complexes. The cytotoxicity for fibroblasts and osteoblasts decreased in relation with each kind of Cd been beta-Cd </= Hp-beta-Cd </= alpha-Cd. Although the Hp-beta-Cd inclusion complexes had more severe effects on Caco-2 cells, all complexes exhibited less cytotoxicity than free Cx. The alpha-Cd, beta-Cd and Hp-beta-Cd increase the antimicrobial activity of Cx, but decrease its cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. Taken together these findings suggest that cyclodextrins are a tool for modulation of effects of Cx. It could be useful to design Cx/Cd delivery systems with high efficacy and minimum cytotoxic effects.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. We sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe AE-COPD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe AE-COPD. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16S rDNA sequences and cDNA libraries. We used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial 16S rDNA sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. RESULTS: Analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. Species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16S rDNA sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16S rDNA indicated lower levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. CONCLUSION: These results support the hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe AE-COPD.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine O on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. In this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) may play a crucial part in the future. The aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency of aPDT using the photosensitizer safranine O with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% CHX) on an ex vivo biofilm. METHODS: First the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of Streptococcus gordonii ATCC 33399, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 10953, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 33384 and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 was observed. Then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. The antibacterial effects of aPDT and of 0.2% CHX were determined on the ex vivo biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. After cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). RESULTS: Photodynamic treatment with safranine O showed a distinct antibacterial effect on F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Whereas S. gordonii was suppressed completely by aPDT, treatment with 0.2% CHX caused only a partial reduction. In the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), aPDT caused a significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% CHX. Compared to the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by aPDT with safranine O. Especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% CHX. Both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.
TI  - Comparison of the penetration and passage of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans through membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed at comparing the colonization and passage of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) through polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine. METHODS: In this in vitro study, PTFE and ADM membranes were loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine. The colonization and crossing of S. mutans and Aa through these membranes were evaluated using vials containing culture medium. Three-way analysis of variance and Tukey's honestly significant difference test were used for the statistical analyses (p<0.05). RESULTS: The membranes loaded with antimicrobial agents significantly decreased bacterial passage compared with the control membranes (not loaded with antimicrobial agents). Significant differences were also detected between membranes in their inhibitory properties (p=0.011). PTFE membrane had higher barrier effect than ADM. Tetracycline had greater antibacterial activity against both species compared with amoxicillin (p=0.021) but had no significant difference with chlorhexidine in this respect (p=0.068). The antimicrobial efficacy of chlorhexidine was in between those of tetracycline and amoxicillin, but the difference between amoxicillin and chlorhexidine in this respect was not statistically significant (p=0.992). Aa had better penetration into the membranes compared with S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: The study results demonstrated that the penetration of S. mutans and Aa decreased into the membranes loaded with tetracycline, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine and PTFE membrane had a greater barrier effect than ADM. Loading membranes with antimicrobial agents can effectively reduce membrane-associated infections during regenerative procedures.
TI  - Dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  - AIM: We aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (BS) and non-discoloured plaque. METHODS: Forty-six children with BS and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. Dental caries was scored using WHO criteria. Samples of BS and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. The DNA of the samples was extracted and real-time PCR was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus sp., Actinomyces naeslundii, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum. RESULTS: Children with BS had lower DMFT (p = 0.013), lower DT values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. Plaque samples of the BS group contained higher numbers of A. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of F. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. Comparing the children with BS and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for A. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with BS while in caries-affected children with BS, lower counts of F. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. Counts of Lactobacillus sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in BS of caries-free and caries-affected children. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the different microbial composition of BS might be associated with the lower caries experience in affected subjects. The role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.
TI  - Antibiogram pattern of oral microflora in periodontic children of age group 6 to  12 years: a clinicomicrobiological study.
AB  - AIM: The study was carried out to see the diversity of oral microflora and its antibiotic sensitivity test in children of age group 6 to 12 years was carried. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 50 patients of age group 6 to 12 years were analyzed for their oral microflora and then checked for the antibiotic susceptibility test. The samples that were collected were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Once dispersed samples were taken and Gram staining was done, also they were spread on to a number of freshly prepared agar plates and incubated to allow cells to form microbial colony. RESULTS: The result showed microflora common in all types, Gram-positive facultative anaerobic rods and cocci. In normal children Gram-positive facultative anaerobic and fermenting cocci were predominant where as in children with caries growth of microbiota that were Gram-negative and positive, capnophilic, motile and anaerobic rods and cocci belonging to members of genera S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans was seen. CONCLUSION: By the present study it has been concluded that the number of bacteria determined by microscopic counts was twice as high in caries patients as in healthy sites, and also recommended that amoxicillin, ampicillin and amikacin are the most effective antibacterial drugs for the treatment of dental caries.
TI  - Smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. Cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. This study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (IL)-1ss, IL-10, prostaglandin E2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum IgG antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (Veillonella parvula, Streptococcus sanguis, Prevotella loescheii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga ochracea). RESULTS: The patients were stratified into health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. Of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only IL-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. As might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. IL-1ss and antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. Smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. We tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. For all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. In contrast, antibacterial activity against any of the bacterial species tested (S. aureus, E. faecalis, E. coli, S. salivarius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus mutans, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection treatment up to 40 times. This finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. The active ingredient of this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of H2O2. Therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. In conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of H2O2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.
TI  - Pro-oxidative synergic bactericidal effect of NO: kinetics and inhibition by nitroxides.
AB  - NO plays diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes, occasionally  resulting in opposing effects, particularly in cells subjected to oxidative stress. NO mostly protects eukaryotes against oxidative injury, but was demonstrated to kill prokaryotes synergistically with H2O2. This could be a promising therapeutic avenue. However, recent conflicting findings were reported describing dramatic protective activity of NO. The previous studies of NO effects on prokaryotes applied a transient oxidative stress while arbitrarily checking the residual bacterial viability after 30 or 60min and ignoring the process kinetics. If NO-induced synergy and the oxidative stress are time-dependent, the elucidation of the cell killing kinetics is essential, particularly for survival curves exhibiting a "shoulder" sometimes reflecting sublethal damage as in the linear-quadratic survival models. We studied the kinetics of NO synergic effects on H2O2-induced killing of microbial pathogens. A synergic pro-oxidative activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive cells is demonstrated even at sub-muM/min flux of NO. For certain strains, the synergic effect progressively increased with the duration of cell exposure, and the linear-quadratic survival model best fit the observed survival data. In contrast to the failure of SOD to affect the bactericidal process, nitroxide SOD mimics abrogated the pro-oxidative synergy of NO/H2O2. These cell-permeative antioxidants, which hardly react with diamagnetic species and react neither with NO nor with H2O2, can detoxify redox-active transition metals and catalytically remove intracellular superoxide and nitrogen-derived reactive species such as (*)NO2 or peroxynitrite. The possible mechanism underlying the bactericidal NO synergy under oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic gain are discussed.
TI  - Does photodynamic therapy enhance standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess whether or not photodynamic therapy enhanced standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry. BACKGROUND DATA: Photodynamic therapy when used as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy kills more bacteria than when conventional periodontal therapy is used alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address the focused question, "Does photodynamic therapy enhance killing of oral bacteria?" PubMed/MEDLINE((R)) and Google Scholar databases were explored. Original human and experimental studies and studies using photodynamic therapy for killing oral bacteria were included. Letters to the Editor, historic reviews, and unpublished data were excluded. RESULTS: Photodynamic therapy significantly reduces periodontopathogenic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Photodynamic therapy kills cariogenic bacteria (such as Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis), bacteria associated with infected root canals, and those associated with periimplantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Photodynamic therapy, when used as an adjunct to conventional oral disinfection protocols, enhances standard antibacterial therapy in dentistry.
TI  - Oral community interactions of Filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  - Filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. In the oral cavity F. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between F. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. Here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of F. alocis with Streptococcus gordonii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. In an in vitro community development model, S. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of F. alocis into a dual species community. In contrast, F. nucleatum and the type strain of F. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. Accumulation of a low passage isolate of F. alocis was also enhanced by F. nucleatum. In three species communities of S. gordonii, F. nucleatum and F. alocis, the antagonistic effects of S. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of F. nucleatum toward F. alocis. The interaction between A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. alocis was strain specific and A. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate F. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. P. gingivalis and F. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of P. gingivalis greater than in the absence of F. alocis. However, while P. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of F. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to F. alocis alone. The inhibitory effect of P. gingivalis toward F. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the Mfa1 fimbrial subunit. In addition, AI-2 production by P. gingivalis helped maintain levels of F. alocis. Collectively, these results show that the pattern of F. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in F. nucleatum.
TI  - Microarray analysis of microbiota of gingival lesions in noma patients.
AB  - Noma (cancrum oris) is a gangrenous disease of unknown etiology affecting the maxillo-facial region of young children in extremely limited resource countries. In an attempt to better understand the microbiological events occurring during this disease, we used phylogenetic and low-density microarrays targeting the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the gingival flora of acute noma and acute necrotizing gingivitis (ANG) lesions, and compared them to healthy control subjects of the same geographical and social background. Our observations raise doubts about Fusobacterium necrophorum, a previously suspected causative agent of noma, as this species was not associated with noma lesions. Various oral pathogens were more abundant in noma lesions, notably Atopobium spp., Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus anginosus. On the other hand, pathogens associated with periodontal diseases such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Porphyromonas spp. and Fusobacteriales were more abundant in healthy controls. Importantly, the overall loss of bacterial diversity observed in noma samples as well as its homology to that of ANG microbiota supports the hypothesis that ANG might be the immediate step preceding noma.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - Bacterial adhesion to antibiotic-loaded guided tissue regeneration membranes - a  scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Bacterial contamination of sites undergoing guided tissue regeneration (GTR) therapy may reduce the efficiency of periodontal regeneration. This study compared bacterial adhesion onto various GTR membranes incorporated with antibiotics. METHODS: Three barrier membranes, including expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, collagen membrane, and glycolide fiber membrane, were loaded with tetracycline or amoxicillin. The adhesion of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans onto the GTR membranes with or without antibiotics was analyzed using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. RESULTS: The SEM analysis showed no apparent alteration in the physical structure of the membranes loaded with antibiotics. Both S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans attached best on the collagen membranes, followed by the ePTFE membranes, and then the glycolide fiber membranes without antibiotics. Moreover, higher numbers of bacteria were observed on the fibril areas than on the laminar areas of the ePTFE membranes. The amounts of attached bacteria on the GTR membranes increased after longer incubation. Incorporation of tetracycline or amoxicillin greatly reduced the adhesion of S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans onto all of the GTR membranes examined. CONCLUSION: Incorporation of tetracycline or amoxicillin greatly reduced adhesion of S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans on the ePTFE, glycolide fiber, or collagen membranes. This finding indicates that it is valuable and effective to use the antibiotic-loaded GTR membranes for periodontal regeneration therapy.
TI  - Characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular fluid flow conditions. The aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. Biofilms were established using a modified Robbins device on hydroxyapatite (HAP) discs. Three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, Live/Dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). Finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (CHX), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (CHX+NaF) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (CHX+CPC)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in our 4-d biofilm model. RESULTS: The viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. The architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the HAP. The effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. Moreover, it was observed that in 4-d biofilm formed in vitro, CHX+CPC caused significantly higher mortality compared with CHX (p = 0.003) and CHX+NaF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. It also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.
TI  - A consortium of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and Filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (LAP) in African-American adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. Two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. Seventy-one A. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. Gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. Disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (BL). Subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of A. actinomycetemcomitans in BL and (ii) the association of A. actinomycetemcomitans and other microbes in their relationships to BL. Sixteen of 63 subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans developed BL (the other 47 subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans had no BL). No A. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed BL. Human oral microbe identification microarray (HOMIM) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. On a subject level, pooled data from A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of Streptococcus and Actinomyces species, while A. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with BL had higher prevalences of Parvimonas micra, Filifactor alocis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and Peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (HOT-113). At vulnerable sites, A. actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus parasanguinis, and F. alocis levels were elevated prior to BL. In cases where the three-organism consortium (versus A. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future BL increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. We conclude that detecting the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. parasanguinis, and F. alocis together indicates sites of future BL in LAP. A synergistic interaction of this consortium in LAP causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.
TI  - The connection between ruptured cerebral aneurysms and odontogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms have excess long-term mortality due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases compared with general population. Chronic inflammation is detected in ruptured intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and coronary artery plaques. Bacterial infections have been suggested to have a role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. Bacteria have been detected both in abdominal and coronary arteries but their presence in intracranial aneurysms has not yet been properly studied. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this preliminary study was to assess the presence of oral and pharyngeal bacterial genome in ruptured intracranial aneurysms and to ascertain if dental infection is a previously unknown risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage. METHODS: A total of 36 ruptured aneurysm specimens were obtained perioperatively in aneurysm clipping operations (n=29) and by autopsy (n=7). Aneurysmal sac tissue was analysed by real time quantitative PCR with specific primers and probes to detect bacterial DNA from several oral species. Immunohistochemical staining for bacterial receptors (CD14 and toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2)) was performed from four autopsy cases. RESULTS: Bacterial DNA was detected in 21/36 (58%) of specimens. A third of the positive samples contained DNA from both endodontic and periodontal bacteria. DNA from endodontic bacteria were detected in 20/36 (56%) and from periodontal bacteria in 17/36 (47%) of samples. Bacterial DNA of the Streptococcus mitis group was found to be most common. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola were the three most common periodontal pathogens. The highly intensive staining of CD14 and TLR-2 in ruptured aneurysms was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report showing evidence that dental infection could be a part of pathophysiology in intracranial aneurysm disease.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. This study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with CP. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with CP in the United States. The samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/L, clindamycin at 4 mg/L, doxycycline at 4 mg/L, and metronidazole at 16 mg/L, with a post hoc combination of data for amoxicillin and metronidazole. Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. RESULTS: Overall, 74.2% of the patients with CP revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. One or more test species, most often Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Streptococcus constellatus, or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with CP, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either S. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of Gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CP in the United States frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. The wide variability found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with CP.
TI  - No evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (TCS)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to TCS toothpaste. Therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to TCS in toothpaste selects for TCS-resistant bacteria within the oral biofilm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. Participants had been randomly assigned to use TCS (3000 mug/mL TCS) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n = 22). Diluted plaque samples were plated on to Wilkins-Chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and TCS (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/mL) and incubated at 37 degrees C under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. Selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16S rDNA sequencing and TCS minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined for each isolate. RESULTS: At 3000 mug/mL TCS no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. The MICs of TCS for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/mL in both groups. Species common to both groups had similar MICs. Veillonella parvula and Campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar MICs in both groups. CONCLUSION: The use of TCS-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in MIC of TCS of oral bacterial isolates.
TI  - Effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. Bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy agar (TSA) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. The autofluorescence was then assessed at 405 nm excitation. On the TSA without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. On the TSA containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from Parvimonas micra. When the TSA was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin K, red autofluorescence was observed from Actinomyces naeslundii, Bifidobacterium dentium, and Streptococcus mutans. Finally, on the TSA supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, A. naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Lactobacillus salivarius, S. mutans, and Veillonella parvula. We conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. The autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.
TI  - The microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. Assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. The samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures. In order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. The colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. Alterations in the presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey's test post hoc. RESULTS: The average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. The bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. CONCLUSION: The anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.
TI  - Randomized controlled trial: lip piercing: the impact of material on microbiological findings.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are microbiological differences in bacterial samples collected from labial piercings made of different materials. METHODS: Sterile piercings of 4 materials were randomly allocated to 80 pierced subjects. After 2 weeks, microbiologic samples were collected and processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. Wilcoxon signed ranks and Mann-Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis (adjustment for multiple comparisons). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between material groups in relation to baseline data. In samples from stainless steel piercings, the total microbial load was significantly higher than the other materials (P<.05). Ten (mainly periopathogenic) species were found at significantly higher levels (P<.001) on steel than on polypropylene and/or polytetrafluoroethylene piercings. CONCLUSIONS: Labial piercings made of stainless steel could promote the development of a pathogenic biofilm.
TI  - Quantitative real-time PCR combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. This is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. The objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) combined with propidium monoazide (PMA), developed for the selective quantification of viable P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PMA-qPCR method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. Matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. Biofilms were disrupted and PMA added (final concentration of 100 mum). After DNA isolation, qPCR was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. The differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. RESULTS: When PMA was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qPCR amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). Conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, PMA resulted in a significant total reduction of qPCR amplification of about 4 log10 . P. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the efficiency of PMA for differentiating viable and dead P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. Hence, this PMA-qPCR method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.
TI  - Cluster of bacteria associated with peri-implantitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the microbiota in peri-implantitis is limited. We hypothesized that neither gender nor a history of periodontitis/smoking or the microbiota at implants differ by implant status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Baseline microbiological samples collected at one implant in each of 166 participants with peri-implantitis and from 47 individuals with a healthy implant were collected and analyzed by DNA-DNA checkerboard hybridization (78 species). Clinical and radiographic data defined implant status. RESULTS: Nineteen bacterial species were found at higher counts from implants with peri-implantitis including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Helicobacter pylori, Haemophilus influenzae, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mitis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii (p < .001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified T. forsythia, P. gingivalis, T. socranskii, Staph. aureus, Staph. anaerobius, Strep. intermedius, and Strep. mitis in peri-implantitis comprising 30% of the total microbiota. When adjusted for gender (not significant [NS]), smoking status (NS), older age (p = .003), periodontitis history (p < .01), and T. forsythia (likelihood ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4, 9.1, p = .007) were associated with peri-implantitis. CONCLUSION: A cluster of bacteria including T. forsythia and Staph. aureus are associated with peri-implantitis.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of green tea (Camellia sinensis) extract on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the in vitro inhibitory activity of green tea extract on  some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty strains of each of Streptococcusmutans, Aggregatibacteractinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonasgingivalis, and Prevotellaintermedia were isolated from carious teeth and periodontal pockets of patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. Green tea extract was prepared by aqueous extraction method and diluted from 50 to 1.56 mg/ml. Standard techniques of agar disk diffusion and broth microdilution assays were applied for qualitative and quantitative determinations of antibacterial activity of green tea extract on each isolates. RESULTS: All clinical isolates of S. mutans (100%) were sensitive to green tea extract at concentrations 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ml producing inhibition zones ranging from 10 to 38 mm. All periodontopathic isolates (A. actinomycetemcomitans, n = 20, P. intermedia, n = 20, and P. gingivalis, n = 20) (100%) tested were sensitive to 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ml of this extract. The minimal inhibitory concentration of green tea extract for S. mutans was 3.28 +/- 0.7 mg/ml and for A. actinomycetemcomitans 6.25, for P. gingivalis and P. intermedia 12.5 mg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that green tea extract exhibited strong antibacterial activity on S. mutans,A. actinomycetemcomitans,P. gingivalis and P. intermedia and therefore may be used in mouthwashes or dentifrices for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial and anticancer potential of hinokitiol against oral pathogens and oral cancer cell lines.
AB  - Hinokitiol is a natural component isolated from Chamacyparis taiwanensis. It has  anti-microbial activity, and has been used in oral care products. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) of hinokitiol against MRSA, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, and Candida albicans were determined by the agar and broth dilution method (MIC: 40-110muM; MMC: 50-130muM); the paradoxical inhibition phenomenon (PIP) was observed in A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mutans. The PIP can be described as microbial growth occurring in the presence of both high and low concentrations of a compound, between which microbial growth is inhibited. The PIP was confirmed using a kinetic microplate and inhibition zone methods. The PIP was also observed in MRSA. The low autolysin activity somehow correlated to the PIP positive. The cell diameter was increased in all the pathogens, and the transition was inhibited in C. albicans following hinokitiol treatment. Hinokitiol is also a potential anticancer drug. The 200muM of hinokitiol has significant antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities against oral pathogens and oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, respectively, and lower cytotoxic effects for normal human oral keratinocytes, indicating that hinokitiol displays a high potential for safe and effective applications in oral health care.
TI  - Evaluating the antimicrobial activity of commercially available herbal toothpastes on microorganisms associated with diabetes mellitus.
AB  - AIM: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effcacy of commercially available herbal toothpastes against the different periodontopathogens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six herbal toothpastes that were commonly commercially available were included in the study. Colgate herbal, Babool, Meswak, Neem active, Dabur red toothpastes were tested for the study whereas sterile normal saline was used as control. Antimicrobial effcacies of dentifrices were evaluated against Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The antimicrobial properties of dentifrices were tested by measuring the maximum zone of inhibition at 24 hours on the Mueller Hinton Agar media inoculated with microbial strain using disk diffusion method. Each dentifrice was tested at 100% concentration (full strength). RESULTS: The study showed that all dentifrices selected for the study were effective against the entire test organism but to varying degree. Neem active tooth paste gave a reading of 25.4 mm as the zone of inhibition which was highest amongst all of the test dentifrices. Colgate Herbal and Meswak dentifrices recorded a larger maximum zone of inhibition, measuring 23 and 22.6 mm respectively, compared to other toothpastes. All other dentifrices showed the zone of inhibition to be between 17 and 19 mm respectively. CONCLUSION: The antibacterial properties of six dentifrices were studied in vitro and concluded that almost all of the dentifrices available commercially had antibacterial properties to some extent to beneft dental health or antiplaque action.
TI  - Can salivary activity predict periodontal breakdown in A. actinomycetemcomitans infected adolescents?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is highly associated  with localised aggressive periodontitis (LAP) many Aa-carriers do not develop LAP. This study was designed to determine whether specific salivary factors could distinguish between subjects who have Aa initially and remain healthy (H/AA) as compared to those who develop LAP (LAP/AA). DESIGN: H/AA subjects and healthy controls with no Aa (H) were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study to investigate initiation of bone loss (LAP) over 3 years. After detection of LAP, stored saliva from 10 H, 10 H/AA, and 10 LAP/AA subjects was thawed, processed, and tested for (1) lactoferrin (Lf) concentration and iron levels; (2) agglutination of Aa; (3) killing of Gram-positive bacteria. RESULTS: LAP/AA saliva levels of Lf iron were low prior to and after bone loss (3.6+1.7ngFe/mug) (LAP/AA vs. H and H/AA p</=0.01). Saliva from H/AA subjects caused Aa to agglutinate significantly more than H or LAP/AA saliva (p</=0.01). LAP/AA saliva killed Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis and Lactobacillus in vitro by >83%. Saliva from H individuals killed these bacteria by <3.3% (LAP/AA vs. H; p</=0.01). H/AA killing was intermediate. CONCLUSION: LAP/AA saliva showed: low levels of Lf iron, minimal Aa agglutinating activity, and high killing activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Aa-positive healthy saliva (H/AA) showed: higher levels of Lf iron, maximal Aa agglutinating activity, and moderate killing of Gram-positive bacteria. A salivary activity profile can distinguish between subjects who are Aa-positive and remain healthy from those who develop LAP.
TI  - Optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tanerella forsythia and Treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. RESULTS: Eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using BLAST analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mFOLD). The most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qPCR-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility. For the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of DNA extracts from isolates of closely related species. For these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the Applied Biosystems 7300, the Bio-Rad iQ5 and the Roche Light Cycler 480). For all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. The overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the Light Cycler 480. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of S. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus Fusobacterium.This can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.
TI  - Evaluation of bacterial adhesion on machined titanium, Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) discs.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial adhesion and colonization play a crucial function in the pathogenesis of peri-implant tissue infection, which is considered the main cause of fixture loss. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in bacterial adhesion between a machined titanium surface, a double acid etched surface (Osseotite(R)) and an Osseotite surface with Nanometer-scale Discrete Crystalline Deposition (DCD) of calcium phosphate (CaP)(Nanotite(R)). METHODS: Surface roughness properties of each sample were determined by a laser profilometer and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. Bacterial adhesion on machined, Osseotite(R), and Nanotite(R) discs were performed using the following bacterial strains: Streptococcus mutans CCUG 35176, Streptococcus sanguis CCUG 17826, Streptococcus salivarius CCUG 11878, Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans CCUG 37002, Porphyromonas gingivalis CCUG 2521. The assessment of bacterial adhesion was performed by comparing two methods: Total Viable Count (TVC) estimation and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopic (CSLM) studies. RESULTS: The surface roughness parameter increased as follows: machined<Nanotite(R)<Osseotite(R). The attachment of all bacterial strains performed by both methods showed a significant reduction on Osseotite(R) and even higher on Nanotite(R) in comparison to machined surfaces (p<0.05). The reduction in bacterial attachment was more significant on Osseotite(R) and Nanotite(R) for A. actinomycetecomitans, S. mutans and S. sanguis than for P. gingivalis and S. salivarius strains. CONCLUSIONS: Nanotite(R) samples showed the lowest amount of bacterial contamination in comparison to the smoother machined and rougher Osseotite(R) surfaces.
TI  - Antibacterial Activity of Myristica fragrans against Oral Pathogens.
AB  - Myristica fragrans Houtt is mostly cultivated for spices in Penang Island, Malaysia. The ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts of flesh, mace and seed of Myristica fragrans was evaluated the bactericidal potential against three Gram-positive cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mitis ATCC 6249, and Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419) and three Gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 29522, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277, and Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586). Antibacterial activities of the extracts was determined by twofold serial microdilution, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.25 to 640 mg/mL and 0.075 to 40 mg/mL. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was obtained by subculturing method. Among all extracts tested, ethyl acetate extract of flesh has the highest significant inhibitory effects against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with mean MIC value ranging from 0.625 to 1.25 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL; P = 0.017) and highest bactericidal effects at mean MBC value ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 20 +/- 0.00 (SD) mg/mL. While for seed and mace of Myristica fragrans, their ethanol extracts exhibited good antibacterial activity against both groups of test pathogens compared to its ethyl acetate extracts. All of the extracts of Myristica fragrans did not show any antibacterial activities against Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586. Thus, our study showed the potential effect of ethyl acetate and ethanol extracts from flesh, seed and mace of Myristica fragrans to be new natural agent that can be incorporated in oral care products.
TI  - A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  - AIM: This 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (Listerine((R)) Coolmint; Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. At baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (PI), gingivitis index (GI), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (BoP) and clinical attachment level were registered. Subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, Micromonas micros, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium genus and Streptococcus mutans by means of real-time PCR (qPCR). Patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age: 57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean PI <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. Gingivitis index, PI and BoP significantly reduced over time (P </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. There was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. Daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. CONCLUSION: Patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.
TI  - Bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. Growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. The quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. Compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. CONCLUSION: It was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.
TI  - Microbiological characterization in children with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterize the subgingival microbiota of African-American children with Localized Aggressive Periodontitis (LAP). Fifty-one children were included. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from diseased (DD) and healthy sites (DH) in LAP and from healthy sites in HS and HC and analyzed by 16S rRNA-based microarrays. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) was the only species found to be both more prevalent (OR = 8.3, p = 0.0025) and abundant (p < 0.01) in DD. Filifactor alocis (Fa) was also found to be more prevalent in DD (OR 2.31, CI 1.06-5.01, p = 0.03). Most prevalent species in healthy sites were Selenomonas spp, Veillonella spp, Streptococcus spp, Bergeyella sp, and Kingella oralis. Overall, Streptococcus spp, Campylobacter gracilis, Capnocytophaga granulosa, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and Lautropia mirabilis were most abundant in healthy children, while Aa, Fa, Tannerella sp, Solobacterium moorei, Parvimonas micra, and Capnocytophaga sp were most abundant in LAP. Based on a comprehensive analysis with 16S rRNA-based microarrays, Aa was strongly associated and site-specific in LAP. In contrast, other species were found to be associated with healthy sites and individuals (ClinicalTrials.gov number CT01330719). ABBREVIATIONS: healthy site in healthy sibling (HS); healthy site in healthy control child (HC).
TI  - Antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. Limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. Here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (BBE) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The effects of whole and fractionated BBE on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. The bactericidal effects of whole BBE against Fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs). Cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (OKF6) cells. RESULTS: BBE at 350-1400 mug/mL reduced the metabolic activity of Porphyromonas gingivalis, F. nucleatum and Streptococcus mutans. The reduced metabolic activity observed for F. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of CFUs following exposure to BBE for as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. An anthocyanin-enriched fraction of BBE reduced the metabolic activity of F. nucleatum, but not of P. gingivalis or S. mutans, suggesting the contribution of species-specific agents in the whole BBE. Oral epithelial cell viability was not reduced following exposure to whole BBE (2.24-1400 mug/mL) for </= 6 h. CONCLUSION: BBE alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. The specific antibacterial properties of BBE shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial Constituents of Artemisia afra Jacq. ex Willd. against Periodontal  Pathogens.
AB  - The phytochemical investigation of an ethanol extract of Artemisia afra led to the isolation of six known compounds, acacetin (1), 12alpha,4alpha-dihydroxybishopsolicepolide (2), scopoletin (3), alpha-amyrin (4), phytol (5), and a pentacyclic triterpenoid betulinic acid (6). The compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces israelii, and Streptococcus mutans), Gram negative bacteria (Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans previously known as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Candida albicans. The crude extract of A. afra inhibited the growth of all tested microbial species at concentration range of 1.6 mg/mL to 25 mg/mL. The compounds 1-6 also showed activity range at 1.0 mg/mL to 0.25 mg/mL. Three best compounds (scopoletin, betulinic acid, and acacetin) which showed good antimicrobial activity were selected for further studies. Cytotoxicity of extract and compounds was determined using the XTT cell proliferation kit. The antioxidant activity of the extract and compounds was done using the DPPH scavenging method. The extract showed good antioxidant activity with an IC(50) value of 22.2 mug/mL. Scopoletin had a strong transformation of the DPPH radical into its reduced form, with an IC(50) value of 1.24 mug/mL which was significant to that of vitamin C (1.22 mug/mL). Acacetin and betulinic acid exhibited a decreased scavenging activity with the IC(50) of 2.39 and 2.42 mug/mL, respectively. The extract and compounds showed moderate toxicity on McCoy fibroblast cell line and scopoletin was relatively nontoxic with an IC(50) value of 132.5 mug/mL. Acacetin and betulinic acid also showed a smooth trend of non-toxic effects with IC(50) values of 35.44 and 30.96 mug/mL. The obtained results in this study confirm the use of A. afra in the treatment of microbial infections.
TI  - Peripheral arterial disease associated with caries and periodontal disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important cardiovascular disorder of the peripheral arteries. Chronic infections, such as periodontitis, may play an important role in the etiology and pathophysiology of PAD and other cardiovascular conditions. Recently, Streptococcus mutans has been found with high frequency in atheromatous plaques. The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible clinical and microbiologic association between PAD and periodontitis and dental caries. METHODS: Thirty patients with PAD and 30 control individuals were selected. PAD and its severity were established by the use of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). Clinical attachment loss (AL); probing depth; decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) index; and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were evaluated. The presence of bacterial DNA from Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival biofilm and serum. RESULTS: Patients with >/=30% AL >/= 4 mm had six-fold increased risk of having PAD (odds ratio = 8.18; 95% confidence interval = 1.21 to 35.23; P = 0.031). There was statistical difference in the CRP (P = 0.0413) and DMFT index (P = 0.0002), with elevated number of missing teeth (P = 0.0459) in the PAD group compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the frequency of bacteria in serum and subgingival plaque. CONCLUSION: There was a positive relationship between periodontitis based on AL and PAD determined by the ABI (odds ratio = 8.18).
TI  - Leakage of saliva through the implant-abutment interface: in vitro evaluation of  three different implant connections under unloaded and loaded conditions.
AB  - PURPOSE: Bacterial leakage along the implant-abutment interface, with consequent  species harboring the inner parts of two-part dental implant systems, has been reported in the literature. The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate bacterial leakage from human saliva to the internal part of the implants along the implant-abutment interface under loaded and unloaded conditions using DNA Checkerboard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty dental implants--20 each of external-hexagon, internal-hexagon, and Morse cone-connection designs--and their conical abutments were used in this study. Each group was subdivided into two groups of 10 loaded and 10 unloaded implants. The assemblies were immersed in human saliva and either (1) loaded with 500,000 cycles at 120 N (experimental group) or (2) incubated in static conditions for 7 days at 35 degrees C (unloaded control group). RESULTS: Microorganisms were found in the internal surfaces of all types of connections. The Morse cone connection presented the lowest count of microorganisms in both the unloaded and loaded groups. Loaded implants presented with higher counts of microorganisms than unloaded implants for external- and internal-hex connections. CONCLUSION: Bacterial species from human saliva may penetrate along the implant-abutment interface under both unloaded and loaded conditions for all connections evaluated. Morse cone-connection implants showed the lowest counts of microorganisms for both conditions. External- and internal-hex implants showed a higher incidence of bacteria and higher bacterial counts after simulated loading.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of Aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. In the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of Aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (Streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (Bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. Twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to Aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. S. mutans was the species most sensitive to Aloe vera gel with a MIC of 12.5 microg/ml, while A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and B. fragilis were less sensitive, with a MIC of 25-50 microg/ml (P < 0.01). Based on our present findings it is concluded that Aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.
TI  - Oral microbiota in Swiss adolescents.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a Swiss adolescent population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. Plaque index, bleeding on probing (BOP), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (DMFT) index were recorded. Samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Additionally, counts of Streptococus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were determined by real-time PCR. RESULTS: Periodontitis was not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival inflammation displaying a mean BOP of 28%. Ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for P. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythia, (47.5%) for T. denticola. T. denticola and S. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas T. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. DMFT was associated with S. mutans counts, and BOP correlated with counts of P. gingivalis and T. denticola. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among Swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in Swiss adolescents with gingivitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although gingivitis was a frequent finding in Swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. The dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. We report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding RNAs is stimulated. In the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. However, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. We also observed a significant upregulation of ABC transport systems and putative transposases. Changes in Clusters of Orthologous Groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of transcription factors were upregulated. Finally, we identified several small noncoding RNAs whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. These results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of the antibacterial efficacy of honey in vitro and antiplaque efficacy in a 4-day plaque regrowth model in vivo: preliminary results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Honey has a potent broad-spectrum antibacterial action that may make  it suitable for "anti-infective" treatment of periodontal disease. The aims of this study are as follows: 1) to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of honey against oral bacteria and compare the same with 0.2% chlorhexidine; and 2) to compare antiplaque efficacy in vivo with chlorhexidine. METHODS: The study was conducted in two parts. In the in vitro part, the inhibitory effects of three test agents, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, honey mouthwash, and saline, against six oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 mug/mL were tested in duplicate. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was set as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. The in vivo part consisted of a double-masked parallel clinical trial based on a 4-day plaque regrowth model. Sixty-six volunteers, 20 to 24 years of age, participated in the study, and the plaque scores were compared at baseline and at the end of 4 days. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for significance, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for pairwise comparison of the groups. The mean plaque scores were 1.77 +/- 0.86, 1.64 +/- 0.90, and 3.27 +/- 0.83 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. RESULTS: The honey mouthrinse effectively inhibited the six tested microorganisms. The chlorhexidine gluconate rinse had the lowest MICs compared with honey and saline rinses for all test species examined. The in vivo results revealed that plaque formation was inhibited/reduced by chlorhexidine and honey rinses. CONCLUSION: Honey has antibacterial action against tested oral microorganisms and also has antiplaque action.
TI  - Necrotizing periodontal diseases in HIV-infected Brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From a pool of 1,232 HIV-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. Subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. The presence and levels of 47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: All 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. Thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). Regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). The frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. Species detected in high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included Treponema denticola, Eikenella corrodens, Dialister pneumosintes, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus intermedius, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter rectus. In contrast, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium nodatum, and Helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. CONCLUSION: Necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in HIV-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular T denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as E faecalis and D pneumosintes. In addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and AIDS-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.
TI  - A five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study we used 385 K NimbleGene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis). Array hybridization was done with cDNA from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. Single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. These probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude the whole genes from the analysis. Between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. The influence of Streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on S. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. Phenotypically, under the influence of S. mitis an increase in S. mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media pH-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. Employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 S. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a S. mutans mono-species biofilm. Several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. It may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.
TI  - The subgingival microbiota of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little information about the microbiologic profiles of periodontal lesions in Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) and the significance of bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontitis in these patients. This comprehensive analysis of the subgingival microbiota in patients with PLS used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) clonal analysis and the 16S rRNA-based Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: Thirteen patients with PLS from seven unrelated families volunteered for this microbiologic study. Subgingival plaque was collected with sterile paper points from multiple sites with >/=5 mm probing depth, and whole genomic DNA was extracted. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The samples were then probed for approximately 300 predominant oral bacterial species using the HOMIM. RESULTS: The most commonly detected phylotypes in the clonal analysis were Gemella morbillorum, Gemella haemolysans, Granulicatella adiacens, Lachnospiraceae OT 100 (EI074), Parvimonas micra, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. As a group, streptococci were commonly detected in these individuals. In the HOMIM analysis, a total of 170 bacterial species/phylotypes were detected, with a range of 40 to 80 species per patient with PLS. Of these, 12 bacterial species were detected in medium to high levels in >/=50% of the individuals. The high-frequency strains were clustered into eight groups: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter spp., Capnocytophaga granulosa, G. morbillorum, P. micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Streptococcus spp., and Tannerella forsythia. CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival microbiota in PLS is diverse. Periodontal pathogens commonly associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis and opportunistic pathogens may be associated with the development of severe periodontitis in patients with PLS.
TI  - In vitro effect of photodynamic therapy on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  and Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - New periodontal disease treatments are needed to prevent infection progression. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one of the greatest pledges for this purpose. It involves the use of light of specific wavelength to activate a nontoxic photosensitizing agent in the presence of oxygen for eradication of target cells, and can be used for photokilling of microorganisms. This study evaluated in vitro the photodynamic effect of 0.01% toluidine blue-O (TBO) in combination with an AlGaInP diode laser light source on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) and Streptococcus sanguinis (S.s.). Suspensions (2 mL) containing A.a. and S.s. at 1.5 x 108 CFU/mL concentration were prepared and divided into 3 groups: Control group (no treatment), Dye group (inoculum and TBO for 5 min) and Dye/Laser group (inoculum, TBO for 5 min and laser for 3 min). Next, a dilution for subsequent subculture in 20 mL of Trypic Soy Agar (A.a) and Brucella Agar (S.s.) in Petri dishes (Pourplate Method) was done. Incubation of A.a. in microaerophilia and S.s. in aerobiosis at 35oC for 48 h was performed for subsequent visual counting of CFU/mL. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test at 5% significance level. For both strains, the control group showed a significantly higher (p<0.05) bacterial growth (1.5 x 108 CFU/mL), while the Dye group presented no significant reduction (p>0.05) in the CFU counts. The Dye/Laser group presented a significant decrease in the CFU counts (p<0.05) compared with the Control group (61.53% for A.a. and 84.32% for S.s.). It may be concluded that PDT was effective in reducing the numbers of A.a. and S.s. in vitro.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  - Isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. Compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella intermedia. In contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. Neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus). Furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward P. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. Finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was much higher when compared to 2. The activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65 and activator protein-1 (AP-1) associated with the LPS-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of silver-platinum coating for orthodontic appliances.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a hard coating for stainless surfaces based on silver (Ag)-platinum (Pt) alloys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ag-Pt alloys, which have high degree of biocompatibility, excellent resistance to sterilization conditions, and antibacterial properties to different bacteria, are associated with long-term antibacterial efficiency. Approximately 1.03-microm to 2.34-microm-thick coatings, as determined by scanning electron microscopy, were deposited on stainless surfaces by the simultaneous vaporization of both metals (Ag and Pt) in an inert argon atmosphere. The coating was done by physical vapor deposition. Microorganisms and eukaryotic culture cells were grown on these surfaces. RESULTS: The coatings released sufficient Ag ions when immersed in phosphate-buffered saline and showed significant antimicrobial potency against Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains. At the same time, human gingival fibroblast cells were not adversely affected. CONCLUSION: Ag-Pt coatings on load-bearing orthodontic bracket surfaces can provide suitable antimicrobial activity during active orthodontic treatment.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Live/dead real-time polymerase chain reaction to assess new therapies against dental plaque-related pathologies.
AB  - DNA-based methodology for the identification and detection of specific bacteria in dental plaque offers advantages over culturing techniques. One drawback of current molecular techniques like real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) is that they are not able to distinguish between live or dead bacteria. To overcome this problem an assay was assessed to discriminate between viable or dead bacteria using DNA intercalating substances, propidium monoazide (PMA) and ethidium monoazide (EMA) in combination with RT-QPCR. The assay was tested on oral pathogens: Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. To determine the effectiveness of EMA and PMA, different concentrations (from 5 to 100 mug ml(-1)) of the substances were added to viable or heat-killed suspensions of both organisms (ranging from 10(8) to 10(4) colony-forming units ml(-1)). Afterwards, PMA was tested on mixtures of varying ratios of viable and dead cells. After DNA extraction, RT-QPCR was performed using species-specific primers. Both compounds inhibited PCR amplification from dead cells. The EMA treatment resulted in the largest signal decrease but EMA also inhibited DNA amplification from viable cells. For this reason, PMA was selected for use in further experiments. It was shown to be efficient in allowing selective PCR detection of only viable cells in mixtures containing both viable and dead cells. The amount of amplified DNA corresponded to the percentage of viable cells in the sample. The developed assay will potentially be useful for assessing bacterial loads remaining after disinfection protocols without interference by non-viable bacteria.
TI  - [Analysis of the inhibitory capacity against bacterial growth of several materials of dental use. Preliminar].
AB  - Dental plaque is one of the reasons for odontogenic infection. Although multiple  bacteria are involved in these processes, A.actinomycetemcomitans and S.mutans are considered directly responsible for localized aggressive periodontitis and caries respectively. On the other hand, it seems clear that the oral flora utilizes especially not well polished surfaces or without bacteriastatic capacity in order to obtain better adhesion. Based on those facts we expect to prove the inhibitory capacity "in vitro" of some materials used for teeth restoration and for the cementation of accessories against one common bacterium in the human flora and two pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity. We prepared, following the manufacturer's instructions, 18 discs for each one of the materials used in the study (2 composites and 2 ionomeros of glass). 6 discs of each material are incubated with A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. mutans and E. coli. 3 of them are incubated directly on the discs and the other 3 are incubated previously in an artificial saliva for 24 days. From the results, should be highlighted that only one of the materials demonstrated inhibitory capacity against A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. coli. None of them demonstrated inhibitory capacity against S. mutans.
TI  - Antimicrobial sesquiterpenoids from Laurus nobilis L.
AB  - Activity-guided fractionations of leaf extracts from Laurus nobilis L. led to the isolation of a known sesquiterpene lactone, deacetyl laurenobiolide (1). Compound 1 showed antimicrobial activity against periopathic pathogens (Actinomyces viscosus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus). Furthermore, acetylation and cyclisation of deacetyl laurenobiolide (1) yielded laurenobiolide (2) and a new compound, (5S,6R,7S,8S,10R)-6,8-dihydroxyeudesma-4(15),11(13)-dien-12-oic acid 12,8-lactone (3), respectively. Compounds 2 and 3 also showed antimicrobial activities. All compounds 1-3 demonstrated growth inhibitory effects with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 31 to 1000 microg mL(-1). This is the first report of compounds 1-3 showing antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  - Inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. The present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. In particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia enterocolitica, Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter rodentium, Clostridium species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.
TI  - The pathogenic persona of community-associated oral streptococci.
AB  - The mitis group streptococci (MGS) are widespread in the oral cavity and are traditionally associated with oral health. However, these organisms have many attributes that contribute to the development of pathogenic oral communities. MGS adhere rapidly to saliva-coated tooth surfaces, thereby providing an attachment substratum for more overtly pathogenic organisms such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, and the two species assemble into heterotypic communities. Close physical association facilitates physiologic support, and pathogens such as Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans display resource partitioning to favour carbon sources generated by streptococcal metabolism. MGS exchange information with community members through a number of interspecies signalling systems including AI-2 and contact dependent mechanisms. Signal transduction systems induced in P. gingivalis are based on protein dephosphorylation mediated by the tyrosine phosphatase Ltp1, and converge on a LuxR-family transcriptional regulator, CdhR. Phenotypic responses in P. gingivalis include regulation of hemin uptake systems and gingipain activity, processes that are intimately linked to the virulence of the organism. Furthermore, communities of S. gordonii with P. gingivalis or with A. actinomycetemcomitans are more pathogenic in animal models than the constituent species alone. We propose that MGS should be considered accessory pathogens, organisms whose pathogenic potential only becomes evident in the context of a heterotypic microbial community.
TI  - Garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  - Garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. Allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. This study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. Allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. The broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, and Actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/mL or higher. Planktonic growth of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/mL. Porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/mL). Gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate N(alpha)-benzoyl-L-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of P. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. A gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/mL), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. Live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to S. mutans grown in mature biofilms. However, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. In conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial compounds from Siraitia grosvenorii leaves.
AB  - Luo Han Guo (LHG) fruits (Siraitia grosvenorii Swingle) have been used as traditional medicine in China for centuries to treat sore throats and coughs. However, LHG leaves are seldom used and minimal scientific information is available on them. In our recent study on the leaves of S. grosvenorii, the bioactive compounds beta-amyrin (2), aloe emodin (5), aloe-emodin acetate (6), 5alpha,8alpha-epidioxy-24(R)-methylcholesta-6,22-dien-3beta-ol (7) and p-hydroxyl benzyl acid (8), accompanied by n-hexadecaoic acid (1), 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (3), beta-sitosterol (4) and daucosterol (9) were first obtained. Their structures have been identified on the basis of spectroscopic studies. The activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro against the growth of oral bacterial species Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and the yeast Candida albicans, and their minimum inhibition concentrations were determined. Furthermore, the activity against S. mutans is likely to be due to the inhibition of glucosyltransferase. The experimental data provide important information on bioactive phytochemicals in the leaf of S. grosvenorii, which shows that the leaf can be a new resource as an antibacterial agent.
TI  - Interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  - Primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. Multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. Multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum or Streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. Porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; A. actinomycetemcomitans and F. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas S. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. None of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. P. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. However, A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6 and IL-8 secretion; and F. nucleatum stimulated production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum and S. gordonii, but not P. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. The results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. In addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  - The interaction between Lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. This study examined the effects of L. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of Streptococcus mutans biofilms. Human-derived L. reuteri strains (KCTC 3594 and KCTC 3678) and rat-derived L. reuteri KCTC 3679 were used. All strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of S. mutans biofilms. These antibacterial activities of L. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. Reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by L. reuteri KCTC 3594. In addition, L. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis. Overall, these results suggest that L. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.
TI  - Spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  - PURPOSE: The occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the United States. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. In vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. RESULTS: A total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. Spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of Fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), Parvimonas micra (10.8%), Streptococcus constellatus (10%), Streptococcus intermedius (10%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and Tannerella forsythia (5.3%). Amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in P. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), T. forsythia (15.8%), S. constellatus (10%), F. nucleatum (5.6%), and P. micra (2.7%). Only S. constellatus (70%) and S. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. When subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each of S. constellatus and S. intermedius from one study subject. Similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except S. constellatus in one subject. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of United States origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival F. nucleatum species. In vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial efficacy in non-Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Selective killing of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans by ciprofloxacin during development of a dual species biofilm with Streptococcus sanguinis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Periodontal disease is associated with a pathogen-induced transition  to a chronic destructive inflammatory response. Since commensals may either passively or actively contribute to immune homeostasis, therapies aimed at selectively reducing the competitive advantage of pathogens may be effective supplements to traditional methods. We developed an in vitro system to grow biofilms composed of the pathogen (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) and the commensal (Streptococcus sanguinis). We used the biofilm model to determine the feasibility of selectively killing the pathogen using the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin. DESIGN: Biofilms were exposed to relevant ciprofloxacin doses during the first 24h of development, with subsequent removal of the ciprofloxacin for a 24h period. Biofilm growth was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, crystal violet staining and DNA abundance. RESULTS: Exposure to 0.01mg/L or 0.5mg/L ciprofloxacin significantly reduced the microcolony size and cell surface density of A. actinomycetemcomitans in the dual species biofilm over a 24h period whilst allowing uninhibited S. sanguinis biofilm formation. A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm development was insignificant over a subsequent 24h period after removal of the ciprofloxacin indicating that A. actinomycetemcomitans cells were killed. CONCLUSIONS: A. actinomycetemcomitans residing in a dual species biofilm with the commensal, S. sanguinis can be selectively killed, or at least rendered metabolically inactive, by treatment with ciprofloxacin. The dual species biofilm model will be a useful tool for designing in vivo studies to determine the efficacy of selective killing agents as an adjunct treatment of localized aggressive forms of periodontal disease.
TI  - Influence of topography and hydrophilicity on initial oral biofilm formation on microstructured titanium surfaces in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of the microtopography and hydrophilicity of titanium (Ti) substrates on initial oral biofilm formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine bacterial species belonging to the normal oral microbiota, including: Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces israelii, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus sanguinis were tested on Ti surfaces: pretreatment (PT [R(a) <0.2 mum]), acid-etched (A [R(a) <0.8 mum]), A modified to be hydrophilic (modA), sand-blasted/acid-etched (SLA [R(a) =4 mum]), and hydrophilic SLA (modSLA). Disks were incubated for 24 h in anaerobic conditions using a normal culture medium (CM) or human saliva (HS). The total counts of bacteria and the proportion of each bacterial species were analysed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: Higher counts of bacteria were observed on all surfaces incubated with CM compared with the samples incubated with HS. PT, SLA, and modSLA exhibited higher numbers of attached bacteria in CM, whereas SLA and modSLA had a significant increase in bacterial adhesion in HS. The proportion of the species in the initial biofilms was also influenced by the surface properties and the media used: SLA and modSLA increased the proportion of species like A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sanguinis in both media, while the adhesion of A. israelii and P. gingivalis on the same surfaces was affected in the presence of saliva. CONCLUSIONS: The initial biofilm formation and composition were affected by the microtopography and hydrophilicity of the surface and by the media used.
TI  - Multispecies communities: interspecies interactions influence growth on saliva as sole nutritional source.
AB  - Human oral bacteria live in multispecies communities in the biofilm called dental plaque. This review focuses on the interactions of seven species and the ability of each species individually and together with other species to grow on saliva as the sole source of nutrient. Community formation in biofilms in flow cells is monitored using species-specific fluorophore-conjugated immunoglobulin G, and images are captured by confocal microscopy. Early colonizing veillonellae emerge from this review of interspecies interactions in saliva as a critical genus that guides the development of multispecies communities. Highly selective interspecies recognition is evident as initial colonizers pair with early and middle colonizers to form multispecies communities that grow on saliva.
TI  - Metabolite cross-feeding enhances virulence in a model polymicrobial infection.
AB  - Microbes within polymicrobial infections often display synergistic interactions resulting in enhanced pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions are not well understood. Development of model systems that allow detailed mechanistic studies of polymicrobial synergy is a critical step towards a comprehensive understanding of these infections in vivo. In this study, we used a model polymicrobial infection including the opportunistic pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and the commensal Streptococcus gordonii to examine the importance of metabolite cross-feeding for establishing co-culture infections. Our results reveal that co-culture with S. gordonii enhances the pathogenesis of A. actinomycetemcomitans in a murine abscess model of infection. Interestingly, the ability of A. actinomycetemcomitans to utilize L-lactate as an energy source is essential for these co-culture benefits. Surprisingly, inactivation of L-lactate catabolism had no impact on mono-culture growth in vitro and in vivo suggesting that A. actinomycetemcomitans L-lactate catabolism is only critical for establishing co-culture infections. These results demonstrate that metabolite cross-feeding is critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans to persist in a polymicrobial infection with S. gordonii supporting the idea that the metabolic properties of commensal bacteria alter the course of pathogenesis in polymicrobial communities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bifidobacterium spp. isolated from healthy adult Koreans against cariogenic microflora.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dental caries is the main common infectious disease in the human oral  cavity. Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus were reported to be the most important etiological factors in human dental caries. Thus, we examined the inhibitory effects of Bifidobacterium spp. cells and culture supernatants against S. mutans and S. sobrinus, including Streptococcus gordonii, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with periodontal disease. METHODS: Mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were mixed in 1:1 ratio and then incubated for 90 min at 37 degrees C. After the incubation, the viability of mutans streptococci or A. actinomycetemcomitans was determined by plate count technique. We also investigated the morphological changes of S. mutans treated with LAB using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RESULTS: In vitro viability of S. mutans, S. sobrinus, S. gordonii, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was affected by human intestinal LAB identified as Bifidobacterium adolescentis SPM1005 and Bifidobacterium longum SPM1207. Especially, B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells at 1.0 x 10(8) CFU had a strong growth-inhibiting effect against S. mutans and induced a 64% loss of its viability (p<0.05). In addition, swollen and disrupted S. mutans were observed after incubation with B. adolescentis SPM1005. However, the culture supernatant of this strain did not show such inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: B. adolescentis SPM1005 cells decreased the growth of S. mutans, which is a risk factor for dental caries. Therefore, we suggest that this Bifidobacterium strain may be a useful probiotic microorganism for prevention of dental caries that does not have adverse effects.
TI  - Clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  - It has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. It is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. To investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. Factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for T. forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, Parvimonas micra, and Treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of A. oris, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eikenella corrodens, Streptococcus intermedius, Selenomonas noxia, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Veillonella parvula. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while Fusobacterium nucleatum loaded on both. These findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.
TI  - Prunus mume extract exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prunus mume is a common fruit in Asia, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we focused on the antimicrobial properties of Prunus mume extract against oral pathogens related to dental caries and periodontal diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 15 oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, S. sanguinis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, P. gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and Candida species were included in the study. Initially, agar diffusion assay was performed to screen the antimicrobial activities of Prunus mume extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were then determined for sensitive species. Effect of Prunus mume extract on human oral keratinocytes (HOK) viability was also tested. RESULT: In the agar diffusion assay, drug suspension of 2 g/mL was able to inhibit all the bacterial species tested, but not the fungal species. MIC and MBC range of Prunus mume extract against the oral bacteria was 0.15625-0.0003 g/mL and P. gingivalis being the most susceptible species. Prune extract did not cause any detrimental effect on HOK. CONCLUSION: Prunus mume extract may be a potential candidate for developing an oral antimicrobial agent to control or prevent dental diseases associated with oral pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (C1), acetic acid (C2), propionic acid (C3), butyric acid (C4), isobutyric acid (C4), isovaleric acid (C5), hexanoic acid (C6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (C8), capric acid (C10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (C14), palmitic acid (C16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus sanguis, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. As a group the fatty acids were much less effective against C. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. Formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. Interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. First, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. Second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. Further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.
TI  - An in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (CloSYS Oral Rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. METHODS: Oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. The numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity. RESULTS: As expected, Listerine and Crest Pro-Health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. Breath Rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. CloSYS and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, CloSYS oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that CloSYS Oral Rinse has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.
TI  - Real-time mapping of a hydrogen peroxide concentration profile across a polymicrobial bacterial biofilm using scanning electrochemical microscopy.
AB  - Quantitative detection of hydrogen peroxide in solution above a Streptococcus gordonii (Sg) bacterial biofilm was studied in real time by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was determined to be 0.7 mM to 1.6 mM in the presence of 10 mM glucose over a period of 2 to 8 h. The hydrogen peroxide production measured was higher near the biofilm surface in comparison to Sg grown planktonically. Differential hydrogen peroxide production was observed both by fluorometric as well as by SECM measurements. The interaction between two different species in a bacterial biofilm of Sg and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) in terms of hydrogen peroxide production was also studied by SECM. One-directional y-scan SECM measurements showed the unique spatial mapping of hydrogen peroxide concentration across a mixed species biofilm and revealed that hydrogen peroxide concentration varies greatly dependent upon local species composition.
TI  - Structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. The selected species represent initial (Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces naeslundii), early (Veillonella parvula), secondary (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). The structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. The biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: After 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. The intermediate colonizer F. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. Late colonizers A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. The biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. CONCLUSION: An in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial efficacy of cetylpyridinium chloride-containing mouthwashes.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the ability of three CPC-containing mouthwashes to kill planktonic bacteria in an in vitro short-exposure assay. METHODS: This blind study was conducted on two common oral bacterial species: Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans. The following mouthwashes were tested: two containing 0.075% CPC and 0.05% NaF in an alcohol-free base, and one containing 0.075% CPC and 0.05% NaF plus 6% alcohol. Additionally, a 0.05% NaF-only mouthwash was included as a negative control. Bacteria were exposed to one of the test mouthwashes for 30 seconds and then washed thoroughly, serially diluted, and plated on appropriate media to determine viable bacterial counts. Viable counts were converted to a log reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) relative to the negative control. RESULTS: All three test mouthwashes included in this study gave a statistically significant reduction of > 3 log CFUs relative to samples treated with the negative control. CONCLUSION: All three experimental 0.075% CPC mouthwash formulas gave a > 99.9% reduction in viable bacteria of both species following 30 seconds of treatment.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of polysaccharide gel extract from fruit rinds of Durio zibethinus Murr. against oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - AIM: The polysaccharide gel (PG) extract from durian fruit rinds (Durio zibethinus Murr. "Monthong") is a pectic polysaccharide with antibacterial activity. This study aimed to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of PG against oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans (S.mutans) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A.actinomycetemcomitans). METHODS: The inhibitory activity of PG at 50, 100, and 150 mg/mL against S.mutans (American Tissue Culture Collection 25175) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (American Tissue Culture Collection 43718) was determined after 1- and 5-min exposure by broth macrodilution susceptibility test and scanning electron microscopy. Normal saline or culture broth medium and 0.1% chlorhexidine were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. RESULTS: For 1-min exposure, 150 mg/mL PG or 0.1% chlorhexidine significantly possessed bactericidal activity against both tested bacteria (P=0.037), while PG at 100 mg/mL possessed significant bactericidal activity against S.mutans (P=0.037) and inhibitory activity against A.actinomycetemcomitans (P=0.05). Blebs, irregular-shaped cells, and disrupted cells were found in bacteria treated with either 0.1% chlorhexidine or 50-150mg/mL PG under scanning electron microscopy. CONCLUSION: The bactericidal activity of PG at 150 mg/mL against oral bacteria at 1-min exposure suggests its possibility to be used as a natural antibacterial ingredient in oral hygiene products.
TI  - Setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. The involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. This study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. The setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. Furthermore, it is easy to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. METHODS: Streptococcus mitis, S. salivarius and S. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, S. mutans as main carriogenic species, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, S. intermedius and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. Different liquid growth media were evaluated. Safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. Viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. FINDINGS: S. mitis, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and P. micra failed to form biofilm structures. S. mutans, S. sanguinis, S. intermedius and S. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in CDM/sucrose. A. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. For in depth analysis S. mitis, S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. Microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. Investigation of two species combinations of S. mitis with either S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: This setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. Our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted S. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.
TI  - Oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. However, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. AIM: To investigate the effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: H400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. Cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and NF-kappaB activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: Tannerella forsythensis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial NF-kappaB activation and cytokine responses. An oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest IL-8 and TNF-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.
TI  - Photolysis of hydrogen peroxide, an effective disinfection system via hydroxyl radical formation.
AB  - The relationship between the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis  of H(2)O(2) and bactericidal activity was examined. H(2)O(2) (1 M) was irradiated with laser light at a wavelength of 405 nm to generate hydroxyl radicals. Electron spin resonance spin trapping analysis showed that the amount of hydroxyl radicals produced increased with the irradiation time. Four species of pathogenic oral bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, and Enterococcus faecalis, were used in the bactericidal assay. S. mutans in a model biofilm was also examined. Laser irradiation of suspensions in 1 M H(2)O(2) resulted in a >99.99% reduction of the viable counts of each of the test species within 3 min of treatment. Treatment of S. mutans in a biofilm resulted in a >99.999% reduction of viable counts within 3 min. Other results demonstrated that the bactericidal activity was dependent on the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated. Treatment of bacteria with 200 to 300 muM hydroxyl radicals would result in reductions of viable counts of >99.99%.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as an early colonizer of oral tissues: epithelium as a reservoir?
AB  - This study examined in vivo and in vitro colonization by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an organism highly associated with aggressive periodontitis. Thirteen volunteers (5 were A. actinomycetemcomitans positive for buccal epithelial cells [BECs] and teeth, 5 were A. actinomycetemcomitans positive for teeth only, and 3 were A. actinomycetemcomitans-negative controls) had two mandibular stents fabricated. Each stent contained 3 removable hydroxyapatite (HA) tooth surrogates. One HA square was removed from a stent at 5 time points over 7 h to assess the transfer of A. actinomycetemcomitans from teeth or BECs to HA. Streptococcus, Actinomyces, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and total anaerobic counts were evaluated on each square over time. In vitro experiments evaluated binding, desorption, transfer, and reattachment of A. actinomycetemcomitans wild-type and mutant strains to BECs and saliva-coated HA (SHA). Streptococcus and Actinomyces formed 80% of the cultivable flora on HA in all subjects. Transfer of A. actinomycetemcomitans to HA was not seen in subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans on teeth only. All 5 subjects with A. actinomycetemcomitans on BECs showed transfer of A. actinomycetemcomitans to HA. In vitro, A. actinomycetemcomitans desorbed from BECs and transferred to SHA. A. actinomycetemcomitans binding to SHA was irreversible and did not transfer to BECs. The adhesin Aae showed specificity for BECs. Fimbrial mutants showed the greatest reduction in binding to SHA. A. actinomycetemcomitans migrated from BECs to HA in vivo and to SHA in vitro; however, A. actinomycetemcomitans movement from teeth and SHA to BECs did not occur. In vivo, A. actinomycetemcomitans colonized HA within 6 h and thus can be considered an early colonizer. BECs are a likely reservoir for A. actinomycetemcomitans tooth colonization.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Brazilian medicinal plant extracts against pathogenic microorganisms of interest to dentistry.
AB  - This study evaluated the susceptibility of oral pathogenic microorganisms Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to Brazilian medicinal plant extracts of Schinus terebinthifolius (aroeira), Croton campestris (velame), Lafoensia pacari (pacari), Centaurium erythraea (centaurea), Stryphnodendron adstringens (barbatimao), and Anacardium humile (cajuzinho-docerrado), as compared to standardized antimicrobial agents (nystatin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline hydrochloride). Ethanol, hexane and butane fractions from stem barks, rinds, leaves, and/or roots were extracted and tested. Antimicrobial diffusion agar test and MIC were performed according to CLSI. After 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C, the diameter of inhibition zones and spectrophotometer readings were measured and compared. The results were reported as means +/- standard deviation (M +/- SD). With the exception of five extracts that showed no antimicrobial activity, all the extracts tested showed antimicrobial activity, in different levels. This study suggests that extracts from the plants tested could be an alternative therapeutic option for infectious conditions of the oral cavity, such as denture stomatitis, dental caries, and periodontitis.
TI  - Efficacy and safety of adjunctive local moxifloxacin delivery in the treatment of periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Moxifloxacin exerts excellent antibacterial activity against most putative periodontal pathogens and has been shown to kill bacteria in biofilm and host cells. METHODS: Patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly assigned to receive a single subgingival application of a 0.125%, 0.4%, or 1.25% moxifloxacin gel or placebo gel immediately after full-mouth scaling and root planing (SRP). Clinical efficacy measurements were assessed in sites with baseline probing depth (PD) of >/=5.4 mm at 6 weeks and 3 months and any adverse events were determined. In addition, putative periodontal pathogens and resistance of subgingival bacteria against moxifloxacin were assessed. RESULTS: Data of 57 patients were included in the statistical analysis. In all treatment groups, the PD decreased from baseline to 3 months, with the greatest reduction seen in patients treated with moxifloxacin 0.4% (1.5 +/- 0.6 mm; P = 0.023 compared to placebo), followed by patients receiving moxifloxacin 1.25% (1.2 +/- 0.4), moxifloxacin 0.125% (1.1 +/- 1.1), and placebo (1.0 +/- 0.6). No linear trend for PD reduction with increasing moxifloxacin concentrations was found. Porphyromonas gingivalis showed the greatest reduction in prevalence among the assessed pathogens, without any significant intergroup differences. No correlation or systematic relationship between adverse events, including bacterial resistance against moxifloxacin, and the investigational gels was found. CONCLUSIONS: In periodontal pockets with PD of >/=5.4 mm, a single subgingival administration of a 0.4% moxifloxacin gel as an adjunct to SRP may result in additional PD reduction compared to SRP alone. In addition, the investigated moxifloxacin gels seem to be safe.
TI  - Characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and radiographic parameters were recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. Partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). Microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. Predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythensis, Treponema denticola, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. RESULTS: In all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. The frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (A actino?mycetemcomitans, P gingivalis, T forsythensis, T denticola) was significantly higher around natural teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. In contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. In partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.
TI  - [Study on the counting of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium colorimetric method].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility of methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetric method and the applied condition for the normal bacteria in the mouth, as Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus sanguis (S. sanguis), Haemophilus actinomycetemcomitans (H. actinomycetemcomitans). METHODS: Colony forming units (CFU) which was the standard antitheses was used to count bacteria. This study would gain some parameters by changing wavelength, reactive time, dosage and so on. MTT colorimetric method was applied in the counting of S. mutans, S. sanguis and H. actinomycetemcomitans. RESULTS: When counting S. mutans, the best wavelength was 510 nm, the best range was 1.5 x 10(5) - 1.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). When counting S. sanguis, the best wavelength was 545 nm, the best range was 1.5 x 10(5) - 2.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). When counting H. actinomycetemcomitans, the best wavelength was 557 nm, the best range was 1.0 x 10(6) - 5.0 x 10(7) CFU x mL(-1). MTT colorimetric method can be used for different aged S. mutans, S. sanguis and H. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: Oral bacteria could be counted by MTT colorimetric method, which is fast and convenient.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of n-6, n-7 and n-9 fatty acids and their esters for oral  microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is to assess the antibacterial activity of omega-6, -7, -9  (n-6, n-7, n-9) fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. METHODS: The n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids, such as gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (ARA), palmitoleic acid (PA), and oleic acid (OA), their fatty acid ethyl esters, GLA-EE, LA-EE, ARA-EE, PA-EE, OA-EE, and their fatty acid methyl esters, GLA-ME, LA-ME, ARA-ME, PA-ME, OA-ME, were investigated for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Various concentrations of the fatty acids, their methyl and ethyl esters were tested against various oral pathogens in 96-well plates and blood-agar plate. The plates were incubated anaerobically or aerobically at 37 degrees C for 48h, and the colony forming units (CFU) were determined. RESULTS: The data demonstrated that select n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and their esters exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against these oral microorganisms, demonstrating some specificity for individual microbial species. CONCLUSION: The potential use or the combinations of the n-6, n-7, n-9 fatty acids and/or their esters, provided in a local delivery vehicle to infected sites in the oral cavity, could be considered as an additional therapeutic approach to improving oral health.
TI  - Effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  - We report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. Fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (H(2)S >1.5 or CH(3)SH >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. Either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. Mouth air was monitored for VSC levels at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. Whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. At 10 min, the level of CH(3)SH was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; P = 0.011). The median concentration of CH(3)SH in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2 h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. No difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative PCR, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; P = 0.033). These results indicate a suppressive effect of the test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans accelerates atherosclerosis with an increase in atherogenic factors in spontaneously hyperlipidemic mice.
AB  - Cariogenic and periodontal pathogens are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. We assessed the involvement of the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and cariogenic pathogen Streptococcus mutans in the development of atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient spontaneously hyperlipidemic (Apoe(shl)) mice. The mice were treated intravenously with A. actinomycetemcomitans HK1651, S. mutans GS-5, or phosphate-buffered saline three times a week for 3 weeks and killed at 15 weeks of age. The areas of the aortic sinus that were covered with atherosclerotic plaque were significantly larger in Apoe(shl) mice challenged with A. actinomycetemcomitans compared with S. mutans- or vehicle-challenged mice. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans challenge increased serum high-sensitive C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharide levels. Bacterial DNA was detected in the blood, heart, and spleen, but not in the liver. Furthermore, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and MCP-1 levels and Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, ICAM-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, LOX-1, HSP60, CCL19, CCL21, CCR7, and MCP-1 expressions in the aorta were significantly increased in mice challenged with A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that systemic infection with A. actinomycetemcomitans accelerates atherosclerosis in Apoe(shl) mice by exposing the whole microorganisms or their products, followed by initiating inflammation. Increases in proatherogenic factors may explain the aggravation of atherosclerosis by A. actinomycetemcomitans infection.
TI  - PCR detection of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in dental plaque samples from Haitian adolescents.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis, respectively. The aim of this study was to determine the colonization of these two microorganisms in the dental plaque of a group of Haitian adolescents using two different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods, standard PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays. Fifty-four pooled supra-gingival plaque samples and 98 pooled sub-gingival plaque samples were obtained from 104 12- to19-year-old rural-dwelling Haitians. The total genomic DNA of bacteria was isolated from these samples, and all participants also received caries and periodontal examinations. Caries prevalence was 42.2%, and the mean decayed, missing, and filled surface (DMFS) was 2.67 +/- 5.3. More than half of the adolescents (53.3%) experienced periodontal pockets (Community Periodontal Index score >/=3). S. mutans was detected in 67.3% by qPCR and 38.8% by PCR of the supra-gingival plaque samples (p < 0.01), and 36.6% by qPCR and 8.1% by PCR of the sub-gingival samples (p < 0.01). A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 85.1% by qPCR and 44.0% by PCR of the sub-gingival samples (p < 0.01), but the prevalence was similar, 67.3% by qPCR and 59.2% by PCR, in the supra-gingival plaque samples. Neither age nor gender was significantly correlated to the bacterial colonization. The results demonstrated a moderate-to-high prevalence of S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans in the Haitian adolescent population, and qPCR is more sensitive than standard PCR in field conditions. These findings suggest that qPCR should be considered for field oral epidemiologic studies and may be necessary in investigations having major logistic challenges.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidised water against oral microorganisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The radical anion of oxygen (O(-)) is extremely oxidative and shows high reactivity. In this study, the antibacterial activity of water super-oxidised water containing high concentration of O(-) (O(-)-water) was tested against cultured planktonic cells of cariogenic bacteria, periodontopathic bacteria and Candida albicans. METHODS: O(-)-water was prepared using the AOE-750 (Oxy Japan Corporation, Japan) and its antibacterial activity against pure culture of Streptococcus sobrinus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and C. albicans evaluated. Each oral microorganism (10(4) to 10(8)CFU/ml) was exposed to three concentrations of O(-)-water at room temperature or 37 degrees C for 15s to 24h. RESULTS: Exposure to O(-)-water resulted in a bactericidal effect against all cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria tested. No significant fungicidal effect was observed on C. albicans, however. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that O(-)-water exerts an antibacterial effect on cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Boesenbergia pandurata and Piper sarmentosum leaf extracts on planktonic cells and biofilm of oral pathogens.
AB  - Increasing awareness of hazards associated with the use of antibiotic and chemical agents has accelerated investigations into plants and their extracts as new sources of antimicrobial agents. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effects of oil and 95% ethanol extracts of Boesenbergia pandurata rhizomes and Piper sarmentosum leaf against four oral pathogens which were Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Candida albicans. Employing the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods, the results showed that B. pandurata oil (BPO) was the most effective extract against C. albicans. Time-kill assay with the BPO demonstrated killing of C. albicans at concentrations equal to 2 and 2.5 times the MIC. The times required to reach the fungicidal endpoint at 2 and 2.5 times the MIC were 60 and 44 min, respectively. In addition, our results also demonstrated that the BPO possesses potent anti-Candida biofilm activity in vitro. Therefore, the BPO could be considered as a natural antifungal agent against Candida infections and has significant potential for further investigation.
TI  - Profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microflora from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with periodontitis using quantitative real-time PCR.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Qualitative and quantitative changes of the subgingival plaque biofilm microflora in periodontal pockets are thought to be associated with the development and progression of periodontitis. The aims of the present study were to quantify the proportions of nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species and four Streptococcus species in subgingival plaque, and to evaluate their relationship with periodontitis quantitatively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from 12 periodontally healthy subjects and from 28 patients with periodontitis. The amounts of total and target bacteria were measured by quantitative real-time PCR using universal and species-specific primers, respectively. RESULTS: The proportion of total obligate anaerobes was found to be higher in subjects with periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.05). Among obligate anaerobes, Tannerella forsythia (2.04 +/- 5.27%, p < 0.05), Porphyromonas gingivalis (0.54 +/- 1.41%) and Eubacterium saphenum (0.30 +/- 0.96%) were detected at high proportions in subjects with periodontitis, but not in periodontally healthy subjects. By contrast, the proportion of total streptococci was lower in subjects with periodontitis (p < 0.05). Specifically, the proportion of T. forsythia, P. gingivalis or E. saphenum increased (>or= 2.78%) and the proportion of Streptococcus species decreased to virtually undetectable levels, in subjects with periodontitis. CONCLUSION: Obligate anaerobes, including T. forthysia, P. gingivalis and E. saphenum, were identified predominantly in microflora from subjects with periodontitis, whereas Streptococcus species were identified predominantly in microflora from periodontally healthy subjects, suggesting a change in the subgingival environment that resulted in conditions more suitable for the survival of obligate anaerobes. The proportion of these obligate anaerobes in the subgingival plaque of subjects with periodontitis appears to be associated with the status of human periodontitis.
TI  - A novel bioactivity of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their ester derivatives.
AB  - Fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. While n-3 PUFA have been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. The n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, ALAEE, EPAEE, DHAEE were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. This study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three major n-3 PUFA, EPA, DHA, and ALA, and their ester derivatives. Our experimental data indicated that n-3 PUFA and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including Streptococcus mutans, Candida albicans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. This study suggested that n-3 PUFA could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.
TI  - Periodontitis, periodontopathic bacteria and lactoferrin.
AB  - Lactoferrin (LF) is a component of saliva and is suspected to be a defense factor against oral pathogens including Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. Periodontitis is a very common oral disease caused by periodontopathic bacteria. Antimicrobial activities and other biological effects of LF against representative periodontopathic bacteria, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia, have been widely studied. Association of polymorphisms in LF with incidence of aggressive periodontitis and the role of LF in the gingival crevicular fluid as a marker of periodontitis severity have also been reported. Periodontopathic bacteria reside as a biofilm in supragingival and subgingival plaque. Our recent study indicated that LF exhibits antibacterial activity against planktonic forms of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia at higher concentrations, and furthermore, LF effectively inhibits biofilm formation and reduces the established biofilm of these bacteria at physiological concentrations. A small-scale clinical study indicated that oral administration of bovine LF reduces P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in the subgingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients. LF seems to be a biofilm inhibitor of periodontopathic bacteria in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Central role of the early colonizer Veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. Bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. Lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. We investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. Fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. Of six species tested, only the initial colonizer Actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. The initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. The early colonizer Veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. The biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when Veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. All three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., A. oris, Veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer Porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. Further specificity was seen when Fusobacterium nucleatum (a middle colonizer), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and P. gingivalis did not grow with S. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of Veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. We propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.
TI  - Epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  - AIM: The dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. Human gingival epithelial cells (HGECs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. The aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 secretion induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HGECs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Primary HGECs challenged with live P. gingivalis produced high levels of IL-1beta, while challenge with live A. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of IL-8. The opportunistic pathogen F. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal S. gordonii is the least stimulatory. CONCLUSION: We conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria induce different cytokine response profiles in primary HGECs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.
TI  - [Bacteriological spectrum of periodontal pocket in patients with coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the last years literature has paid attention to positive correlation between periodontitis and coronary heart disease, acute coronary events, including myocardial infarction. Mechanisms of this relationship are not completely known. One of the research trends for elucidation of these problems are bacteriological studies. The aim of this study was qualitative and quantitative evaluation of bacterial flora of the periodontal pocket in patients with coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction, with co-existing periodontitis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The research included 40 patients, hospitalised in 1st Clinic of Cardiology, Medical University in Gdansk. Group 1 included 20 patients after myocardial infarction, group 2 of 20 patients with diagnosed coronary heart disease, with many years duration without acute events. Control group encompassed 20 patients of Chair and Department of Periodontology and Oral Mucosa Diseases, Medical University in Gdansk, without cardiovascular diseases. Inclusion criterion for the study was diagnosed chronic periodontitis in all patients. In clinical evaluation indices: API, SBI, PD and CAL were used. The material for bacteriological research was taken in each patient from 4 periodontal pockets, minimum 5 mm depth. The culture and identification were performed with present principles. Based on the litearture data about potential pathogenicity for periodontium and cardiovascular system, species for analyse were chosen. RESULTS: Statistical analyse proved equality of evaluated groups and control group in gender, age and estimated clinical indices. In periodontal pockets all patients anaerobic flora dominated, however without significiant differences in species range. Among microaerophilia and streptococci statistical analyse showed significiant differences in frequency of isolation of Actinobacillus actinomycetescomitans and Streptococcus sanguis in group 1 in comparision to group 2 and control group. Quantitative analyse showed no significiant differences between groups for all bacteria species. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical evaluation showed comparable values of periodontal parameters. The bacteria species Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetescomitans and Streptococcus sanguis were more often isolated from periodontal pockets in persons after myocardial infarction, statistically significant for A.a. and S.s.
TI  - Microbial profile of ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the biofilm accumulated around ligatures in rats by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using probes made from human oral bacterial species. METHODS: 12 Wistar rats were selected for this study. One of the mandibular first molars of each animal received a ligature, while the contralateral tooth was left unligated to be used as a control. Forty-two days later, the ligatures and one sample of biofilm from each unligated teeth were analyzed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 human periodontal species. The area of bone loss in the furcation area was determined histometrically. RESULTS: The unligated teeth did not present any of the bacterial species tested. Twenty five species were detected in the ligatures. Streptococcus- and Actinomyces-like species were found in high mean counts, followed by Fusobacterium-, Prevotella nigrescens- and Parvimonas micra-like species and Porphyromonas gingivalis- and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-like species. Greater bone loss was observed in the furcation area of the ligated than of the unligated group (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: At 42 days, the ligature biofilm in rats presents various bacterial species that hybridize to probes of periodontal bacterial species commonly observed in human.
TI  - Clinical status and detection of periodontopathogens and Streptococcus mutans in  children with high levels of supragingival biofilm.
AB  - Knowledge about the presence of some important oral pathogens is an important step in better identifying children at risk for periodontal and/or caries diseases in later life. The purpose of this study was to detect the presence of Streptococcus mutans (Sm), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Campylobacter rectus (Cr), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), and Tannerella forsythia (Tf) in gingival biofilm samples from 196 children, and to assess whether any of these pathogens are more associated with gingival inflammation extension and the Decayed/Missing/Filled teeth (DMFT/dmft) index. The subjects presented plaque index greater than 80% and were divided in 3 groups according to the bleeding index (BI): I) Low bleeding (< 30%), II) Medium bleeding (31 - 59%) and III) High bleeding (> 60%). The presence of each pathogen was determined by PCR. The prevalence of Sm was 71.9% and the mean dmft/DMFT was 6.68. The prevalence in low, medium and high bleeding groups was 43.5%, 34.5% and 46.7% for Aa; 43.5%, 37.9%, and 36.7% for Cr; 99.1%, 100%, and 96.7% for Pg; 56.5%, 56.9%, and 66.7% for Pi; and 58.3%, 60.3%, and 56.7% for Tf, respectively. Pg (99.0%) was the most prevalent periodontal pathogen detected followed by Tf (58.7%), Pi (58.2%), Aa (41.3%) and Cr (40.8%). Our study indicated that in this high plaque index population studied, a high prevalence of Sm and high mean DMFT were observed. In addition, the presence of Pi was associated with the presence of inflammation (P < 0.05) whereas Cr was associated with periodontal health (P < 0.05).
TI  - Microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  - The inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. Bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. It was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. In this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by human cells were investigated. The beneficial species, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the IL-8 production triggered by A. actinomycetemcomitans. The inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. In contrast, the commensal Streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen Fusobacterium nucleatum increased IL-8 production by the host cells. These results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Micro-organism and cell viability on antimicrobially modified titanium.
AB  - When titanium is anodized by discharge in NaCl solution, both antimicrobial activity and osteoconductivity are conferred. The viability of adherent micro-organisms and cells on antimicrobial titanium remains uncertain. We hypothesized that a thin peroxidation barrier would efficiently destroy adherent bacteria, whereas adherent osteoblastic cells would be viable, since these cells adhere to the surface indirectly though serum proteins. The efficacy of antimicrobial titanium appears to be based on peroxidation, since peroxidation products were detected in parallel with the destruction of bacterial cell-surface structures. The peroxidation effect of antimicrobial titanium was confined to the surface within narrow limits. The viability of osteoblastic cells on the surface was strongly dependent on the presence of serum protein, whereas that of adherent Streptococcus mutans was not affected by the presence of serum proteins. Therefore, differences in the adherent systems used by bacteria and osteoblastic cells are important determinants of their viability on antimicrobial titanium.
TI  - Mutualistic biofilm communities develop with Porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. We report here that P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. Integration of P. gingivalis into multispecies communities was investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. In flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using species-specific primers. P. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer Streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinomyces oris, as well as with Veillonella sp. (early colonizer), Fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). In three-species flow cells, P. gingivalis grew with Veillonella sp. and A. actinomycetemcomitans but not with S. oralis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. Also, it grew with Veillonella sp. and F. nucleatum but not with S. oralis and F. nucleatum, indicating that P. gingivalis and S. oralis are not compatible. However, P. gingivalis grew in combination with S. gordonii and S. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. Collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of P. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.
TI  - Bacterial penetration through antibiotic-loaded guided tissue regeneration membranes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared bacterial penetration through guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membranes impregnated with antibiotics. METHODS: Three barrier membranes, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) membrane, collagen membrane, and glycolide fiber composite membrane, were loaded with amoxicillin or tetracycline. The penetration of Streptococcus mutans and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) through the GTR membranes was achieved using a device consisting of an inner tube and an outer bottle filled with culture media. RESULTS: The penetration of S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans into the inner tubes significantly decreased with all of the antibiotic-loaded membranes compared to membranes without antibiotics. However, differences were found in the behavior of the three membranes. The antibiotic-loaded ePTFE membranes showed the best barrier effect. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on S. mutans was greater than that of amoxicillin for all GTR membranes. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on A. actinomycetemcomitans was lower than that of amoxicillin with the glycolide fiber membrane. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that penetration of S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans through amoxicillin- or tetracycline-loaded ePTFE membrane, glycolide fiber membrane, and collagen membrane was delayed and/or reduced. Thus, incorporation of an antibiotic into the membrane may be of value when controlling membrane-associated infection during GTR therapy.
TI  - Oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can integrate into T cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. Reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger HIV reactivation leading to HIV recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active antiretroviral therapies. METHODS: This study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate HIV promoter activation in various cell models of HIV latency. RESULTS: T cells (1G5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of HIV promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. Direct bacterial challenge of the T cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. Challenge of macrophages (BF24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except Streptococcus mutans. Dendritic cells showed increases in HIV reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate HIV from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = T cells. Expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.
TI  - Interference with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans: colonization of epithelial cells under hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered to be important for bacterial colonization. Interactions that inhibit colonization of pathogens could possibly be used as a new treatment approach for periodontitis. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis on soft surfaces in vitro, taking into account the hydrodynamic forces continuously present in vivo. METHODS: Cultured epithelial cells were precolonized with Streptococcus sanguinis KTH-4, Streptococcus cristatus CC5A, Streptococcus salivarius TOVE and Streptococcus mitis BMS before Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans colonization. Experiments were performed in a modified Robbins-device-type flow cell. Bacterial colonization and the number of epithelial cells were evaluated by microbial culturing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The streptococci were able to inhibit A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization on soft tissue surfaces under flow conditions. Statistically significant differences were found between streptococcal pretreatments and the controls, with the most pronounced effect caused by S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These data confirm the possibility of applying beneficial bacteria in periodontal treatment.
TI  - A quinol peroxidase inhibitor prevents secretion of a leukotoxin from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Quinol peroxidase (QPO) catalyzes peroxidase activity using quinol in the respiratory chain as a substrate. Quinol peroxidase is essential for the secretion of leukotoxin (LtxA), which destroys leukocytes and erythrocytes in humans and is one of the major virulence factors of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, which is associated with localized aggressive periodontitis. In the present study, we aimed to find a highly potent QPO inhibitor to attenuate the virulence of A. actinomycetemcomitans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For screening of QPO inhibitors, QPO activity was measured kinetically by SpectraMax Plus with 96-well UV plates. Three hundred compounds in the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences Chemical Library were screened. Secretion of LtxA in the culture supernatant was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cytotoxicity against human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) cells from the culture supernatant was measured by Trypan Blue exclusion test. RESULTS: The present study characterized ascofuranone as a highly potent inhibitor of QPO (K(i) = 9.557 +/- 0.865 nm). Ascofuranone inhibited secretion of LtxA by A. actinomycetemcomitans in a dose-dependent manner, making A. actinomycetemcomitans less pathogenic to HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Quinol peroxidase inhibitors are promising candidates as alternative drugs for the treatment and prevention of the onset of localized aggressive periodontitis. Using ascofuranone as a seed compound, further study of QPO inhibitors could provide novel chemotherapeutic strategies for controlling localized aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Combination of 10% EDTA, Photosan, and a blue light hand-held photopolymerizer to inactivate leading oral bacteria in dentistry in vitro.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to investigate the phototoxicity of Photosan in  combination with EDTA and a hand-held photopolymerizer used in dentistry for light-curing resins against leading key pathogens in caries, endodontic treatment failures, and periodontitis respectively. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cellular uptake of Photosan was detected by fluorescence spectroscopy for Streptococcus mutans and Enterococcus faecalis but not for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Addition of 10% EDTA enabled the uptake of Photosan by A. actinomycetemcomitans. Killing of S. mutans and E. faecalis mediated by Photosan and blue light was concentration and light dose dependent, achieving a >or=99.9% (>or=3 log(10) reduction) efficacy of bacteria killing. In the presence of 10% EDTA, Photosan induced a reduction of >or=4 log(10) in the viability of A. actinomycetemcomitans at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1), upon activation at a dose of 9.65 J cm(-2) for 60 s. EDTA alone, light alone, and Photosan alone were not able to kill bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Ten per cent EDTA and Photosan cause a potent phototoxicity against oral bacteria upon illumination with a photopolymerizer. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Increasing antibiotic resistance and insufficient drug concentrations within the sulcus fluid are responsible for lacking antimicrobial efficacy. This study provides useful information that combination of Photosan, EDTA, and a photopolymerizer may be a potentially powerful tool for the efficient destroying of key oral bacteria.
TI  - Human cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. Viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. Because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. METHODS: Macrophages preinfected with HCMV or EBV were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. Bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. The virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. RESULTS: Both HCMV and EBV significantly diminished the TNF-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. CONCLUSION: Infection by HCMV or EBV inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.
TI  - The microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the Dental School of the University of Athens, who were split into three age groups. A total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: All of the test species, except Parvimonas micra and Porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial profiles for the different oral surfaces. Supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of Actinomyces species and Green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the Yellow complex. The profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. Many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. Periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. Specifically, the Red complex species (Tannerella forsythia, P. gingivalis, Treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (P < 0.05) in all sample locations. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. Differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of Orange and Red complex species.
TI  - Does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? Strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. The leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (RMGIC) was evaluated together with its uptake by superficial dental enamel. METHODS: The antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). Strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following Fuji Ortho LC application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. RESULTS: Strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. At the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. Under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. CONCLUSIONS: RMGIC releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. No significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. However synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.
TI  - The impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and who ate a diet available in the Stone Age. METHODS: Ten subjects living in an environment replicating the Stone Age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. Bleeding on probing (BOP), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (PD) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. Microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization methods. RESULTS: No subject had periodontitis. Mean BOP decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (P <0.001). Mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (P <0.001). PD at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; P <0.001). At week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (P <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including Bacteroides ureolyticus, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosis, and Streptococcus mitis. Bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (P <0.001) for 20 species, including Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and Streptococcus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., Stone Age) does not include refined sugars. Although plaque levels increased, BOP and PD decreased. Subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.
TI  - Relationship of neutrophil phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival  microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) dysfunctions have been associated with severe forms of periodontitis. This study evaluated the correlation between PMN phagocytosis and oxidative burst with the subgingival microbiota of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP). METHODS: Heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained from 18 GAgP patients and 11 periodontally healthy (PH) subjects, and PMNs were isolated on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. For phagocytosis analysis, PMNs were incubated with fluorescein-labeled Staphylococcus aureus. The oxidative burst was evaluated by incubation of PMNs with dihydroethidium and activation by S. aureus. The assays were examined using flow cytometry. Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from periodontal sites with and without periodontitis and 24 species were detected by checkerboard. RESULTS: A significantly lower phagocytosis rate was observed for patients with GAgP compared with PH subjects over time (P < 0.05). No differences between groups were found for superoxide production. GAgP patients presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype b than controls (P < 0.05). Significant negative correlations between T. forsythia and P. gingivalis and PMN functions were observed. CONCLUSIONS: GAgP subjects presented diminished phagocytic activity of peripheral PMNs and high prevalence and levels of classical periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. METHODS: Bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6 weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (BOP) was recorded at sites sampled at the four time points. RESULTS: The mean BOP at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. The corresponding mean BOP at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). Total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (P <0.01). Increased bacterial counts over time were found for Neisseria mucosa (P <0.001). Lower counts (P <0.001) were found for Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, Fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, Selenomonas noxia, and Veillonella parvula. No changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. Counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Treponema denticola did not change. Counts of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. P. gingivalis and T. forsythia counts were associated with BOP at week 12. A decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. Only counts of N. mucosa increased.
TI  - Detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. To define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. METHOD: Following acceptance into the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. In addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. Bacterial DNA was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. RESULTS: Streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. As for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. Furthermore, the positive rate of S. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for S. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species, such as S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.
TI  - Oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in HEp-2 cells by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. P. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. The failure of host defenses to eliminate P. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in P. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. There is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. An in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on P. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. Oral pathogens including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of P. aeruginosa into HEp-2 cells from one- to threefold. In contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on P. aeruginosa invasion. P. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from HEp-2 cells than did P. aeruginosa alone. P. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of HEp-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. These results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster P. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.
TI  - Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans adhesion inhibited in a flow cell.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial interactions are considered important in the adhesion process of pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity. This study addressed the hypothesis that a streptococcal biofilm influences the hard tissue colonization by the periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans under hydrodynamic conditions. METHODS: The colonization of a green-fluorescent-protein-labelled A. actinomycetemcomitans strain on surfaces coated with a streptococcal biofilm, was monitored in real time using a confocal laser scanning microscope-mounted flow cell. Culture and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were obtained in parallel from a Modified Robbins Device. RESULTS: Colonization of A. actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited by the four tested streptococci (Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus cristatus, Streptococcus salivarius, and Streptococcus mitis). The most inhibiting species was S. sanguinis. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed the hypothesis that some bacterial species influence A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of hard surfaces in vitro under hydrodynamic conditions.
TI  - Design of bacteria-agglutinating peptides derived from parotid secretory protein, a member of the bactericidal/permeability increasing-like protein family.
AB  - Parotid secretory protein (PSP) (SPLUNC2), a potential host-defense protein related to bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), was used as a template to design antibacterial peptides. Based on the structure of BPI, new PSP peptides were designed and tested for antibacterial activity. The peptides did not exhibit significant bactericidal activity or inhibit growth but the peptide GL-13 induced bacterial matting, suggesting passive agglutination of bacteria. GL-13 was shown to agglutinate the Gram negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aggregatibacter (Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, Gram positive Streptococcus gordonii and uncoated sheep erythrocytes. Bacterial agglutination was time and dose-dependent and involved hydrophobic interactions. Variant forms of GL-13 revealed that agglutination also depended on the number of amine groups on the peptide. GL-13 inhibited the adhesion of bacteria to plastic surfaces and the peptide prevented the spread of P. aeruginosa infection in a lettuce leaf model, suggesting that GL-13 is active in vivo. Moreover, GL-13-induced agglutination enhanced the phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. These results suggest that GL-13 represents a class of antimicrobial peptides, which do not directly kill bacteria but instead reduce bacterial adhesion and promote agglutination, leading to increased clearance by host phagocytic cells. Such peptides may cause less bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotic peptides.
TI  - Streptococcus cristatus attenuates Fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. Various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. Evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, Streptococcus cristatus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: KB, TERT-2, TR146 and SCC15 cells were cocultured with F. nucleatum and S. cristatus, either alone or in combination, at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2 under various conditions. The mRNA expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: F. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas S. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. When present together, S. cristatus attenuated the F. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. The inhibitory effect of S. cristatus was independent of its viability and its co-aggregation with F. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. Similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that S. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to F. nucleatum challenge.
TI  - Strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. In addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from Salvadora persica (Arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. This may be attributable to the extraction process. Our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. METHODS: Miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against Streptococcus mutans, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, Haemophilus influenzae. The miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect was most pronounced on P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and H. influenzae, less on S. mutans, and least on L. acidophilus. Suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. The 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on A. actinomycetemcomitans and H. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. The antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.
TI  - Treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched twins. METHODS: The study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. Fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. The reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. An integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. RESULTS: After the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. Those included Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Prevotella intermedia, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Streptococcus mutans. Microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. CONCLUSION: In a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.
TI  - Analysis of the activity to induce toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-mediated stimulation of supragingival plaque.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The deleterious effects of the accumulation of supragingival plaque are well known, but the role of the proinflammatory property of supragingival plaque in periodontal diseases has not been completely elucidated. The aim of this study was to determine the relevance of Toll-like receptor (TLR)2- and TLR4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque to periodontal parameters. METHODS: We isolated 144 supragingival plaque samples and analyzed TLR2- and TLR4-stimulating activity using genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary reporter cells that express a reporter molecule upon activation of nuclear factor-kappa B through TLR2 or TLR4. The numbers of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and Streptococcus mutans cells in each plaque sample were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The activity to induce TLR4-mediated stimulation, but not TLR2-mediated stimulation, was positively associated with the plaque score and bleeding on probing score of the teeth from which the plaque samples were taken. The activity to induce TLR2-mediated stimulation, but not TLR4-mediated stimulation, was negatively associated with probing depth and clinical attachment level. The ratio of TLR4-/TLR2-mediated stimulation was positively associated with all of those parameters. The number of P. gingivalis cells in each plaque sample was associated with the plaque score and clinical attachment level, but no strong association was observed between the ratio of examined bacteria in each plaque sample and the activity to induce TLR2- or TLR4-mediated stimulation, except for a weak correlation between the ratio of A. actinomycetemcomitans cells and the activity to induce TLR4-mediated stimulation. CONCLUSION: The TLR2- and TLR4-stimulating activity of supragingival plaque is associated with clinical parameters for gingivitis and periodontitis.
TI  - Comparative analysis of putative periodontopathic bacteria by multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. However, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional PCR detection system can be used by clinicians. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To develop a PCR-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional PCR, we established a multiplex PCR for five putative periodontopathic (Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia and Tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. RESULTS: Among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of T. denticola and P. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical parameters tested. Detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. CONCLUSION: The multiplex PCR system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional PCR. These results support the potential clinical use of multiplex PCR for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.
TI  - Characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. We aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. METHODS: The study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. All strains were identified using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of low pH and bile content. Thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. RESULTS: The majority of strains suppressed the growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited Candida albicans. The lowest pH tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was pH 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this pH. All strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (V/V)]. Four Lactobacillus plantarum and two Lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of L. plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. The absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in L. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. These results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics for oral health.
TI  - Microbiological diversity of generalized aggressive periodontitis by 16S rRNA clonal analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the bacterial diversity in the subgingival plaque of subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis by using culture-independent molecular methods based on 16S ribosomal DNA cloning. METHODS: Samples from 10 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were selected. DNA was extracted and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the universal primer pairs 9F and 1525R. Amplified genes were cloned, sequenced, and identified by comparison with known 16S rRNA sequences. RESULTS: One hundred and ten species were identified from 10 subjects and 1007 clones were sequenced. Of these, 70 species were most prevalent. Fifty-seven percent of the clone (40 taxa) sequences represented phylotypes for which no cultivated isolates have been reported. Several species of Selenomonas and Streptococcus were found at high prevalence and proportion in all subjects. Overall, 50% of the clone libraries were formed by these two genera. Selenomonas sputigena, the species most commonly detected, was found in nine of 10 subjects. Other species of Selenomonas were often present at high levels, including S. noxia, Selenomonas sp. EW084, Selenomonas sp. EW076, Selenomonas FT050, Selenomonas sp. P2PA_80, and Selenomonas sp. strain GAA14. The classical putative periodontal pathogens, such as, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, was below the limit of detection and was not detected. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that other species, notably species of Selenomonas, may be associated with disease in generalized aggressive periodontitis subjects.
TI  - SMAP29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. SMAP29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of SMAP29, SMAP28, and three congeners (SMAP18A, SMAP18D, and SMAP14A). METHODS: The peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity against multiple strains of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. Cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. RESULTS: SMAP28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, P < 0.05); however, the activity of SMAP28 and SMAP29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). The congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). Overall, F. nucleatum was the most susceptible organism, while P. gingivalis was the least susceptible. Keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. SMAP28 was the most cytotoxic, while SMAP14A was the least cytotoxic. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of SMAP29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other oral diseases.
TI  - Eugenol inhibited the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils.
AB  - Eugenol-containing restorative materials are commonly used for vital pulp therapy. A well-regulated host defense response is pivotal for the success of vital pulp therapy. The present study was to assess the effects of eugenol on the antimicrobial functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (neutrophils). Treatment with eugenol (< or = 1.25 mmol/L) for 30 minutes did not significantly affect the viability of neutrophils. However, preincubation of neutrophils with eugenol (1.25 mmol/L and 2.5 mmol/L) abolished their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, through the suppression of the extracellular release of myeloperoxidase and the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species, eugenol at sufficient concentrations impaired the activation of neutrophils by cytochalasin B and fMet-Leu-Phe (CB/fMLP). These results suggested that the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils were interfered by eugenol, and the inhibitory effects of eugenol (< or = 1.25 mmol/L) were not due to direct killing of neutrophils.
TI  - Microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (RT group) and in 13 matched controls. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. A clinical examination was also performed. RESULTS: Candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the RT subjects and in 15% of the controls. In three RT subjects, C. albicans was found at all four sites analysed. An unexpected finding was that enterococci were found in all RT subjects and in high number in 38%. None of the controls harboured enterococci. In supragingival plaque, Lactobacillus spp. were detected in 92% of the RT subjects and the number and proportion of Lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. Mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the RT subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. CONCLUSION: The microbial results explain why some RT subjects have an increased susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for RT subjects.
TI  - Reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. In many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. An alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. METHODS: Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae were evaluated as potential antagonists against P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, P. intermedia ATCC 49046, and A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718 as periodontopathogens. Adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. RESULTS: The largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for P. gingivalis. All antagonistic strains except S. crista ATCC 49999 inhibited the adhesion of P. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for A. naeslundii ATCC 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). Adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of A. actinomycetemcomitans ATCC 43718. Intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for P. intermedia, most notably caused by S. mitis BMS. CONCLUSION: The adhesion of P. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while S. mitis BMS appeared to be the most successful antagonist.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  - Extracts or alkaloids isolated from Mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. In this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a M. aquifolium extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the M. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. The values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. The most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was Porphyromonas gingivalis.
TI  - Susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty strains of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and human beta defensin-3. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. RESULTS: The minimum inhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. Although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to LL-37 than the others (p=0.004). The susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on the species but not on the strains. The periodontopathic bacteria, especially Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003). In addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some periodontopathic bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chitosan-based matrices on oral pathogens.
AB  - Chitosan is a well sought-after polysaccharide in biomedical applications due to  its biocompatibility, biodegradability to non-toxic substances, and ease of fabrication into various configurations. However, alterations in the anti-bacterial properties of chitosan in various forms is not completely understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the anti-bacterial properties of chitosan matrices in different configurations against two pathogens-Gram-positive Streptococcus mutans and Gram-negative Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Two-dimensional (2-D) membranes and three-dimensional (3-D) porous scaffolds were synthesized by air drying and controlled-rate freeze drying. Matrices were suspended in bacterial broths with or without lysozyme (enzyme that degrades chitosan). Influences of pore size, blending with Polycaprolactone (PCL, a synthetic polymer), and neutralization process on bacterial proliferation were studied. Transient changes in optical density of the broth, adhesion characteristics, viability, and contact-dependent bacterial activity were assessed. 3-D porous scaffolds were more effective in reducing the proliferation of S. mutans in suspension than 2-D membranes. However, no significant differences were observed on the proliferation of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Presence of lysozyme significantly increased the antibacterial activity of chitosan against A. actinomycetemcomitans. Pore size did not affect the proliferation kinetics of either species, with or without lysozyme. NaOH neutralization of chitosan increased bacterial adhesion whereas ethanol neutralization inhibited adhesion without lowering proliferation. Mat culture tests indicated that chitosan does not allow proliferation on its surface and it loses antibacterial activity upon blending with PCL. Results suggest that the chemical and structural characteristics of chitosan-based matrices can be manipulated to influence the interaction of different bacterial species.
TI  - Age-dependent deficiency in saliva and salivary antibodies secretion in Down's syndrome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Down's syndrome (DS) individuals suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections. Here, we assessed age-related changes in the salivary-specific humoral immunity of DS subjects. DESIGN: Parotid and whole saliva were collected from a young group of DS (YDS, n=30, 23.3+/-4 years), an older group of DS individuals (ODS, n=10, 51.9+/-8 years) and compared to two age-matched groups of healthy volunteers--a young group (YC, n=29, 22.8+/-5 years) and an older group (OC, n=10, 48.4+/-9 years). The levels of total IgA, and specific antibodies to three common oral pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus (Aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans) were analysed. RESULTS: The limited increases in IgA concentrations could not compensate the dramatic reduction in the salivary flow rate observed in DS individuals. Therefore, the median secretion rates of the specific antibodies in whole and parotid saliva were 70-77% and 34-60% (respectively) lower in YDS individuals as compared to YC and farther 77-100% and 75-88% (respectively) lower in ODS compared to YDS. In contrast, the antibody secretion rates were similar for parotid saliva, or even increased for whole saliva of OC, compared with YC. Consequently, a dramatic cumulative extreme reduction (>92%) in the bacterial specific salivary antibodies differentiated the adult DS individuals from to their age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a severe immunodeficiency in the secretion rate of the specific salivary IgA response of in DS individuals which intensifies with age.
TI  - Bacteria interfere with A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization.
AB  - It is known that beneficial bacteria can suppress the emergence of pathogenic bacteria, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. This study examined the potential for a similar suppression of Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells, due to its potential relevance in periodontal diseases. Seven presumed beneficial bacteria were examined for their ability to interfere, exclude, or displace A. actinomycetemcomitans from epithelial cells in vitro. Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius showed prominent inhibitory effects on either A. actinomycetemcomitans recovery or colonization. These results confirmed the hypothesis that bacterial interactions interfere with A. actinomycetemcomitans colonization of epithelial cells in vitro, and demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of S. mitis, S. salivarius, and S. sanguinis.
TI  - A novel exclusion mechanism for carbon resource partitioning in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - The bacterium Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a common commensal of the  human oral cavity and the putative causative agent of the disease localized aggressive periodontitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans is a slow-growing bacterium that possesses limited metabolic machinery for carbon utilization. This likely impacts its ability to colonize the oral cavity, where growth and community composition is mediated by carbon availability. We present evidence that in the presence of the in vivo relevant carbon substrates glucose, fructose, and lactate A. actinomycetemcomitans preferentially metabolizes lactate. This preference for lactate exists despite the fact that A. actinomycetemcomitans grows faster and obtains higher cell yields during growth with carbohydrates. The preference for lactate is mediated by a novel exclusion mechanism in which metabolism of lactate inhibits carbohydrate uptake. Coculture studies reveal that A. actinomycetemcomitans utilizes lactate produced by the oral bacterium Streptococcus gordonii, suggesting the potential for cross-feeding in the oral cavity.
TI  - [PCR detection of periodontal bacteria and Streptococcus mutans in the biological samples from the oral cavity].
AB  - The paper describes an optimized technique for DNA isolation from the Streptococcus mutans cultures and from the clinical samples including proteinase K treatment and detergent lysis, followed by sorbent-based enrichment. This technique was employed for isolating DNA from the periodontal bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Bacteroides forsythus. A multiplex PCR technique was adapted for large-scale studies of clinical samples. An original PCR method was developed for the semiquantitative detection of Str. mutans, showing the sensitivity of 100 genome copies per reaction. Extensive studies of approximately 2,000 individuals have demonstrated that these methods are applicable to the study of the dental and gingival microflora in the biological sample from the oral cavity of persons with dental diseases from various age groups.
TI  - Bacterial colonization immediately after installation on oral titanium implants.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on bacterial colonization immediately after dental implant insertion is limited. AIMS: (1) To assess the early colonization on titanium implants immediately after placement and throughout the first 12 post-surgical weeks, (2) to compare the microbiota at interproximal subgingival implant and adjacent tooth sites. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from implant and neighbouring teeth were studied by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization before surgery, 30 min after implant placement, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Comparing bacterial loads at implant sites between 30 min after placement with 1-week data showed that only the levels of Veillonella parvula (P<0.05) differed with higher loads at week 1 post-surgically. Week 12 data demonstrated significantly higher bacterial loads for 15/40 species at tooth sites compared with pre-surgery (P-values varying between 0.05 and 0.01). Between the period immediately after surgery and 12 weeks at implant sites, 29/40 species was more commonly found at 12 weeks. Included among these bacteria at implant sites were Porphyromonas gingivalis (P<0.05), Tannerella forsythia, (P<0.01), and Treponema denticola (P<0.001). Immediately post-surgery 5.9% of implants, and 26.2% of teeth, and at week 12, 15% of implants, and 39.1% of teeth harbored Staphylococcus aureus. Comparing tooth and implant sites, significantly higher bacterial loads were found at tooth sites for 27/40 species after 30 min following implant placement. This difference increased to 35/40 species at 12 weeks post-surgically. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial colonization occurred within 30 min after implant placement. Early colonization patterns differed between implant and tooth surfaces.
TI  - Identification of periodontopathic bacteria in gingival tissue of Japanese periodontitis patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The identification of invading periodontopathic bacteria in tissues is important to determine their role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease. The objective of this study was to identify periodontopathic bacteria in diseased gingival tissue of periodontitis patients. METHODS: Subgingival plaque and gingival tissue were collected from 32 generalized chronic periodontitis (CP), 16 generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) and eight localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) patients. Detection frequencies and quantities of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Tannerella forsythensis were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. The prevalences of Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sobrinus were also examined and the distribution of A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes was observed. RESULTS: P. gingivalis and T. forsythensis were detected in approximately 70% of tissue samples and 50% of plaque samples in the three periodontitis groups. Prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans in tissue samples was higher in the LAgP (63%) group than in either the CP (16%) or the GAgP (38%) group. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype c was detected in 50% of LAgP patients. Detection frequencies of S. oralis and S. sobrinus were markedly low in both plaque and tissue samples from all three periodontitis groups. Amounts of P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythensis in the tissue samples were not different among the three periodontitis groups. CONCLUSION: P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and T. forsythensis can localize in diseased gingival tissue and may be involved in periodontal tissue destruction. Serotype c is the predominant serotype of A. actinomycetemcomitans in Japanese LAgP patients.
TI  - Saliva from subjects harboring Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans kills Streptococcus mutans in vitro.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research indicated that patients with localized aggressive periodontitis (LAgP) had minimal proximal decay. We speculated that differences in these two proximal dental diseases (LAgP and proximal decay) in LAgP could be due to the effect of saliva on the growth of key microorganisms related to these two infections. Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is required for growth of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), the reputed cause of LAgP. Bicarbonate, a source of CO(2), buffers acid production by Streptococcus mutans (Sm), a key organism associated with caries. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the saliva of LAgP patients and subjects with Aa had higher levels of bicarbonate, or an elevated pH, and/or reduced survival of Sm. METHODS: Eleven Aa-positive subjects (seven with LAgP) were matched with 11 Aa-negative controls. A total of 5 ml saliva obtained from each subject was tested for CO(2) levels, pH, and effects on survival of Aa and Sm. Saliva from 22 additional subjects was used for confirmatory data. RESULTS: CO(2) levels in the test group (Aa-positive subjects) and controls (Aa-negatives) were similar. No clinically relevant differences were found in salivary pH. However, saliva from the test group killed Sm by more than two logs (P <0.05). No effect was seen on Aa. The saliva from the Aa-negative group killed Aa by two logs (P <0.05). No effect was seen on Sm. CONCLUSION: Aa-positive subjects had a salivary factor that significantly reduced survival of Sm, which may help to explain the fact that this group typically has minimal proximal decay.
TI  - Antibacterial diterpenoids from Sagittaria pygmaea.
AB  - There were five new diterpenoids, 18-beta-D-3',4'-diacetoxyxylopyranosyl-ent-kaur-16-ene (1), 18-beta-L-3',5'-diacetoxyarabinofuranosyl-ent-kaur-16-ene (2), 18-beta-D-3',6'-diacetoxyglucopyranosyl-ent-kaur-16-ene (3), ent-isopimar-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid (4), and 5alpha-hydroxy-ent-rosa-15-en-18-oic acid (5), isolated from the whole herb of Sagittaria pygmaea. Their structures and relative configurations were established based on spectroscopic studies, chemical methods, and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Compound 2 exhibited significant antibacterial activity against the oral pathogens, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25 175 and Actinomyces viscosus ATCC 27 044, with MIC values against both pathogens of 15.6 microg/mL. Compound 3 was active against only A. viscosus ATCC 27 044 with an MIC value of 62.5 microg/mL. Compounds 4 and 5 were active against S. mutans ATCC 25 175 and A. viscosus ATCC 27 044, with MIC values against both pathogens of 125.0 microg/mL.
TI  - Caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  - In vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. The aim of this investigation was to establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. Microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on Thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. Microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization analysis. pH was measured as an indicator of cariogenic potential. The composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. Artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and pH conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. Complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. Sucrose supplementation limited the decline of Streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance of mutans Streptococci. Sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to Actinomyces israelii, Rothia dentocariosa and Capnocytophaga gingivalis. The microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and pH.
TI  - Gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  - Transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the oral commensal Streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal Fusobacterium nucleatum. Overall, F. nucleatum and S. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (M. Handfield, J. J. Mans, G. Zheng, M. C. Lopez, S. Mao, A. Progulske-Fox, G. Narasimhan, H. V. Baker, and R. J. Lamont, Cell. Microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). The biological pathways significantly impacted by F. nucleatum and S. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. Differential regulation of GADD45 and DUSP4, key components of the MAPK pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by Western blotting. Modulation of the MAPK pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, both the MAPK and Toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 demonstrated that F. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas S. gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. Stimulation of secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of F. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of F. nucleatum than of S. gordonii.
TI  - Oral bacteria in plaque and invading buccal cells of young orthodontic patients.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this longitudinal study, patients with fixed orthodontic appliances served as models to determine whether Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, and total streptococci increased after treatment, and whether treatment affected bacterial invasion into the adjacent buccal epithelial cells (BEC). METHODS: Supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and BEC were collected from 27 patients before and at least 4 weeks after placement of orthodontic fixed appliances. Total sample DNA was determined, and bacteria were assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The BEC were also examined by confocal microscopy after fluorescent in-situ hybridization to visually detect the presence of each species bacteria in BEC. RESULTS: Total DNA in supragingival and subgingival plaque increased after appliance placement (P = .005). There was also a significant increase in supragingival streptococci (P = .0002). By confocal microscopy, a trend toward fewer buccal cells recovered was found after appliance placement, and there was a significant increase in the percentage of buccal cells containing A. actinomycetemcomitans (P = .0058). CONCLUSIONS: Appliance placement appeared to increase buccal cell susceptibility to A. actinomycetemcomitans invasion. This might be due to physical trauma or to leaching of metals from the appliances.
TI  - A short-term clinical and microbial evaluation of periodontal therapy associated  with amalgam overhang removal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effect of periodontal therapy plus amalgam overhang removal (PT+AOR) on periodontal status and the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans and compared two microbiological sampling techniques. METHODS: Molar teeth with Class II overhang restorations were selected as the test group, and homologous sound teeth were selected as the control group. Periodontal probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and plaque and gingival indices were measured, and restorations were evaluated using radiographs and clinical exploration at baseline (T1) and 90 days after PT+AOR (T2). Microbial samples were taken with dental floss and paper points at T1 and T2. S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were detected using culture and commercial kits. RESULTS: Mean values of plaque and gingival indices did not show statistically significant differences between test and control teeth between T1 and T2. At T2, the mean CAL decreased among test teeth, and the number of test teeth positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans showed a decrease, whereas positive samples for S. mutans increased. At T1, an association between the two sampling techniques for both bacteria was found. At T2, dental floss presented low sensitivity values for A. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas paper points showed low sensitivity for S. mutans. CONCLUSIONS: PT+AOR showed a beneficial effect on clinical parameters and a decrease of A. actinomycetemcomitans. At T1, both sampling techniques showed appropriate results. At T2, the use of paper points was a more sensitive sampling technique for isolate A. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas dental floss was found to be an alternative sampling method for isolate S. mutans.

TI  - Expression of the short fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis is regulated in oral bacterial consortia.
AB  - The Mfa1 protein of Porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between P. gingivalis and Streptococcus gordonii. We utilized a promoter-lacZ reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. Promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by S. gordonii, Streptococcus sanguinis and Streptococcus mitis. In contrast, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus cristatus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. Expression of SspA/B, the streptococcal receptor for Mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. Proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of Mfa1 expression. Porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.
TI  - Microbiological composition associated with interleukin-1 gene polymorphism in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin-1 gene polymorphism (IL-1 gene) has been associated with  periodontitis. The present study examined the subgingival microbiota by IL-1 gene status in subjects undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (SPT). METHODS: A total of 151 subjects with known IL-1 gene status (IL-1A +4845/IL-1B -3954) (IL-1 gene) were included in this study. Clinical data and subgingival plaque samples (40 taxa) were collected. These taxa were determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: Gender, smoking habits (n-par tests), age, and clinical periodontal conditions did not differ by IL-1 gene status. IL-1 gene-negative subjects had a higher total bacterial load (mean difference, 480.4 x 10(5); 95% confidence interval [CI], 77 to 884 x 10(5); P <0.02). The levels of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (mean difference, 30.7 x 10(5); 95% CI, 2.2 to 59.5 x 10(5); P <0.05), Eubacterium nodatum (mean difference, 4.2 x 10(5); 95% CI, 0.6 to 7.8 x 10(5); P <0.02), Porphyromonas gingivalis (mean difference, 17.9 x 10(5); 95% CI, 1.2 to 34.5 x 10(5); P <0.05), and Streptococcus anginosus (mean difference, 4.0 x 10(5); 95% CI, 0.2 to 7.2 x 10(5); P <0.05) were higher in IL-1 gene-negative subjects, an observation specifically found at sites with probing depths <5.0 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Bleeding on probing did not differ by IL gene status, reflecting clinical SPT efficacy. IL-1 gene-negative subjects had higher levels of periodontal pathogens. This may suggest that among subjects undergoing SPT, a lower bacterial load is required in IL-1 gene-positive subjects to develop the same level of periodontitis as in IL-1 gene-negative subjects.
TI  - Selective inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor Xa inhibitor, DX-9065a.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. However, there is no drug specific for P. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor X, DX-9065a, on growth of Porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. METHODS: We incubated P. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of DX-9065a and examined the effect of DX-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. We also examined the effects of DX9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains RgpA and RgpB), from P. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. RESULTS: DX-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of P. gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and its effect on P. gingivalis was bactericidal. Trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected in P. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by DX-9065a. DX-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of RgpA and RgpB from P. gingivalis. Furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by DX-9065a. CONCLUSIONS: DX-9065a inhibits P. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in P. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongue dorsum of elderly people.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. In addition, the relationship between the number of teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of 85-year-old people was assessed. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. Five periodontopathic bacteria (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (Streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. RESULTS: Periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. Between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for P. gingivalis (p<0.0001), T. denticola (p<0.001), F. nucleatum (p=0.002), and T. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for A. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or S. mutans (p=0.147). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. It was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. There was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that tongue care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.
TI  - The efficacy of povidone-iodine products against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - A total of 8 strains of 6 bacterial species, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC33277 and TDC286, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ATCC29523 and JP2, Fusobacterium nucleatum No. 2, Tannerella forsythensis ATCC43937, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611 and Streptococcus anginosus ATCC33397, were treated with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) gargle (PVP-I: 0.47 and 0.23% w/v) or chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) gargle (CHG: 0.002% w/v) for 15, 30 or 60 s, after which they were inoculated into various media, cultured and counted for residual bacteria. At both concentrations, PVP-I gargle reduced the viable cell count of all 8 bacterial strains to below the measurable limit within 15 s. By contrast, there were more than 1,000 viable colonies 60 s following treatment with the CHG gargle. The results demonstrate that povidone-iodine gargle has rapid bactericidal activity against the causative bacteria of periodontal disease.
TI  - Effect of a stannous fluoride dentifrice on the sulcular microbiota: a prospective cohort study in subjects with various levels of periodontal inflammation.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of an experimental 0.454% stannous fluoride (SnF2) dentifrice on the oral sulcular microbiota in patients with various stages of oral diseases using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present one-month, single center, single product, prospective cohort trial, 37 adults (mean age 37.6) were assigned to one of four oral health condition cohorts with seven to 10 subjects each: 1. mild gingivitis, 2. marked generalized gingivitis to moderate periodontitis, 3. caries-prone and 4. treated moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis in supportive periodontal care. All four groups were asked to use the test dentifrice and a power toothbrush twice a day for one minute during a four-week test period. Before and after the trial period, Plaque Indices (PII, Silness and Loe, 1964) and Gingival Indices (GI, Loe and Silness, 1963) were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were collected from all patients at Baseline, as well as after two and four weeks. These samples were analyzed for content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: As a result of the only one minute brushing with the stannous fluoride dentifrice, the mean PII at Baseline was significantly lower (p < 0.05) from the mean PII at four weeks. No statistically significant differences were found between premolar and molar mean values. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were found between the mean GI at Baseline and at four weeks. The microbiological analysis showed that at baseline subjects in groups 2 and 4 had significantly higher bacterial loads of bacteria than groups 1, and 3 (i.e. A. actinomyctemcomitans P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola. Over the study period, the total bacterial load did not change in groups 2, 3 and 4. In groups 1 and 3, however, an increase in the loads of Streptococci spp. were noticed (p < 0.05) including S. mitis, S. intermedius, and S. sanguis (p < 0.01) suggesting an increase in the presence of early colonizing and health associated bacteria. CONCLUSION: One minute brushing with a 0.454% stannous fluoride dentifrice did--after four weeks--not affect the subgingival microbial profiles in patients with moderate periodontitis and treated moderate to advanced periodontitis. However, the sulcular microbial profiles of mild gingivitis and caries-prone patients were affected, indicating a shift towards a gingival health associated microbiota in the sulcular region of patients not affected by attachment loss. RUNNING HEAD: Effect of stannous fluoride on sulcular microbiota.

TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - A searchable database for proteomes of oral microorganisms.
AB  - An online database of proteomes for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) gel data was constructed and it is now freely accessible through a web-based interface. Proteins from three oral bacteria, Streptococcus mutans UA159, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans HK1651, and Porphyromonas gingivalis W83, whose genome databases are freely available, were separated by 2DE, and protein spots were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and identified. About 1000 spots from the gels of P. gingivalis W83 were extracted and analyzed by MALDI-TOF, and 330 proteins were identified. In addition, 160 of 240 spots of A. actinomycetemcomitans and 158 of 356 spots of S. mutans were identified. Information such as spot coordinates on the gels, protein names (predicted functions), molecular weights, isoelectroric points, and links to online databases, including Oral Pathogen Sequence Databases of the Los Alamos National Laboratory Bioscience Division (ORALGEN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or The Institute Genomic Research (TIGR), were stored in tables accessible through the relational database management system MySQL on an Apache web server. To test for functionality of this database system, responses of S. mutans to environmental changes were analyzed using the database and 21 spots on the gel were identified as proteins whose expression had been increased or decreased by environmental pH change without in-gel trypsin digestion, protein extraction, or MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS (mass spectrometer) analysis. The identified proteins are agreement with those reported in previous papers on acid tolerance of S. mutans, demonstrating the usefulness of the system. This database is available at http://www.myamagu.dent.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~bioinformatics/index.html or http://www.bipos.mascat.nihon-u.ac.jp/index.html.
TI  - In vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. METHODOLOGY: Saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. The subjects were asked to place the strip (Listerine PocketPaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. After 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees C for seven days. Colony counts (CFU/mL) were determined for each sample. The colonies on the plates were washed with 1 mL of TE buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by DNA probes and the Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. Differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by Wilcoxon sign rank and Chi-square tests. RESULTS: A modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). Most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels, including the pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium spp., P. intermedia, and S. noxia, as well as the beneficial species A. meyeri, A. georgia, A. gerencseriae, A. odontolyticus, and P. acnes after strip placement. In contrast, A. viscosus, P. melaninogenica, P. gingivalis, P. micros, Streptococcus spp., T. forsythensis, and V. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. These changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022). CONCLUSION: The use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. In addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.
TI  - Attachment of periodontal ligament cells onto various antibiotics-loaded GTR membranes.
AB  - This study compared the natures of various guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membranes impregnated with amoxicillin or tetracycline. Whether the antibiotics-loaded membranes enhance the attachment of the periodontal ligament cells in the presence of oral pathogens was further analyzed. S mutans and A actinomycetemcomitans diminished the attachment of periodontal ligament cells onto the membranes as evaluated by SEM analysis. These bacterial effects on cellular attachment could be reversed using the antibiotics-loaded membranes. The information obtained in this study is valuable for the future application of antibiotics-loaded membranes during GTR therapy.
TI  - Susceptibility of Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 in biological fluids.
AB  - Bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the presence of saliva and/or serum. Increasing the concentration of hBD-3 partially overcame this inhibition. A fast bactericidal effect was observed against both bacterial strains, suggesting a potential therapeutic use for hBD-3 in the local treatment of oral infections.
TI  - Effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  - According to the US Surgeon General's report, "Oral Health in America," published in 2000, most adults in the United States show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. Periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. New evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. For this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. This article summarizes laboratory research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. This unique combination of agents is found in Colgate Total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. In addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone resorption. Overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of Colgate Total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.
TI  - Efficacy of antibiotics against periodontopathogenic bacteria within epithelial cells: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontopathogenic bacteria can invade and survive within epithelial cells, but susceptibility of intracellular infection to antibiotics used in periodontitis treatment has not been studied to date. METHODS: KB cells were infected by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, strain NCTC 9710; Porphyromonas gingivalis, strains ATCC 33277 and JH16-1; or Streptococcus constellatus, strain J012b. After 2, 4, and 12 hours the bactericidal effect of antibiotics (clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin) on intracellular microorganisms was tested at a concentration up to the 100-fold minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determined separately on planktonic bacteria. RESULTS: The P. gingivalis strains differed in their invasiveness and ATCC 33277 was 100-fold more invasive than JH16-1. Doxycycline and clindamycin at a concentration 10-fold MIC had no effect, but P. gingivalis intercellular infection was significantly reduced by metronidazole at 10-fold MIC after 2 and 4 hours. Moxifloxacin was effective, but a 100-fold MIC concentration was necessary to reduce P. gingivalis strains intracellular growth to 7% of the control. Other bacterial species grown inside the KB cells were more susceptible to antibiotics. Clindamycin at 10-fold MIC reduced the number of intracellular S. constellatus after 4 and 12 hours. This bacterium was eliminated by moxifloxacin at 50-fold MIC. Intracellular A. actinomycetemcomitans was killed by 10-fold MIC of doxycycline and moxifloxacin after 4 hours incubation. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic to treat intracellular infection. However, taking into account the MIC values and the levels of antibiotics in gingival fluid, elimination of intracellular bacteria by antibiotics alone seems to be questionable.
TI  - In situ biofilm formation by multi-species oral bacteria under flowing and anaerobic conditions.
AB  - An understanding of biofilm behavior of periodontopathic bacteria is key to the development of effective oral therapies. We hypothesized that interspecies bacterial aggregates play an important role in anaerobic biofilm establishment and proliferation, and contribute to the survivability of the biofilm against therapeutic agents. The system developed in this study assessed a multi-species (Streptococcus gordonii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) biofilm formation under anaerobic and flowing conditions with the use of an in situ image analysis system. The biofilm was comprised of a base film of non-aggregated cells and complex interspecies aggregates that formed in the planktonic phase which rapidly colonized the surface, reaching 58 +/- 9% and 65 +/- 11.8% coverage by 5 and 24 hrs, respectively. Upon SDS (0.1%) treatment of a 24-hour biofilm, substantial detachment (55 +/- 14%, P < 0.05) of the aggregates was observed, while the base film bacteria remained attached but non-viable. Rapid re-establishment of the biofilm occurred via attachment of viable planktonic aggregates.
TI  - Efficacy of ozone on survival and permeability of oral microorganisms.
AB  - In the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water on oral microorganisms and dental plaque. Almost no microorganisms were detected after being treated with ozonated water (4 mg/l) for 10 s. To estimate the ozonated water-treated Streptococcus mutans, bacterial cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial Viability Kit. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that S. mutans cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water. Some breakage of ozonated water-treated S. mutans was found by electron microscopy. When the experimental dental plaque was exposed to ozonated water, the number of viable S. mutans remarkably decreased. Ozonated water strongly inhibited the accumulation of experimental dental plaque in vitro. After the dental plaque samples from human subjects were exposed to ozonated water in vitro, almost no viable bacterial cells were detected. These results suggest that ozonated water should be useful in reducing the infections caused by oral microorganisms in dental plaque.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance profile of the subgingival microbiota following systemic or local tetracycline therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tetracyclines have been extensively used as adjunctives to conventional periodontal therapy. Emergence of resistant strains, however, has been reported. This study evaluated longitudinally the tetracycline resistance patterns of the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis subjects treated with systemic or local tetracycline therapy+scaling and root planing (SRP). METHODS: Thirty chronic periodontitis patients were randomly assigned to three groups: SRP+500 mg of systemic tetracycline twice/day for 14 days; SRP alone and SRP+tetracycline fibers (Actsite) at four selected sites for 10 days. Subgingival plaque samples were obtained from four sites with probing pocket depths (PPD)> or =6 mm in each patient at baseline, 1 week, 3, 6 and 12 months post-therapy. Samples were dispersed and diluted in pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized Ringer's solution, plated on Trypticase Soy Agar (TSA)+5% blood with or without 4 microg/ml of tetracycline and incubated anaerobically for 10 days. The percentage of resistant microorganisms were determined and the isolates identified by DNA probes and the checkerboard method. Significance of differences among and within groups over time was sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests, respectively. RESULTS: The percentage of resistant microorganisms increased significantly at 1 week in the tetracycline groups, but dropped to baseline levels over time. The SRP+Actsite group presented the lowest proportions of resistant species at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were observed in the SRP group. The predominant tetracycline-resistant species included Streptococcus spp., Veillonela parvula, Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella intermedia, Gemella morbillorum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa). A high percentage of sites with resistant Aa, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tanerella forsythensis was observed in all groups at baseline. However, T. forsythensis was not detected in any group and P. gingivalis was not present in the SRP+Actsite group at 1 year post-therapy. Aa was still frequently detected in all groups after therapy. However, the greatest reduction was observed in the SRP+Actsite group. CONCLUSION: Local or systemically administered tetracycline results in transitory selection of subgingival species intrinsically resistant to this drug. Although the percentage of sites harboring periodontal pathogens resistant to tetracycline were quite elevated in this population, both therapies were effective in reducing their prevalence over time.
TI  - Efficacy of antibiotics to strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria within a single species biofilm - an in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined differences in the efficacy of antibiotics against a single strain of three periodontal pathogens grown in an artificial biofilm. METHODS: Single species biofilms were established with artificial saliva and one of the following bacterial strains: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Streptococcus constellatus 384b (a clinical isolate) and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277. The efficacy of the antibiotics clindamycin, doxycycline, metronidazole, and moxifloxacin to these bacteria was determined using concentrations up to 100-fold minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to planctonic bacteria over 48 h. RESULTS: The ability of the bacteria to form a biofilm varied. The biofilms of S. constellatus 384b and A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 contained more viable bacteria and showed a larger thickness in SEM photographs than those of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. The antibiotics tested showed different efficacy for the different strains. Moxifloxacin was the most efficient antibiotic: onefold MIC was sufficient to eliminate A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 after 48 h. However, only the 50-fold MIC completely eradicated S. constellatus 384b. SEM photographs underlined the damaging effect of moxifloxacin on the biofilm structure. CONCLUSION: The complete removal of bacteria by the use of antibiotics alone seems to be impossible when taking into account MIC values and the level of antibiotics in gingival fluid.
TI  - A comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  - Cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sobrinus. We tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. The essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. Minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. Periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. Tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against P. gingivalis. All the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of S. mutans. This study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. From the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.
TI  - A rapid procedure to ascertain the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations.
AB  - A rapid method examining the antimicrobial efficacy of oral care formulations with alamar blue, an oxidation-reduction dye with fluorescent end-points, is described. Significant correlations between increasing viable plate counts of the oral bacteria Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and increased alamar fluorescence were noted. Metabolically active bacteria reduced alamar with the reduced dye found in the cell-free filtrate. Insignificant alamar reductions were noted in the absence of bacteria or by spent culture supernatants. The efficacy of mouthrinses with clinically proven antiplaque agents such as chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride were determined by alamar blue. In a model system with A. viscosus, triclosan dentifrices demonstrate a dose-dependent effect on bacteria. Human salivary bacteria demonstrate increasing alamar fluorescence with increasing plate counts. A clinical study examined the effects of rinsing with chlorhexidine or cetylpyridinium chloride mouthrinses in comparison with a placebo mouthrinse and water on salivary bacteria. Rinsing with chlorhexidine resulted in the least number of bacteria by alamar and plate count methods. In summary, the current study demonstrates the utility of alamar blue to examine the antimicrobial effects of oral care formulations in laboratory and clinical studies.
TI  - Susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  - Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. In general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. As an alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. A novel decapeptide, KKVVFKVKFK (KSL), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. Cytotoxic activity of KSL against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional NMR in aqueous and DMSO solutions. MICs of KSL for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). Minimal bactericidal concentrations of KSL were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the MICs. KSL exhibited an ED(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees C) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of Lactobacillus salivarius, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus gordonii and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In addition, KSL damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. In vitro toxicity studies showed that KSL, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. NMR studies suggest that KSL adopts an alpha-helical structure in DMSO solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment, whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. This study shows that KSL may be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.
TI  - The presence of bacteria in the synovial fluid of the temporomandibular joint and clinical significance: preliminary study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to find any relation between the presence of specific bacterial species in the synovial fluid of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and clinical parameters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 43 patients (male-to-female ratio, 1:1.69; average age, 34.37 +/- 14.55 years). Thirty-three patients had a displaced disc in the TMJ (DD group), and 10 patients did not have a displaced disc of the TMJ or any symptom related to TMJ disorders (NDD group). Clinical examinations were made to determine maximum mouth opening, joint sounds, previous trauma history, systemic disease, and TMJ pain. Six bacterial species that were reported in other studies were chosen to evaluate the presence of bacteria in the TMJ for this study. RESULTS: Mycoplasma genitalium was most frequently detected in synovial fluid (86.0%). Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma fermentans/orale, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Streptococcus mitis were detected in 51.2%, 37.2%, 25.6%, and 7.0% of samples, respectively. beta-Hemolytic Streptococcus was not detected. The prevalence of S aureus was significantly higher in the DD group than in the NDD group (P <.05). The patients who had M. fermentans/orale were 5.40 times more likely to be younger than 30 years than were those without M. fermentans/orale (P <.05). Those with M. genitalium were 5.81 times more likely to be female than were those without M. genitalium (P <.05). CONCLUSION: The presence of S. aureus in TMJ synovial fluid was related to TMJ disorder symptoms and clinical parameters seemed to be influenced by bacterial presence in TMJ synovial fluid.
TI  - One of two human lactoferrin variants exhibits increased antibacterial and transcriptional activation activities and is associated with localized juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - The iron-binding protein lactoferrin is a ubiquitous and abundant constituent of  human exocrine secretions. Lactoferrin inhibits bacterial growth by sequestering essential iron and also exhibits non-iron-dependent antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunoregulatory activities. All of these non-iron-dependent activities are mediated by the highly charged N terminus of lactoferrin. In this study we characterized a Lys/Arg polymorphism at position 29 in the N-terminal region of human lactoferrin that results from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 1 of the human lactoferrin gene. We expressed cDNAs encoding both lactoferrin variants in insect cells and purified the two proteins by ion exchange chromatography. The two lactoferrin variants exhibited nearly identical iron-binding and iron-releasing activities and equivalent bactericidal activities against a strain of the gram-negative bacterium Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. When tested against the gram-positive species Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus mitis, however, lactoferrin containing Lys at position 29 exhibited significantly greater bactericidal activity than did lactoferrin containing Arg. In addition, the Lys-containing lactoferrin stimulated bovine tracheal epithelial cells to synthesize much higher levels of tracheal antimicrobial peptide mRNA than did the Arg-containing variant. A genotyping assay that distinguished between the two alleles based on a polymorphic EarI restriction site showed that the Lys and Arg alleles had frequencies of 24% and 76%, respectively, among 17 healthy human subjects, and 72% and 28%, respectively, among nine patients with localized juvenile periodontitis. Our findings suggest that these two lactoferrin variants are functionally different and that these differences may contribute to the pathogenesis of localized juvenile periodontitis.
TI  - Molecular genetic analysis of the virulence of oral bacterial pathogens: an historical perspective.
AB  - This review will focus on the impact of molecular genetic approaches on elucidating the bacterial etiology of oral diseases from an historical perspective. Relevant results from the pre- and post-recombinant DNA periods will be highlighted, including the roles of gene cloning, mutagenesis, and nucleotide sequencing in this area of research. Finally, the impact of whole-genome sequencing on deciphering the virulence mechanisms of oral pathogens, along with new approaches to control these organisms, will be discussed.
TI  - Activity of human beta-defensin 3 alone or combined with other antimicrobial agents against oral bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) alone or combined with lysozyme, metronidazole, amoxicillin, and chlorhexidine were investigated with the oral bacteria Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguinis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. hBD-3 showed bactericidal activity against all of the bacterial species tested. The bactericidal effect was enhanced when the peptide was used in combination with the antimicrobial agents mentioned above.
TI  - Coaggregation of Streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with Prevotella intermedia.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. Although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of S. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. To determine whether S. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we examined the ability of S. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. Our results show that S. salivarius coaggregated with Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. However, only fimbriated S. salivarius cells were able to coaggregate with P. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. Heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and EDTA, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between S. salivarius and periodontopathogens.
TI  - Application of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to the analysis of  microbial communities of subgingival plaque.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was applied to the microbiologic examination of subgingival plaque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PCR primers were designed from conserved nucleotide sequences on 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16SrDNA) with GC rich clamp at the 5'-end. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using the primers and genomic DNAs of typical periodontal bacteria. The generated 16SrDNA fragments were separated by denaturing gel. RESULTS: Although the sizes of the amplified DNA fragments were almost the same among the species, 16SrDNAs of the periodontal bacteria were distinguished according to their specific sequences. The microflora of clinical plaque samples were profiled by the PCR-DGGE method, and the dominant 16SrDNA bands were cloned and sequenced. Simultaneously, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia were detected by an ordinary PCR method. In the deep periodontal pockets, the bacterial community structures were complicated and P. gingivalis was the most dominant species, whereas the DGGE profiles were simple and Streptococcus or Neisseria species were dominant in the shallow pockets. The species-specific PCR method revealed the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in the clinical samples. However, corresponding bands were not always observed in the DGGE profiles, indicating a lower sensitivity of the DGGE method. CONCLUSION: Although the DGGE method may have a lower sensitivity than the ordinary PCR methods, it could visualize the bacterial qualitative compositions and reveal the major species of the plaque. The DGGE analysis and following sequencing may have the potential to be a promising bacterial examination procedure in periodontal diseases.
TI  - Genomics of oral bacteria.
AB  - Advances in bacterial genetics came with the discovery of the genetic code, followed by the development of recombinant DNA technologies. Now the field is undergoing a new revolution because of investigators' ability to sequence and assemble complete bacterial genomes. Over 200 genome projects have been completed or are in progress, and the oral microbiology research community has benefited through projects for oral bacteria and their non-oral-pathogen relatives. This review describes features of several oral bacterial genomes, and emphasizes the themes of species relationships, comparative genomics, and lateral gene transfer. Genomics is having a broad impact on basic research in microbial pathogenesis, and will lead to new approaches in clinical research and therapeutics. The oral microbiota is a unique community especially suited for new challenges to sequence the metagenomes of microbial consortia, and the genomes of uncultivable bacteria.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult Sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  - Little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. We assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult Sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. A pooled subgingival plaque sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. Whole genomic DNA probes and the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. Using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold, between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. The percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. Miswak users harbored significantly higher Streptococcus intermedius, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Veillonella parvula, Actinomyces israelii, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower Selenomonas sputigena, Streptococcus salivarius, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. Probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and V. parvula than those 4-5 mm. Our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of synthetic human B defensin-2 against periodontal bacteria.
AB  - The oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges  that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. Human B Defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight, which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. This peptide has a broad antimicrobial spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Therefore, it is thought that hBD-2 plays an important role as one of natural immunities to bacterial infection. However, its activity is inhibited by body fluids such as serum. The aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or serum. The antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 was tested against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Escherichia coli. Antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were performed in vitro. The antibacterial activity of hBD-2 was approximately equal to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, the activity of hBD-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained in the presence of 20% serum. Our results suggest the possibility that synthetic hBD-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Periodontal microbiota and clinical periodontal status in a rural sample in southern Thailand.
AB  - We sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in Thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural China. We examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. Checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. The prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2% and 100%. Discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly 67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. High colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% Confidence Limits (CL) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% CL 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. The data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.
TI  - Effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils.
AB  - The effects of safrole on the defensive functions of human neutrophils were examined. At the concentrations employed in this study, safrole did not significantly affect the viability of peripheral blood neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. However, exposure of neutrophils to safrole inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans, in a dose dependent manner. In addition, safrole inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that safrole reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. Inhibition of the defensive functions of neutrophils may be one possible mechanism by which safrole compromises the oral health.
TI  - Effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth of plaque bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. In view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. METHODS: Human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (Aza), cyclosporin A (CsA), tacrolimus (Tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (Myc). PGE subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for PGE subset 2 (clone E2R1). The protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. A redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. In an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (A. viscosus T14V, S. oralis H1, S. mutans 10449, C. gingivalis DR2001, A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4, and M. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. RESULTS: In comparison with the controls, the PGE subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with Aza, and by 77.0% with CsA. The protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for Aza and 17.0% for Myc. Furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (Aza 70.7%, CsA 78.2%, Myc 69.8%, Tac 64.0%). The most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for CsA at values ranging from 21.0% (S. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (A. viscosus T14V) growth inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: The present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. Furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.
TI  - Opsonization of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans by immunoglobulin G antibody reactive with phosphorylcholine.
AB  - We used two strains of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, one bearing phosphorylcholine (PC) (strain D045D-40) and one devoid of PC antigens (strain DB03A-42), as well as a nonencapsulated strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae (strain 39937), to examine the opsonic properties of physiological concentrations (</=30 micro g/ml) of purified human anti-PC immunoglobulin G (IgG). Anti-PC bound to both A. actinomycetemcomitans DO45D-40 and S. pneumoniae 39937 and induced superoxide anion production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils; induction of the oxidative burst was inhibited by antibodies to either CD16 or CD32. Thus, anti-PC IgG at concentrations present in most human sera promotes the opsonization of PC-expressing strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans in the absence of complement, implying that anti-PC may be a protective antibody against such strains of bacteria.
TI  - Stress and the periodontal diseases: effects of catecholamines on the growth of periodontal bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. Noradrenaline and adrenaline, which are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. The aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. We established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees C. We assessed organism growth by optical density (OD(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. Test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. We observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. The most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in Actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), Actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), Eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and Campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). We also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for Porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and Bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). Responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. Individual organisms from different microbial complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. Such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.
TI  - [An in vitro study of the action of kola nitida on bacterial strains implicated in dental caries and periodontal diseases].
AB  - The Nitida Kola is a substance extracted from the kolanut. In West Africa its use by chewing is widespread among the Manding people. It's said to have tonic, stimulant and aphrodisiac characteristics and even recent studies have shown that it has antibacterial characteristics. The aim of this study is to make an estimation of the Nitida Kola's effects on different bacterial species involved in the two main oral and dental pathologies (teeth decays and periodontal illnesses). The obtained results indicate that the kola extract is not effectual against the tried-out bacteria at regular dose used by chewing.
TI  - [Research on inhibition of sodium fluoride on five subgingival bacteria in vitro].
AB  - This in vitro study was aimed at observing inhibition action of fluoride on 5 common periodontal bacteria in subgingival microflora. The liquid media two-fold dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of sodium fluoride (NaF) to 9 strains of bacteria representing the main periodontopathic species(P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedius) and the periodontal beneficial species (S. sanguis) and 1 strain of S. sorbrinus. The results showed that all the bacteria were inhibited at different concentration of NaF. The MIC values ranged from 128 micrograms/ml for P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans, 256 micrograms/ml for S. sorbrinus, 1024 micrograms/ml for P. intermedius to 2048-4096 micrograms/ml for S. sanguis. The results suggest that NaF can also be used as a periodontal anti-bacterium agent and those preparations containing about 1000 micrograms/ml fluoride can be used effectively against the periodontopathic bacteria without disturbing the local ecological balance.
TI  - Permeability of Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Through guided tissue regeneration membranes and their effects on attachment of periodontal ligament cells.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial colonization on barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) may adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purposes of this study were: 1) to compare the invasion of Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans through 3 GTR membranes, composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE; non-resorbable), a glycolide fiber composite, and type I collagen (both bioabsorbable), and 2) to explore the effects of bacteria on the attachment of periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts onto these membranes. METHODS: Bacterial permeability was analyzed using a tube capped with a GTR membrane as a septum and filled with media. The tube was then placed in a bigger tube inoculated with S. mutans or A. actinomycetemcomitans. The passage of bacteria through the membranes into the inner tube was monitored. For cellular attachment experiments, primary human PDL cells were placed onto the GTR membranes with or without bacteria. Attached cells were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. RESULTS: The ePTFE membrane had the best barrier effects followed by the collagen membrane and then the glycolide fiber composite membrane. Moreover, S. mutans passed through these membranes faster than A. actinomycetemcomitans. The attachment of PDL cells on the 3 membranes was also varied. The ePTFE membrane was the worst substrate for PDL fibroblast attachment. Moreover, both bacteria influenced the cellular attachment on the GTR membranes. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the behavior of 3 GTR membranes penetrated by S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans were demonstrated. The results suggest that attachment of PDL cells was affected on bacterial-contaminated GTR membranes, which may alter healing following membrane exposure.
TI  - Microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  - The placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. The purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. Thirty-two metallic brackets and 24 ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. Two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. Sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. Bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization, which uses DNA probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing S mutans and L acidophilus spp counts. Mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. This study showed higher mean counts of Treponema denticola, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, Streptococcus anginosus, and Eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter showae, and Selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.
TI  - Oral infections: impact on human health, well-being, and health-care costs.
AB  - Both caries and periodontal disease as well as many diseases of the mucous membranes, tongue, and salivary glands are infectious. If left untreated or inadequately treated, they have profound systemic as well as local effects. Maintenance of oral health goes beyond the physiological needs of proper nutritional intake and protection of the oral tissues. It also includes protection against oral sources of systemic infection and encompasses a range of social and psychological attributes. The rising expectations of patients in the pursuit of comfort and esthetics has provided evidence of the oral contribution to quality of life. Oral infections and their sequela account for the major portion of annual dental expenditures.
TI  - Salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in Sudanese adults.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult Sudanese subjects. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. The periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. Whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using whole genomic DNA probes. RESULTS: A high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or = 105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. Between 12% and 16% of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, P. intermedia, C. rectus and E. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum, respectively. There were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. Presence of > or = 105 L. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). There were significantly higher levels of A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. melaninogenica, C. rectus, P. micros, V. parvula, S. mutans, S. anginosus, A. israelii, C. sputigena, and C. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, S. sputigena, E. corrodens, L. acidophilus, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. oralis, and S. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. CONCLUSIONS: : The findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. This is the first report that the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.
TI  - In vivo induction of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse tissue by Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease initiated by a multitude of bacteria. Persistent infection leads to generation of various inflammatory mediators, resulting in tissue destruction and osteoclastic resorption of the alveolar bone. This study describes a novel in vivo murine calvarial model to assess the effects of oral pathogens on the expression of three proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha] which are involved in bone resorption. We chose Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans as prototype oral pathogens. We also tested the effects of Streptococcus gordonii, an oral commensal supragingival microorganism, considered a non-pathogen. Live bacteria were injected into subcutaneous tissue overlying the parietal bone of mice calvaria for 6 days. At the end of the experimental period, tissues overlying the calvaria were removed and analyzed for proinflammatory cytokine expression by Northern blotting. Cytokine mRNA was not detected in the tissue over the calvaria of control animals. In contrast, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans elicited mRNA expression of all three cytokines, TNFalpha being the highest (TNFalpha > > IL-1beta > IL-6). P. gingivalis was more potent than A. actinomycetemcomitans in inducing cytokine expression. In contrast, S. gordonii induced only low levels of mRNA for IL-1beta and TNFalpha but no IL-6 mRNA induction. These results suggest that oral microorganisms with access to host tissues elicit a battery of proinflammatory cytokines. There were clear differences in profiles and, interestingly, a commensal bacterium also stimulated bone resorptive cytokine expression in host tissues.
TI  - Simultaneous measurement of the viability, aggregation, and live and dead adherence of Streptococcus crista, Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in human saliva in relation to indices of caries, dental plaque and periodontal disease.
AB  - Salivary proteins have multiple functions and many share similar functions, which may be why it has been difficult to relate variations in their concentrations to oral health and ecology. An alternative is to focus on variations in the major functions of saliva. An hydroxyapatite-coated microplate model has been developed that simultaneously measures saliva-promoted bacterial viability, bacterial aggregation, and live and dead bacterial adherence, while simulating oral temperature and shearing forces from swallowing. That model was applied to resting whole and stimulated parotid saliva from 149 individuals, using representative strains of Streptococcus crista, S. mutans, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Two major factors were defined by multivariate analysis (this was successful only for whole-saliva). One factor was correlated with aggregation, live adherence and dead adherence for all three strains; the other was correlated with total viability of all three strains. Participants were grouped <25th percentile and >75th percentile for each factor. Those groups were compared for clinical indices of oral health. Caries scores were significantly lower in those with high scores for aggregation-adherence, regardless of whether total viability scores were low or high. Live bacteria always predominated on surfaces when live and dead adherence scores were expressed as ratios. However, participants with high scores for aggregation-adherence showed significantly more dead adherent bacteria than those with low scores (these ratios were uncorrelated with total viability). This finding may indicate that extreme differences in the ability to kill bacteria on surfaces can influence caries risk.
TI  - Parotid salivary S-IgA antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  - Persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory IgA (S-IgA) or parotid S-IgA reactive with selected oral microorganisms. Parotid saliva samples were obtained from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. Output levels of total S-IgA and of specific S-IgA reactive with cell extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of ELISA. Smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total S-IgA, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. Parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific S-IgA at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. The present observations indicate that total S-IgA and bacteria-specific S-IgA in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in Sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the periodontal status of patients with Sjogren's Syndrome (SS), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of SS patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. METHODS: 8 primary SS and 10 secondary SS patients were examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. All patients were diagnosed by the European Community Criteria. Control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. The comparison of clinical status was made in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. Microbiological assays of the subgingival dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (Periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (PA) and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, Streptococcus oralis). RESULTS: The occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. No significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary SS patients for the PA test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. CONCLUSION: No significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or secondary SS patients compared with that of control subjects. The results of the present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with SS do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota of indigenous Indians of Central America.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous Indians in Guatemala, Central America. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. Plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. RESULTS: Plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). Streptococcus sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. At the subject level, Actinomyces naeslundii and Peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSION: There was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. These latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. However, in this population where extensive plaque deposits and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.
TI  - Oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  - Several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. Resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. Preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. In addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. The resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to respiratory infection. Further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Effect of the enamel matrix derivative Emdogain on the growth of periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Emdogain (EMD), used for periodontal regeneration, on the growth of periodontal pathogens like Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia. For comparison, we studied the effect of EMD on several microbes associated with other oral diseases as well as its effect on non-pathogenic oral inhabitants. METHODS: Freshly prepared EMD or its vehicle propylene glycol alginate (PGA) alone were added to calibrated suspensions of microbes. As a control, imitating the post-surgical subgingival situation after flap closure, a serum/NaCl-solution mixture was used. Aliquots for growth assays were taken at scheduled times for calculation of colony-forming units and cell densities over an observation period of 24 h. Additionally, EMD was spotted onto selected, newly seeded microbes growing on agar plates to see if growth inhibition zones could be produced. RESULTS: The study revealed a marked inhibitory effect of EMD on the growth of the gram-negative periodontal pathogens. A. actinomycetemcomitans showed a significant decrease (p=0.012) in viable counts after 24 h when EMD was added at baseline. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia also showed a marked growth reduction in the presence of EMD and in these cultures no viable microbes could be detected anymore after 24 h. In contrast, no significant growth inhibition was observed in gram-positive bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that EMD has a positive effect on the composition of bacterial species in the post-surgical periodontal wound, by selectively restricting growth of periopathogens that could hamper the wound healing and reduce the outcome of regenerative procedures.
TI  - Chlorhexidine varnishes: a review.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Of all chemical plaque control agents, chlorhexidine digluconate has  proven to be the most effective and safe. Since 1964, varnishes have been used for local delivery of fluor and are reported to be an effective and easy to use vehicle. During the past decade, varnishes for local delivery of antimicrobial agents have been developed and investigated in vitro and in vivo. AIM: In this paper, the existing literature on the use of 3 different chlorhexidine varnishes in different fields in dentistry is reviewed. METHOD: In vitro results concerning the release of the antimicrobial agents are compared for the 3 different varnish formulations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Clinical reports on the efficacy of controlled-release systems in altering cariogenic and periodontopathic microflora are summarized.
TI  - The microbiota of young children from tooth and tongue samples.
AB  - This study determined the frequency with which 38 microbial species were detected in 171 randomly selected children from 6 to 36 months of age. Children were sampled and dental caries measured. Oral samples were assayed by means of a checkerboard DNA probe assay. The detection frequencies from tongue samples in children under 18 mos were: S. mutans 70%, S. sobrinus 72%, P. gingivalis 23%, B. forsythus 11%, and A. actinomycetemcomitans 30%, with similar detection frequencies in children over 18 mos. Thus, S. mutans and the periodontal pathogens, P. gingivalis and B. forsythus, were detected even in the youngest subjects. Species associated with caries included S. mutans (children ages 18-36 mos) and A. israelii (children ages < 18 mos), the latter species possibly reflecting increased plaque in children with caries. Species detection from tooth and tongue samples was highly associated, with most species detected more frequently from tongue than from tooth samples in children under 18 mos, suggesting that the tongue was a potential microbial reservoir.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a chitooligosaccharide mixture against Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antibacterial activity of  a chitooligosaccharide mixture (MW 2000-30000 Da) with a deacetylation degree of 91.5% against two representative oral pathogens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans. A 0.1% concentration of the chitooligosaccharides (derived from the exoskeletons of marine crustaceans) was used to estimate antibacterial activity. Approximately 2 logcolony forming units (CFU)/ml of A. actinomycetemcomitans were inactivated by 0.1% chitosan after 30 min, while 120 min exposure inactivated about 4.5 logCFU/ml of this organism. In contrast, the level of inactivation against S. mutans was less than 0.5 logCFU/ml after an exposure of up to 120 min. Electron microscopy showed that the exposure of A. actinomycetemcomitans to the chitooligosaccharides resulted in the disruption of cell membranes and that it could be considered for the treatment of periodontal diseases associated with A. actinomycetemcomitans.
TI  - Efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (II). Effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (Crest Complete) or power (Braun 3D Plaque Remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. METHODS: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. At baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. After random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. Clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. Significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the Quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. Streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while Streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. Mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. Major reductions occurred in both groups for A. naeslundii, A. israelii/gerencseriae, Peptostreptococcus micros, Veillonella parvula, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis and S. constellatus/intermedius. All taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. The reductions in prevalence were greater for A. naeslundii, S. constellatus/intermedius, V. parvula, A. israelii/gerencseriae, S. mitis/oralis/sanguis, P. micros, Streptococcus mutans and P. intermedia/nigrescens. Mean prevalence was decreased more for Porphyromonas gingivalis, Campylobacter rectus/showae, Treponema denticola and Bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. CONCLUSIONS: The major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the subgingival microbiota. Counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. This reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. Further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  - Antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (PC) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. Previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain PC as determined by reactivity with PC-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (IgG) G anti-PC are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. These data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-PC responses. Recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for PC are elevated in ApoE-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDL) (oxLDL) in atherosclerotic plaques. These data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-PC could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxLDL, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. We therefore examined the ability of human anti-PC to bind to PC-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-PC to PC-bearing Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Our results indicated that PC-bearing strains of Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguis, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed up to 80% of anti-PC IgG antibody from human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound to a PC-bearing strain of A. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a PC-negative strain. OxLDL also absorbed anti-PC from human sera, and oxLDL but not LDL reacted with up to 80% of the anti-PC in human sera. Furthermore, purified anti-PC bound directly to oxLDL but not to LDL. The data indicate that PC-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxLDL. We propose that PC-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to PC that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.
TI  - Mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. This implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. Although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. However, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. The subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. This localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. These patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. RESULTS: The prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. The mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS: The subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.
TI  - Molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  - Fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. Bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. Fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. Type I fimbriae and P pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. Type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type II secretion system. Curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. Fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. Oral pathogens, such as Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. These fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. corrodens have Type 4-like fimbriae, whereas P. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. To date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, Actinomyces naeslundii and Streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. The putative major fimbrial subunits, FimA and FimP of A. naeslundii and Fap1 of S. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. The presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in Fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. Based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both S. parasanguis and A. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. The model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.
TI  - Move of adults with mental retardation from institutions to community-based living: changes in the oral microbiological flora.
AB  - In the Western world, the policy of deinstitutionalization and integration of individuals with mental retardation is generally accepted. We tested the hypothesis that de-institutionalization may lead to changes of habits with a potential to influence oral health. When 57 adults with mental retardation moved from an institution to community-based living, their oral hygiene habits, gingival bleeding, and a three-day food record were registered one month before and 9 and 21 months after the move. Mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in saliva, P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans in supragingival plaque, and C. albicans on mucous membranes were analyzed. After 21 months of community-based living, fewer persons showed high classes of mutans streptococci, growth of P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, and high frequency of sucrose intake, and more subjects showed growth of C. albicans. In a short perspective, the indicators of oral diseases suggest an unchanged or lower risk of oral diseases after the de-institutionalization of individuals with moderate or severe mental retardation.
TI  - A microbiological study of Papillon-Lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  - AIM: To analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. METHODS: Bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. Some isolates were also subjected to partial 16S rDNA sequencing. Plaque samples were also assayed for the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: The culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly Capnocytophaga spp and Streptococcus spp. The latter included S. constellatus, S. oralis, and S. sanguis. Other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. The aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. Anaerobic species included Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica, and P. nigrescens, as well as Peptostreptococcus spp. ELISA detected P gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. Prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PLS have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. However, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with PLS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  - Metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. Silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. Copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. In contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/mL produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (CFU)/mL or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella denticola, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, Campylobacter gracilis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. In comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. A silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/mL produced log10 reductions in CFU/mL of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against P. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket. These results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.
TI  - Increased susceptibility to gingival colonization by specific HACEK microbes in children with congenital heart disease.
AB  - It is well established that infective endocarditis (IE) involving the HACEK (Hemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacter, Eikenella, Kingella) group of microbes occurs in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD) and in those with prosthetic grafts. Dental caries and gingival disease have been presumed to be the focus of microbial shedding. The purpose of this study was to determine if children with CHD had a more severe gingival inflammatory condition and harbored the HACEK group of microbes to a greater extent than normal children. Two groups of 12 age and sex matched children were selected for this study. The experimental group consisted of twelve children with CHD, 1-1/2 to 8 years of age. The control group consisted of 12 healthy children 2 to 8 years of age. Each child had a gingival index score recorded as described by Massler. Subgingival cultures were obtained. Gingival samples were cultured for HACEK microbes and total Streptococcus (spp) using standard techniques. Fisher's exact test was performed with significance defined at P < 0.05. Children with CHD had more severe gingival inflammatory index than the control group (P < 0.05). 8/12 CHD patient had Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) as compared with 2/12 controls (P < 0.05). Furthermore, all cyanotic CHD patients (4/4) had A.a. whereas, only 2/12 controls did (P < 0.05). 4/12 CHD patients harbored Eikenella corrodens (E.c.) compared to 1/12 controls (N.S.). There was no significant difference in colonization with E.c. or A.a. between cyanotic and acyanotic patients. No significant difference in total Streptococcus (spp) was found between the two groups. This study suggests that children with CHD have a more severe gingival inflammatory index and are colonized with specific HACEK microbes more so than normal children.
TI  - Smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  - AIM: The present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. The population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. METHODS: Microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. The checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, F. nucleatum, T. denticola, P. micros, C. rectus, E. corrodens, S. noxia and S. intermedius. RESULTS: Using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. Using score 4 as cutoff, contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. No significant differences in detection rates were observed between smokers and non-smokers. Logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. The lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported the indication of a limited influence of smoking. CONCLUSION: Smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.
TI  - Studies on oral health in mentally retarded adults.
AB  - During the last decades, a new policy involving normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (MR) individuals has been accepted in Sweden. Consequently, many institutions have been closed and an increased number of people with MR are now integrated into the Swedish community. The general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for MR adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and interproximal bone loss were investigated in a group of MR adults, aged 21-40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. The studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of MR, and were followed during 8.5 years (Papers I, II and VI). Incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised MR individuals (Paper III). In connection with the closing-down of an institution for MR adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (Papers IV and V). RESULTS: Less restrictive living arrangements and mild forms of MR were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with MR. After 8.5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild MR and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other MR adults. With the exception of subjects with Down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8.5 years was similar or lower compared to normal Swedish populations. Institutionalised MR subjects had lost an average of 3.72 teeth during 10 years. Periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. Persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10-year period compared to other MR individuals. The proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of P. intermedia/P. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. The oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. A simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. CONCLUSIONS: Less restrictive living and a mild degree of MR were correlated to a high caries prevalence. Subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with Down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. However, compared to normal Swedish populations, the MR subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health.
TI  - Assessment of periradicular microbiota by DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - In the present study the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. Thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (+/- SD) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in Group 2 (P < 0.001). The majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group 1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.
TI  - The clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (ORN) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (EOP) patients. METHODS: Two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting EOP. All patients received oral hygiene instruction (OHI), supragingival scaling and ORN. Subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) was carried out only in scaled sites. Bacterial samples were taken at baseline (BL) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). One more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after SRP. RESULTS: One week following SRP (scaled sites) Gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while Gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. After ORN administration, P. gingivalis, P. denticola, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, C. rectus, and S. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. A statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. loescheii, B. forsythus, and C. rectus and a pronounced increase of S. milleri, S. oralis, and S. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. A sustained reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. CONCLUSIONS: ORN combined with SRP effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that ORN is effective adjunct in the treatment of EOP deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.
TI  - Microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND, AIMS: The purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). METHODS: A total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. The counts (levels), % DNA probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. Significance of differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: All 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. Actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 Actinomyces species. Supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts of Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Neisseria mucosa, Streptococcus gordonii, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. Subgingival plaque samples presented significantly higher counts of Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Bacteroides forsythus and Porphykromonas gingivalis. Subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as Actinomyces species. Suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival samples were negative for the same species. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
TI  - Coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of Coptidis Rhizoma (CR), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CR extract was prepared by boiling CR in water for 2 h. Alkaloids contained in CR extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antibacterial activity of CR extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (IC50). RESULTS: CR extract inhibited the growth of Actinomyces naeslundii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at MIC of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (MIC: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. The major active component of CR extract was berberine (Ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of CR extract. CR extract and Ber were bacteriostatic at the MICs against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the MICs. Ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans. CONCLUSION: CR extract and Ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. These results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Effects of areca nut extracts on the functions of human neutrophils in vitro.
AB  - Aqueous extracts of ripe areca nut without husk (ripe ANE) and fresh and tender areca nut with husk (tender ANE) were examined for their effects on the defensive functions of human neutrophils. Exposure of peripheral blood neutrophils to ripe ANE and tender ANE inhibited their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Streptococcus mutans, in a dose-dependent manner. At the concentrations tested, ripe and tender ANEs did not significantly affect the viability of neutrophils as verified by their ability to exclude trypan blue dye. However, both ANEs inhibited the production of bactericidal superoxide anion by neutrophils as measured by cytochrome c reduction. Moreover, the ripe ANE inhibited neutrophils more effectively than did tender ANE. Arecoline, a major alkaloid of areca nut, only exhibited an inhibitory effect on the functions of neutrophils when high concentrations were used. Therefore, arecoline could not be used to explain the inhibitory effects observed for ANEs. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ripe and tender ANEs reduced the antibacterial activity and the superoxide anion production of neutrophils. This effect may contribute to a less efficient elimination of bacteria from the periodontal environment. Inhibition of the antimicrobial functions of neutrophils may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and this may be one possible mechanism by which areca nut compromises the oral health of users of areca nut products.
TI  - Large-scale synthesis and functional elements for the antimicrobial activity of defensins.
AB  - Human neutrophil defensins, and their analogues incorporating anionic, hydrophobic or cationic residues at the N- and C-termini, were synthesized by solid-phase procedures. The synthetic defensins were examined for their microbicidal activity against Candida albicans, two Gram-negative bacteria (Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis) and two Gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus mutans). The human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1) and HNP2 were found to be potent candidacidal agents. HNP3, which differs by one amino acid at the N-terminus of its sequence, was totally inactive. The Gram-negative bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis and the Gram-positive bacteria S. gordonii and S. mutans were insensitive to human defensins. However, the insertion of two basic residues, such as arginine, at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of HNP2 significantly enhanced antifungal and antibacterial activity. The addition of anionic residues, such as aspartic acid, at the N- and C-termini rendered the molecule totally inactive. The presence of two hydrophobic amino acids, such as valine, at the N-terminus of HNP2 and of two basic arginine residues at its C-terminus resulted in molecules that were optimally active against these oral pathogens. The results suggest that the N- and C-terminal residues in defensin peptides are the crucial functional elements that determine their microbicidal potency. The three-dimensional structure of all defensins constitutes the same amphiphilic beta-sheet structure, with the polar face formed by the N- and C-terminal residues playing an important role in defining microbicidal potency and the antimicrobial spectrum. The enhanced microbicidal activity observed for defensin peptides with two basic residues at both the N- and C-termini could be due to optimization of the amphiphilicity of the structure, which could facilitate specific interactions with the microbial membranes.
TI  - Synthesis, microbicidal activity, and solution structure of the dodecapeptide from bovine neutrophils.
AB  - The dodecapepetide sequence R-L-C-R-I-V-V-I-R-V-C-R with a disulfide bridge between the cysteine residues found in bovine neutrophils was synthesized by solid-phase procedures. Its antimicrobial activity against oral microorganisms such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus gordonii was examined, and its structural features were examined by CD and determined by two-dimensional (2D) nmr. The strains P. gingivalis (W50 and 381), A. actinomycetemcomitans (Y4 and 67), S. gordonii (DL1), and S. mutans (GS5) are found to be highly sensitive to this peptide at 2-2.5 microM concentrations, suggesting that the dodecapeptide is a potent antibiotic for oral pathogens. The weak negative n-sigma* band observed at approximately 265-270 nm in the CD spectra of this peptide provides evidence for the presence of a disulfide bridge. The negative n-pi* band at approximately 200 nm and the positive pi-pi* band at 185 nm suggest a folded structure for this peptide. The negative n-pi* shifts from 200 to 206 nm with an increase in intensity in dipalmitoylphosphotidylcholine vesicles, suggesting that the peptide might associate to form higher order aggregates in lipid medium. The assignment of backbone and side-chain proton resonances has been accomplished by the combined analysis of 2D total correlated and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts and (1)H-(2)H exchange effect on amide NH resonances indicate the involvement of amide NH groups of Cys3, Ile5, Ile8, Val10, and Arg12 in intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The coupling constant (J(NH-C(alpha)H)) values, the set of medium-, short-, and long-range nuclear Overhauser effects, and the results of restrained structure calculation using the distance geometry algorithm for nmr applications provide evidence for a folded, loop-like structure with a type I (III) beta-turn involving Ile5, Val6, Val7, and Ile8, and two antiparallel beta-strands involving the N-terminal Arg1, Leu2, Cys3, and Val4 and the C-terminal Arg9, Val10, Cys11, and Arg12 residues. The structure of the dodecapeptide mimics the amphiphilic structure of large 30-35 residue defensins and the peptide appears to exhibit similar antimicrobial potency.
TI  - Tenacious adhesion of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain CU1000 to salivary-coated hydroxyapatite.
AB  - Adherence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans to hard-tissue surfaces was evaluated by comparing a phenotypically stable, well-maintained clinical isolate (strain CU1000) to Streptococcus gordonii G9B, an extensively studied oral-colonizing bacterium. Standard innocula of radiolabelled bacteria were added to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (SHA) and the ratio of bound to unbound cells counted. Several other clinical isolates as well as laboratory strain Y4 were studied. In other experiments, cell detachment from SHA was compared in static and shaking vessels to calculate controlled desorption of cells over time. A sonic-displacement assay was used to measure avidity of binding to HA and SHA. To better define the attachment properties of CU1000, bacteria were treated with a variety of agents including detergents, salts and enzymes before or after incubation with SHA. Results indicated that CU1000 bound better than G9B (a minimum of 10-fold greater; p < or = 0.05) and did not desorb from SHA, while G9B desorbed to equilibrium in 4 h. Furthermore, Langmuir isotherm calculations indicated that, unlike G9B, CU1000 did not follow second-order adsorption kinetics and thus did not achieve saturation. In addition, of the agents tested only periodate reduced attachment and resulted in detachment of CU1000 from surfaces. These experiments suggest that clinical isolates of A. actinomycetemcomitans possess unique binding properties that promote adsorption to and impede desorption from SHA. The characteristics described for the actinobacillus in this study have been previously underestimated, appear to be mediated by glycoconjugates, and may resemble attachment described for several biofilm-forming, non-oral pathogens.
TI  - Periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Behcet's disease.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. Recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. The aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. METHODS: Thirty-three patients with Behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. Serum IgG antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. RESULTS: Significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with Behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including Actinomyces viscosus, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus oralis, Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter rectus, and Prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with Behcet's disease than in controls (P <0.001-0.05). In contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 compared to controls (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the patients with Behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. Decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in Behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.
TI  - Bacteriostatic effects of hyaluronic acid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This investigation is one of a series of projects seeking to ascertain whether hyaluronic acid (HA) is therapeutically effective in tissue regeneration procedures. The rationale for these investigations is to test the hypothesis that HA can serve as a bioabsorbable carrier for other substrates as well as itself actively promote the regeneration of tissue. METHODS: In this paper, we report on the bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties of 3 molecular weight formulations of recombinant HA (low, 141 kD; medium, 757 kD; and high, 1,300 kD) on selected oral and non-oral microorganisms in the planktonic phase. Three concentrations of each HA formulation were screened, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml, using a standard broth culture assay. RESULTS: Recombinant HA exerted varied bacteriostatic effects on all the bacterial strains tested depending on its molecular weight (MW) and concentration. The high concentrations of the medium MW HA had the greatest bacteriostatic effect, particularly on the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella oris, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes strains. The 1.0 mg/ml concentration of high MW HA had the greatest overall bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of all 6 bacterial strains tested. Among the bacterial strains studied, HA was found to have no bactericidal effects, regardless of concentration or molecular weight. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that HA in the MW range of 1,300 kD may prove beneficial in minimizing bacterial contamination of surgical wounds when used in guided tissue regeneration surgery.
TI  - The microbiota of periodontal pockets with different depths in therapy-resistant  periodontitis.
AB  - This study presents the composition of the cultivable microbiota colonising periodontal pockets of different depths among 2 patient-groups classified as non-responsive (NR-group; 11 participants) or responsive (R-group; 10 participants) to periodontal treatment. Microbiological samples from three types of pocket (< 4 mm deep A-samples; 4-5 mm B-samples; > 5 mm C-samples) were analysed by cultural methods for putative periodontitis pathogens, microbial groups constituting > or = 5% of the total cultivable flora and opportunistic pathogens. Actinomyces naeslundii, A. israelii, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, anaerobic streptococci and facultative anaerobic streptococci were most prevalent. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric rods and yeasts were less prevalent. The periodontitis pathogens Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium spp, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Peptostreptococcus micros constituted together (on average) < or = 23% of the viable counts in the A- and B-samples of both patient groups and in the C-samples of the R-group. In the C-samples of the NR-group their mean counts were 45%. Correlations were found between smoking habits and the five pathogens in the C-samples and in pooled pocket depth samples. The results show that groups of periodontopathogens should be considered a causal factor in therapy-resistant periodontitis. Further, smoking and deep pockets can enhance a shift in the balance of the subgingival microflora predisposing a site to disease and a susceptible host may be the pre-requisite to therapy-resistant periodontitis.
TI  - The importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  - Cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization of various oral bacterial species. Bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. The properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance. Among others, Porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. The fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kDa fimbrillin proteins. DNA sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fimA) from nine strains of P. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fimA, while retaining common immunochemical specificities. P. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. Fimbriae of Prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of Prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., Actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. Fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral Actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. These fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. Taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.
TI  - Neutrophil response and microbiological findings around teeth and dental implants.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the neutrophil response, measured as both functional and antigenic elastase, around teeth and titanium implants and to relate these findings to the microbiota. The 31 patients included in the study had been treated successfully for total or partial edentulism with titanium implants. Crevicular fluid and microbiological samples were taken from 3 sites: 1) crevices around teeth and 2) implants in 16 partially edentulous patients and 3) crevices around implants in 15 edentulous patients. All sites sampled showed similar degrees of inflammation assessed by gingival index and total protein concentration. The samples were analyzed for elastase activity and immunoreactive elastase. The elastase activity was significantly higher in crevices surrounding implants in partially edentulous patients compared with implants in edentulous patients. The antigenic elastase showed no difference among the 3 sites. Gram-positive cocci were the main bacterial species in all 3 groups. Edentulous patients tended to have lower frequency of black pigmenting anaerobes. No correlation of analyzed bacteria and elastase activity was found between the 3 sites. This study indicates that, despite a similar appearance of clinical parameters and absence of significant differences in the microbiota, the inflammation around implants in partially edentulous patients induces a stronger neutrophil response than does the inflammation around implants in edentulous patients.
TI  - Microbiological features and crevicular fluid aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity in early onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. Aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (AST) is one of the components of GCF that is released as a result of cell death. In this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (EOP) patients were first examined for the AST levels in GCF by the Periogard periodontal tissue monitor. To be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 AST positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (AST+, CIC+) and 1 AST negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (AST-, CIC-). In 15 EOP patients who met the entry criteria, 30 AST+, CIC+ sites (1st group) and 19 AST-, CIC- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. Certain microbial species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as Actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. Parallel to the AST levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). Within the scope of this study, AST activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. These findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of the AST test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those that are inflamed, but not progressing.
TI  - Oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  - The present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. Secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. For this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and 14 were non-smokers. After achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. Plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. Microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of Actinomyces species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Streptococcus species. At day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). The change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. Changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for Actinomyces species, C. rectus, F. nucleatum, and P. intermedia. Within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. No relationship with a single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. It is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profile of Papillon-Lefevre patients assessed by DNA-probes.
AB  - The prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridisation in a group of 12 Saudi-Arabian adolescents with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. A total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. The patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. All 12 patients harboured the putative bacterial pathogens P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, P. micros and S. intermedius while T. denticola, B. forsythus, P. nigrescens, E. corrodens, S. noxia and C. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. P. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for A. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. A number of the investigated species (B. forsythus, T. denticola, P. intermedia, C rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. On the other hand, bacteria such as A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were infrequently encountered at high levels in these subgingival samples. In conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a PLS-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. Bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. In an aqueous environment, Ca2+, Na+, PO4(3-) , and Si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in pH and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. Since these are factors that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass S53P4 on the oral microorganisms Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mutans, and Streptococcus sanguis. This was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass S53P4 in powder form. A. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within 10 min under the experimental conditions. A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and S. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. Also for S. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. Thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass S53P4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. Consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.
TI  - Expression of iron binding proteins and hemin binding activity in the dental pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to express a polypeptide immunologically related to the Neisseria gonorrhoeae FbpA iron binding protein. In addition, the expression of hitB and hitC homologs was detected by Northern blot analysis. This periodontal pathogen also expresses a polypeptide homologous to the 31-kDa Haemophilus influenzae protein, which shows amino acid sequence homology with the FimA and YfeA proteins from Streptococcus parasanguis and Yersinia pestis, respectively. Both A. actinomycetemcomitans protein homologs were located within the periplasmic space, and their synthesis was regulated by the iron and hemin concentration of the culture medium. Southern and Western blot analysis together with molecular cloning revealed the presence of a Fur-like repressor, which may control the iron regulation of gene expression in this bacterium. Cultivation in the presence of hemin or Congo red revealed the ability of this organism to bind hemin. This binding activity was further confirmed by isolating Escherichia coli DH5 alpha clones that produced red and brown colonies on agar plates containing Congo red and hemin, respectively, after transformation with an A. actinomycetemcomitans gene library.
TI  - The effect of herbal extracts in an experimental mouthrinse on established plaque and gingivitis.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. The herbal extract was a mixture of: Juniperus communis (juniper), Urtica dioca (nettle), Achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. In the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of Streptococcus mutans was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the following micro-organisms were tested: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mitis, Actynomyces viscosus, Actynomyces naeslundii, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella parvula. The MIC-values for A. viscosus and P. gingivalis were 100 mg/ml. The MIC-values for A. naeslundii and A. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). S. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a MIC value of 1 mg/ml. S. mutans, C. rectus, V. parvula, and F. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. No inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of S. mutans. For the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. As efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. The subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). The participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. After 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. The results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. In conclusion, the results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, Juniperus communis, Urtica dioca and Achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.

TI  - Periodontal status and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms in Sjogren's syndrome.
AB  - Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. Rapid bacterial plaque accumulation occurs in Sjogren's syndrome patients due to decreases in salivary flow rate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with Sjogren's syndrome and evaluate serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens, compared to healthy controls. Seventeen Sjogren's syndrome patients and 14 healthy subjects were included in the study. Plaque (PL), sulcular bleeding (SBI), periodontal index scores (PI), probing depths (PD), and total number of teeth were recorded. An ELISA was used to determine the serum IgG antibody level to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms. Significantly higher PL, SBI, PD, and PI scores, as well as an increased number of lost teeth were observed in patients with Sjogren's syndrome compared to healthy subjects (P <0.0001). Antibody levels to Streptococcus oralis were significantly lower in Sjogren's syndrome patients than controls (P <0.0002). These patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis compared to controls (P <0.006 to 0.0004). Our findings indicate that Sjogren's syndrome patients have established periodontal disease and serum antibody responses to oral microorganisms previously identified as periodontopathogens in systemically healthy subjects. These results suggest that Sjogren's syndrome may affect bacterial colonization in plaque and contribute to increased periodontal disease in this compromised population.
TI  - Salivary IgA responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and HIV infection status.
AB  - Levels of total IgA and specific IgA reactive with Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by ELISA in parotid saliva from HIV+ and HIV- persons with healthy gingiva (HG), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (CMP), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (NUP). When the HIV+ group was compared with the HIV- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary IgA concentration was higher in HIV+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total IgA output. HIV+ CMP displayed higher total IgA concentration as compared with HIV- CMP. No significant differences in specific IgA outputs and ratios were detected between HIV+ and HIV- subgroups with similar periodontal status. HIV+ NUP displayed increased specific IgA output towards S. mutans and increased specific IgA ratio values towards S. mutans, P. gingivalis and P. nigrescens as compared with HIV+ CMP, and increased specific IgA ratio values towards S. mutans and P. nigrescens as compared with HIV+ HG. No such differences were observed between the HIV- subgroups. In sum, salivary IgA responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and HIV infection, but are possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.
TI  - Oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  - This study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. Microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16S rRNA-based PCR identification methods. Streptococcal and Actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. In decreasing order of prevalence, Fusobacterium, enteric rods, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Capnocytophaga, Propionibacterium, yeasts, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Campylobacter rectus, Bacteroides forsythus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. The cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. PCR detection showed C. rectus and Eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. In decreasing order of prevalence, PCR identified Treponema denticola, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia, B. forsythus, and P. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. Tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. It appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.
TI  - Effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  - The present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. During the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. At a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. The deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. At baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. This information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. No professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. The subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. The members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice containing triclosan/copolymer (Total, Colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. The findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. In a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.
TI  - Comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern Cameroon.
AB  - Our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult Cameronians. The aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched Cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction. We also compared cultivation and the Affirm DP test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined and the results were compared statistically. Each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. Results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of the 18 bacterial species. The Gram-positive species Actinomyces naeslundii, Streptococcus mitis and Streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. Cultivation demonstrated P. gingivalis, B. forsythus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared to the checkerboard technique. Furthermore, the Affirm DP test detected P. gingivalis and B. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the Affirm DP test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the healthy and diseased adult Cameronians were similar to those reported for adults in the West and in some developing countries.
TI  - Reduced serum IgG reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in HIV-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  - Serum samples were obtained from 44 HIV-seropositive (HIV+) and 37 HIV-seronegative (HIV-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. Serum IgG and IgA reactivities towards Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis. Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of ELISA. HIV+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower IgG reactivities to the periodontal pathogens A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and F. nucleatum as compared with their HIV- counterparts (p < 0.05). Specific serum IgA reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for P. nigrescens where the HIV+ group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). The results indicate that HIV infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in HIV-infected patients.
TI  - "Checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The present study compared the "checkerboard" DNA-DNA hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect to the following species: Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides forsythus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus mutans. Species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled DNA probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial test panels. We found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data. If the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. The use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87. The checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. It was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.
TI  - The effect of smoking on serum IgG2 reactive with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  - High titers of serum IgG2 reactive with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are  present in early-onset periodontitis (EOP) patients and it appears that anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans may be protective. Smoking is associated with increased periodontal disease severity in generalized early-onset periodontitis (G-EOP) patients, but is not associated with periodontal disease severity in patients with localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP). Furthermore, smoking is associated with reduced serum IgG2 levels in black patients with G-EOP but not in those with LJP. Based on this selective effect of smoking, we hypothesized that smoking would be associated with a reduction of specific IgG2 reactive with A. actinomycetemcomitans in black G-EOP patients but not black LJP patients. In addition, we examined IgG2 responses to carbohydrate antigens from non-periodontal pathogens including Haemophilus influenzae b oligosaccharide antigen (Hib) and the Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen phosphocholine (PC). Smoking status was assessed from serum cotinine levels, and IgG2 specific for A. actinomycetemcomitans, Hib, and PC was assessed by ELISA. Our study revealed that smoking was correlated with a dramatic reduction in serum IgG2 anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans in G-EOP smokers but not in LJP smokers. In contrast, anti-Hib IgG2 and anti-PC IgG2 were not affected in either G-EOP or LJP patients. In short, these results indicate that smoking is associated with a reduction in serum IgG2 anti-A. actinomycetemcomitans in black G-EOP subjects, but IgG2 reactive with other antigens may not be reduced in G-EOP smokers.
TI  - The relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with Down's syndrome.
AB  - Gingival inflammation in Down's syndrome children (DS) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-DS children. Abnormalities in host response to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. However, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response to oral microorganisms in DS by age has not been determined. The objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. Sera were obtained from 75 DS subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified PMA Index (M-PMA). Antibody titers to Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg), Prevotella intermedia (Pi), Treponema denticola (Td), Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), Selenomonas sputigena (Sel), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), and Streptococcus mitis (Mi) were determined using the micro-ELISA. DS subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did normal children the same age. A significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, P < 0.0001) existed in the relationship between M-PMA score and plaque score for subjects in the G1 age group (deciduous dentition). At G1, the average antibody titers to Aa, Mi, and Fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. In addition, IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Fn, Sel, and Mi correlated significantly with the M-PMA scores in the G1 age group. There was a correlation between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. IgG antibody titers to Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi increased significantly with increasing M-PMA score. Furthermore, the IgG antibody titers to Pg were higher (P < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the DS no-disease group. The IgG antibody titers to Pg at G3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to G1 (preschool children). The IgM antibody titers to Aa at G3 were higher (P < 0.05) when compared to G1. This study suggests that colonization by Aa and Fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in DS patients under 5 years old. Colonization by Pg, Aa, Sel, and Mi in DS appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens isolates in a wound chamber model in rabbits.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 14 isolates identified as Prevotella intermedia or Prevotella nigrescens by serogrouping using monoclonal antibodies was compared in a tissue cage model in rabbits. Seven strains from periodontal abscesses, 5 strains from deep periodontal pockets and 2 strains from gingivitis were tested in the animal model comprising 6 Teflon tissue cages implanted on the back each of 34 rabbits. A total of 10(5)-10(8) cells of P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains were inoculated alone or together with either Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or Streptococcus mitis. Five strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis were used as a reference. The infectivity was recorded as pus formation and log viable count in aspirated material for 3, 7 and 14 days. None of the Prevotella strains inoculated in monoculture survived more than 3 days, and they had no capacity to produce abscess. P. intermedia or P. nigrescens strains in combination with A. actinomycetemcomitans produced abscesses in 33-100% and with S. mitis in 42-100%. No difference in abscess formation or log viable count in samples after 14 days was recorded between serogroup I (P. intermedia) and serogroup II and III (P. nigrescens). The infectivity of P. intermedia or P. nigresceas strains did not differ whether they were isolated from periodontal abscess, periodontal pocket or gingivitis. P. intermedia and P. nigrescens strains produced abscesses in combination with a facultative anaerobic strain and appears to have a similar pathogenicity in the wound chamber model in rabbits.
TI  - Extracts of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells in vitro.
AB  - In order to study the effects of sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and other oral-related bacteria, as well as Escherichia coli on bone formation, clone MC3T3-E1 cells, which have retained osteoblastic activity, were cultured with various bacterial extracts. The addition of the sonicated extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans decreased the alkaline phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent fashion over the concentration range of 1-1000 ng ml-1 compared with the control. By contrast, the sonicated extracts from other oral bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Streptococcus milleri and Streptococcus sanguis, and Escherichia coli did not decrease the alkaline phosphatase activity even in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 protein. The addition of Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans extracts that had been treated with heat and trypsin to the cell cultures also inhibited alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells, suggesting that inhibitory factors are not proteinaceous. Polymyxin B did not change the alkaline phosphatase activity in the cells treated with the extracts from Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, suggesting that the inhibitory activity of the extracts is not lipopolysaccharide. The inhibitory effect of both extracts was observed in the molecular mass over 290 kDa eluted from Sephadex G-200 column. The inhibitory substances of Prevotella intermedia were partially purified and showed broad band with estimated molecular weight of 170-190 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results indicate that Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans may play an important role in inhibiting bone formation as well as in stimulating bone resorption.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial activity of etchants used for a total etch technique.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of eight commercially available etchant materials and positive and negative controls as they came into contact with bacteria commonly found within the oral cavity. The following bacteria were used in this study: Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, and Actinobacillis actinomycetocomitants. The study was conducted in two parts: Part I--Etchants and controls placed within wells in agar plates; Part II--Enamel-dentin disks saturated with the etchants for 20 seconds and placed on the agar plates with the controls. Zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. The results of the study indicate that all of the etchants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested.
TI  - Myeloperoxidase isoform activities released by human neutrophils in response to dental and periodontal bacteria.
AB  - Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme released by polymorphonuclear leukocytes which has been used, experimentally, as an indicator of periodontal disease activity when measured in gingival crevicular fluid. There are three myeloperoxidase isoforms: MPO I, MPO II and MPO III. We examined the activities of myeloperoxidase isoforms released by neutrophils in response to serum-opsonized Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Streptococcus sanguis. Isoform activities were determined using intermediate-pressure liquid chromatography and microenzyme assay. A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated higher levels of myeloperoxidase release than any other oral bacteria unless pre-opsonized with serum (or protein-A-purified immunoglobulin) from an individual with localized juvenile periodontitis. Most oral bacteria stimulated the release of all myeloperoxidase isoforms with a profile enriched in MPO I and diminished in MPO III. Exceptionally, serum-opsonized A. actinomycetemcomitans stimulated myeloperoxidase isoform release in proportion to the neutrophil granule constituency with or without localized juvenile periodontitis serum pre-opsonization. Because myeloperoxidase isoform profiles reflect how neutrophils were stimulated, isoform analysis may refine future diagnostic tests based upon myeloperoxidase.
TI  - Bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  - Microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (GTR) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). The study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. In each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (P1, P2, M1, M2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). These teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). A 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with an external sling suture. With oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (A. actinomycetemcomitans, A. viscosus, B. melaninogenicus, F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, S. mutans, S. sanguis, Selenomonas sputigena, T. denticola, and T. vincentii) were present. Semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and Pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (P < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. These results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.
TI  - Effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of Streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  - Passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. However, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. In this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) and a monoclonal antibody (OMVU10) on the chain length and growth of Streptococcus sobrinus. During growth in broth S. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pAbs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pAbs did not influence the growth rate of S. sobrinus in broth. OMVU10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. In order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, S. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, Streptococcus oralis and Actinomyces viscosus. No effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. However, the morphology of the S. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pAbs and OMVU10. The colonies were less dense and chains of S. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. After growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. It was concluded that pAbs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of S. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas OMVU10 influenced the colony morphology of S. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo studies on salifluor/PVM/MA copolymer/NaF combination as an  antiplaque agent.
AB  - Salifluor (5-n-octanoyl-3'-trifluoromethyl-salicylanilide), a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent, was investigated for its ability to inhibit dental plaque formation. A combination of salifluor with PVM/MA copolymer and NaF was optimized for its antiplaque effect in mouthrinse and dentifrice formulations based on a series of both laboratory and clinical studies. It was found that salifluor, a highly hydrophobic compound, could not be adequately solubilized with the conventional amount of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), the most commonly used anionic surfactant in oral hygiene products. However, it was possible to prepare stable mouthrinse formulations using a mixed surfactant system containing both anionic and nonionic surfactants. The most suitable mixture was found to be a combination of SLS, Pluronic and Tauranol in a proportion of 1:1:1. This combination provided adequate stability and high antimicrobial activity as determined by in vitro microbiological tests. Addition of a PVM/MA copolymer to the formulation improved the adsorption and retention of salifluor on stimulated tooth surfaces in vitro (saliva coated hydroxyapatite disks) by almost two-fold and also increased the antiplaque efficacy in both laboratory and human clinical studies. It was also found that a non fluoride dentifrice containing a combination of salifluor and PVM/MA copolymer with a dicalcium phosphate dihydrate abrasive, was highly effective in reducing smooth surface and fissure caries in rats. The results of the present studies demonstrated that salifluor is an effective antiplaque agent in mouthrinse and dentifrice when carefully formulated to maximize its delivery and bioavailability on oral surfaces. They also illustrated the difficulties encountered in exploiting the antimicrobial efficacy of highly hydrophobic, nonionic antimicrobial agents such as salifluor in commonly used oral hygiene vehicles.
TI  - Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin-8 production in mononuclear cells stimulated by oral microorganisms.
AB  - Chemokines are a family of low-molecular-weight proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate recruitment of leukocytes. The chemokines interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) are relatively specific chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively. Chemokine expression contributes to the presence of different leukocyte populations observed in normal and pathologic states. In the present studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated by microbes (Candida albicans, Streptococcus mutans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) selected based upon their importance as oral pathogens. IL-8 and MCP-1 gene expression and protein release were determined by Northern blot (RNA blot) analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. C. albicans, P. gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans induced high levels of production of both MCP-1 and IL-8. S. mutans was a strong inducer of MCP-1, but it did not stimulate significant production of IL-8. C. albicans, S. mutans, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were 500 to 5,000 times more potent than P. gingivalis in terms of MCP-1 production. In general, the microbe-to-PBMC ratios required for maximum gene expression of MCP-1 were lower than those for IL-8. However, for actual protein release of MCP-1 versus IL-8, differences in the effects of various microbe concentrations were observed only for A. actinomycetemcomitans. These results demonstrate that different oral pathogens induce specific dose-dependent patterns of chemokine gene expression and release. Such patterns may help explain the immunopathology of oral infections, particularly with regard to inflammatory leukocyte recruitment.
TI  - Effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  - Although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. Studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic, Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, NJ) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. These studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria. These in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.
TI  - The interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. The reference bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (GF) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (E) from 2 such persons, HeLa cells (HeLa), and an amnion cell line (Amnion). The cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a Bioscreen robot analyzer (Labsystems, Finland). Results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  - Thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. Clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate PD measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. Baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. Microbial samples were taken from 11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. Levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. Standard deviations of replicate PD measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. Plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with PD change. Baseline and follow-up distributions of PD changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. Five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. Sites from 2 subjects showed PD increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. Species associated with putative active subjects included Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella parvula, Selenomonas noxia and Prevotella nigrescens. Streptococcus sanguis, S. gordonii and Peptostreptococcus micros were associated with inactive subjects. S. gordonii and S. oralis were associated with health, whereas P. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. Elevated serum antibodies were detected to A. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. The predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.
TI  - Response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and B. forsythus.
AB  - In a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or Augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either Ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. Since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified Widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: Augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. Treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for their content of 14 subgingival species including P. gingivalis, P. nigrescens, P. intermedia and B. forsythus using DNA probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species group. Because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. However, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. Low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. The mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. High test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving Augmentin (14.1). Periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with Augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. The greatest proportion of gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. Overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in C. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia and P. nigrescens. The 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. In contrast, Augmentin appeared to be effective in decreasing the % sites colonized by A. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by C. ochracea. Knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for periodontal therapy.
TI  - Microbial alterations in supragingival dental plaque in response to a triclosan-containing dentifrice.
AB  - A total of 325 subjects were entered into a double-blind, stratified 2-treatment  clinical study that examined the effects of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan, 2% Gantrez copolymer and 0.243% sodium fluoride on supragingival dental plaque and gingivitis. A subset of 159 subjects including 72 men and 87 women participated in the microbiological component of this study, which was designed to detect shifts in supragingival bacterial species in response to triclosan. Subjects were divided into two groups: one performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and a control group used a placebo dentifrice without triclosan. At baseline, 3 and 6 months during treatment and at 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post-treatment, supragingival dental plaque was collected from the buccal and lingual surfaces of the 4 first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) select bacterial groups and bacterial species by culture; and 3) target periodontal pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia by immunofluorescence microscopy. There were few statistically significant differences between treatment groups in any of the 90 microbiological parameters measured at the 7 different time points. The control group demonstrated significantly higher levels of cultivable Neisseria and higher proportions at the 3-month treatment period of P. gingivalis-infected subjects and mean cells. After 6 months of treatment, the triclosan group demonstrated higher levels of fusiforms. Analysis of triclosan resistance data failed to detect a shift towards increased proportions of bacteria resistant to triclosan, and both treatment groups demonstrated triclosan-resistant strains, predominantly Veillonella dispar. This study confirms the microbiological safety of triclosan-containing dentifrices and suggests that continued use can be associated with beneficial alterations in the bacterial composition of supragingival dental plaque.
TI  - Effects of surgical treatment on the microbial flora in residual periodontal pockets.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modified Widman flap surgery on the microbial flora in deep residual periodontal pockets remaining after non-surgical treatment. Micro-organisms from samples of subgingival plaque obtained from adult periodontitis sites in six patients were cultured aerobically and anaerobically, on a variety of media and identified. Non-surgical treatment produced little clinical improvement and had little effect on the total microbial count. Subsequent modified Widman flap surgery resulted in significant clinical improvements which were accompanied by an overall reduction in microbial counts. Regular reviews for scaling and oral hygiene maintained the clinical improvements and balance in favour of beneficial microbial species during the 1 year of the study.
TI  - Delmopinol interactions with cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria.
AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. A second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. Fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mM (0.1%) or 6.4 mM (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. For electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. Treatment with 6.4 mM delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. The result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. More material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. Significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. It appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.
TI  - Periodontopathogens in elderly Chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  - If an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. To test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural Chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group, each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. Assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. Subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia group, Prevotella melaninogenica group, Capnocytophaga, Selenomonas, Campylobacter rectus as well as predominant Streptococcus and Actinomyces species. During the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. The latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "Best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and Actinomyces recovery. Similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. It is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.
TI  - Bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  - Periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (JP), rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP), and adult periodontitis (AP), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. These disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. The present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of PBMC of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. The AP group had a significantly lower production of IL-1ra when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g.) and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) (P < 0.05). Streptococcus sanguis (S.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF alpha production in all groups. The RPP group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (MC) than the AP group (P < 0.05). Additionally, JP patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (P < 0.05). In conclusion, IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or IL-6 production by peripheral blood MC after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. The results support the hypothesis that the cytokine IL-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: RPP and AP. Furthermore, elevated MC concentration in the RPP group compared to the AP group may be an important pathogenic feature in RPP.
TI  - Characteristics of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans invasion of and adhesion  to cultured epithelial cells.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) is highly implicated in periodontitis. We have developed several in vitro models using the KB oral cell line to examine A.a.-epithelial cell interactions. In support of the use of KB cell line model systems is our finding that A.a. invaded KB and primary gingival cells to the same extent. Invasion is an active event which requires new protein synthesis by both KB and A.a. Like many other intracellular parasites, A.a. invade by receptor-mediated endocytosis. We observed that internalized A.a. were surrounded by foci of actin which had been transported from the periphery of the KB cell. Adhesion of A.a. to KB cells occurred rapidly and stimulated the formation of microvilli. Adhesion is affected by both host factors (saliva, serum, [NaCl]) and culture conditions. Multiple determinants [fimbriae, outer membrane proteins, vesicles, and/or an extracellular amorphous material (ExAmMat)] which are either associated with the A.a. surface or are released into the milieu are involved. We determined that ExAmMat can convey adhesiveness to weakly adherent A.a. and to at least one other oral species (Streptococcus parasanguis).
TI  - Adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  - Numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. We compared the ability of Streptococcus and Actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsHA) and human saliva (sHA). We also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. We show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. Dissolved rsHA beads revealed a major protein band (35-49 kD), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kD and alpha-amylase (66 kD) were also identified. Overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsHA are similar to those observed with sHA.
TI  - Predominant microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to study the microflora of severe, moderate and minimal periodontal lesions, in young adults with rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP). Subgingival plaque samples were taken from 142 periodontal lesions in 10 young adults aging 25 to 35 years. The examination of the subgingival microflora indicated that certain species, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Campylobacter species were found to be predominant in severe periodontal lesions. B. forsythus, P. gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, F. nucleatum, Capnocytophaga ochracea, were predominant in medium lesions while Streptococcus species and Actinomyces species, C. ochracea, Haemophilus segnis and Veillonella parvula, were found in higher levels in minimal periodontal lesions.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  - Cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by Cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. Interaction studies were made by adding each of the different UV-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. The reference oral bacterial strains were: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria Staphylococcus aureus 209 and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The target cells were: gingival fibroblasts (GF), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (PMF), pulpal fibroblasts (PF), HeLa-cells (HeLa), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (LN). Synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. The cytotoxicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of P. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of S. aureus it was increased. Bacterial interactions with F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. The cytotoxicity of F. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with A. actinomycetemcomitans. Each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.
TI  - Effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  - Previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. The effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase K on cell lysis was determined following incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. Overall, gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. The most susceptible bacteria were Actinomyces spp., Eubacterium saburreum, Prevotella intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loescheii, Treponema denticola and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of Actinomyces spp., E. saburreum, C. ochracea, P. intermedia, P. loescheii, Porphyromonas gingivalis and T. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase K. Interestingly, the growth of F. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. The observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their growth. It is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils and essential oil components towards oral bacteria.
AB  - A method for reproducibly determining minimal inhibitory concentrations and minimal bactericidal concentrations of plant extracts towards fastidiously and facultatively anaerobic oral bacteria, predicated upon measurements of optical densities in microtitre plate wells, was devised. The antimicrobial properties of some botanical oils were surveyed; of these, Australian tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and sage oil proved to be the most potent essential oils, whereas thymol and eugenol were potent essential oil components.
TI  - Isolation frequency and serotype distribution of mutans streptococci and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and clinical periodontal status in Finnish and Vietnamese children.
AB  - The isolation frequency and serotype distribution of mutans streptococci and A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) were investigated in a group of Finnish (n = 16) and Vietnamese (n = 16) children, matched by sex, age, and caries status. In the Vietnamese children, the isolation frequencies were higher than in the Finnish children: 100%/62% for mutans streptococci and 78%/13% for A.a. Isolates (n = 3-8) from plaque and saliva were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique using serotype-specific antisera against serotypes c, e, f, d, and g for mutans streptococci and a, b, c, d, and e for A.a. The distribution of mutans streptococci serotypes in Finnish/Vietnamese children was: c 100%/50%; e 10%/31%; d 0%/56%; g 20%/38%. The frequency of plural serotypes was 30%/75%, respectively. In the Vietnamese group the serotype distribution of A.a. was: a 36%, b 27%, and c 63%; 45% of children carried two serotypes. One Finnish child harbored serotype a and one serotype b. The mean percentage of bleeding gingival sites was 7.4 in the Finnish and 15.1 in the Vietnamese group. Calculus and clinically deepened gingival pockets were more frequent findings in the Vietnamese children. The results indicate considerable differences in bacteriologic status and in clinical periodontal status between these Finnish and Vietnamese children.
TI  - Adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  - Microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (GTR) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. The purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different GTR membranes. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the test membranes. In part I of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. Six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus mutans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part II of this study. The membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37 degrees C. Membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls. At 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (RTF) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. Each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml RTF to detach adherent bacteria. The detached adherent bacteria were counted using a Petroff-Hausser chamber. Data were analyzed by using the SAS program. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. Results showed S. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. Selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. Polyglactin 910 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower S. mutants adherence than either the ePTFE or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effective method for discriminating between oral bacterial and human alkaline phosphatase activity.
AB  - Alkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activity was quantitatively compared in various kinds of oral bacteria. High ALPase activity was detected in 3 species of periodontal bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga sputigena. The ALPase activity detected in these bacteria was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). By contrast, the activity of mammalian ALPase isoenzymes was not inhibited at all even in the presence of 1% SDS. These results indicate that the ALPase assay in combination with 1% SDS can identify the origin of ALPase detected in gingival crevicular fluid as being from bacteria or from a host response. Clinical examination with adult periodontitis revealed that ALPase activity in gingival crevicular fluid from the patients consisted of a combination of SDS-sensitive and SDS-resistant activities. These findings indicate that ALPase activity detected in gingival crevicular fluid originates not only from bacteria but also from a host response.
TI  - A comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  - This study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in VMGA or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. Sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. The samples transported in VMGA III showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. This was explained by the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of VMGA III, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. In a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.
TI  - The binding of delmopinol and chlorhexidine to Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strains with varying degrees of surface hydrophobicity.
AB  - This study evaluated the binding of chlorhexidine and the new surface-active anti-plaque agent delmopinol hydrochloride to Streptococcus mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells with various cell surface hydrophobicities. The influence of saliva concentration on the binding of these compounds was also investigated. The radiolabeled compounds were incubated with bacteria and the cells were recovered using a centrifugal filtering technique. Delmopinol had higher binding to the hydrophilic variant strains than to the hydrophobic parent strains; chlorhexidine had higher binding to hydrophobic than to hydrophilic A. actinomycetemcomitans strains and higher binding to hydrophilic than to hydrophobic S. mutans strains. The presence of salivary films decreased the binding of both compounds. Both delmopinol and chlorhexidine had stronger affinity to A. actinomycetemcomitans cells than to S. mutans cells. At equimolar concentrations, delmopinol had a lower binding to all strains tested than chlorhexidine. The high reversibility of the delmopinol binding might be related to a higher diffusion rate and solubility compared with that of chlorhexidine. The amphiphilicity of both molecules is an important feature in their retention to S. mutans and A. actinomycetemcomitans strains of varying hydrophobicities and could play an important role in the substantivity of delmopinol or chlorhexidine in the oral cavity.
TI  - Transmission of oral bacterial species between spouses.
AB  - The transmission of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and mutans streptococci was studied between 4 married couples who suffered from advanced periodontitis. Of the 20 couples investigated, the 4 in which both spouses harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis were chosen for the transmission study. Three of these couples also harbored mutans streptococci. A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (8-24 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (5-23 per subject) were serotyped by immunodiffusion technique. For ribotyping, chromosomal DNA from A. actinomycetemcomitans isolates (4-5 per subject) and mutans streptococcal isolates (4-11 per subject) was digested with restriction endonucleases ClaI or BglI and HindIII or SmaI, respectively. P. gingivalis isolates (2-15 per subject) were ribotyped by using ClaI, BglI and SmaI. The blotted restriction fragments were hybridized to the plasmid pKK3535, which contains the rRNA operon of the E. coli chromosome. The spouses in 2 couples shared the same sero- and ribotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. mutans. P. gingivalis ribotypes were identical in 2 couples. The result suggests transmission of oral bacteria between spouses.
TI  - Bacteriology of dental infections.
AB  - The most common dental diseases, periodontal disease and dental caries, are chronic infections caused by bacteria of normal oral flora. When these bacteria increase in number and irritation exceeds the host defence threshold, disease arises. The human oral flora comprises more than 300 different bacteria. During the last decade approximately 10 species, mainly Gram-negative anaerobes, have been noted as putative pathogens in periodontal disease. The Gram-positive and facultatively anaerobic mutans streptococci are aetiologically the most important bacteria in dental caries. Data have rapidly increased on the association of these bacteria with certain periodontal diseases or caries, on phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, antibiotic susceptibility patterns and transmission among family members. Chronic dental infections have been the focus of renewed interest because of recent advances in oral microbiology as well as in medicine. We now know that in addition to oral streptococci, recently classified, fastidious periodontal anaerobes can be detected from various extra-oral infections. Oral bacteria may spread into the blood stream through ulcerated epithelium in diseased periodontal pockets and cause transient bacteraemias, which are regarded as increased risk, especially for immunocompromised patients or persons with endoprotheses. In these patients, routine antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for invasive dental care procedures. Also the new association between dental infections and myocardial/cerebral infarction have offered new challenges for cooperation between dental and medical researchers.
TI  - Antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  - This study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, Listerine Antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Twenty-four hour cultures of C. albicans, A. viscosus, S. sanguis, F. nucleatum, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in buffer. Triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-L-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either Listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Peldri II. Exposure of the microorganisms to Listerine Antiseptic for 30 seconds resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. The extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in S. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. These results suggest that a brief exposure to Listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of Prevention mouthrinse.
AB  - Prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. To determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. A spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Serratia marcescens and Candida albicans. Microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. Inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. MIC determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to Prevention mouthrinse, with MICs ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold dilutions. Bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. Brief (5-minute) exposure of S. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. Under the constraints of this type of study, Prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. We support the notion that Prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. A 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of Prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.
TI  - Levels of salivary IgA antibodies reactive with bacteria from dental plaque are associated with susceptibility to experimental gingivitis.
AB  - Serum IgG, IgA and IgM and salivary IgA antibody levels reactive with extracts from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Eubacterium saburreum and Streptococcus mutans, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 12 persons before, during and after experimental gingivitis. The participants refrained from cleaning their teeth until 50% of their gingival units showed bleeding after gentle probing, but not longer than 15 days. Samples were taken from serum and saliva, before and during the period of experimental gingivitis, and up to 8 weeks after the start of the experiment. A pattern with minor fluctuations in specific serum and salivary antibody activities was consistently found in all patients. This indicates that immunoregulatory mechanisms succeed in maintaining unchanged antibody levels when plaque load increases. A subgroup of participants with low mean numbers of bleeding gingival units after plaque accumulation, showed significantly higher salivary IgA antibody levels reactive with S. mutans, A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. saburreum, as compared with the subgroup reaching high bleeding after probing scores (p < 0.05). When 1 person with outlying values (p < 0.05) for P. gingivalis was excluded from the tests, the former group also showed statistically significant higher salivary antibody levels to this bacterial species. High levels of salivary IgA directed against bacteria in dental plaque might thus protect against the development of gingivitis.
TI  - Characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  - Three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. Twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (Actinomyces, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Prevotella, and Actinobacillus). Nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four Prevotella denticola strains, two Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of P. melaninogenica, Streptococcus constellatus, and A. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. Incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. With one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the S. constellatus isolate. Genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in Escherichia coli using pBR322. Hemolytic clones were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). Extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three P. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. Two of the P. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 Kb inserts. The clone derived from the third strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 Kb region, but the flanking DNA showed no homology even though all three P. denticola isolates were shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Lethal photosensitization of bacteria in subgingival plaque from patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mW Helium/Neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of 50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue O as a photosensitizer. Viable counts of various groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. The median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (Porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (Fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x 10(4) cfu (streptococci). The dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. Overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. However, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. Low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.
TI  - Agglutination of Streptococcus mutans serotype C cells but inhibition of Porphyromonas gingivalis autoaggregation by human lactoferrin.
AB  - The ability of various forms of human lactoferrin (LF) to agglutinate oral Streptococcus mutans, Strep. sobrinus, Strep. rattus, Strep. sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells was studied spectrophotometrically. Fe3+ saturated LF was unable to agglutinate these bacteria, whereas iron-free LF (apo LF) effectively agglutinated Strep. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. The efficiency and rate of agglutination of Strep. mutans were somewhat lower with apo LF than with human whole saliva. However, secretory IgA, phosphate and whole saliva almost totally abolished the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans, suggesting binding to the same target sites on bacterial cell surfaces, or to each other. The presence of exogenous iron (Fe2+, Fe3+), lactoperoxidase or serum albumin did not affect the agglutination by apo LF. Low Ca2+ (50-100 microns) slightly enhanced the agglutination by apo LF but higher concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM) totally blocked the apo LF-mediated agglutination of Strep. mutans. Both saliva and apo LF significantly delayed the rapid autoaggregation of P. gingivalis cells. Aggregation of P. gingivalis is considered a potential virulence factor and a protective mechanism against the host's cellular defences in the gingival crevice. These findings show a novel, strain-specific antibacterial mechanism for LF against Strep. mutans and P. gingivalis and adds a new compound to the group of agglutinating proteins in human saliva.
TI  - The distribution and interrelationship of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and BANA scores among older adults.
AB  - In a random sample of subgingival dental plaque samples from 375 blacks and 300 whites aged 65 and older, immunofluorescence assays for 3 target pathogens including Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia, and BANA enzyme analysis were carried out. Blacks had significantly greater proportions of P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in their subgingival plaque and had significantly higher BANA scores. These assay results were investigated for concordance with each other and with 2 cariogenic salivary bacteria, Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli. In general for both races, the periodontal pathogens were more likely to occur in combination with each other than with either S. mutans or lactobacilli. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were more frequently associated with each other than with A. actinomycetemcomitans. There was a significant negative concordance between BANA and A. actinomycetemcomitans in whites and a significant positive concordance between BANA and P. intermedia in blacks.

TI  - Sub-gingival microflora in Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  - The Macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. This report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in M. mulatta monkeys. Three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. Plaque samples were obtained from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. Several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. Anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. The major microbial groups were Haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (TAC): 21-51), Peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), Actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), Fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (BPAR) (80%, 0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). Microbial groups detected less often were Wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), Capnocytophaga sp. (30%), Eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), Campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). Seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. The gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the Actinomyces sp., P. micros and BPAR; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to pre-scaling levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Periodontal disease and dental caries in relation to primary IgG subclass and other humoral immunodeficiencies.
AB  - 22 females and 3 males with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia (n = 6) or IgG subclass deficiencies with (n = 3) or without (n = 16) concomitant IgA deficiency were examined for periodontal disease and dental caries. Only 1 patient showed more tooth loss than that found in the normal Swedish population. 1 patient demonstrated advanced periodontal disease. No patient exhibited more severe dental caries than that of comparable normal Swedes. Microbiological samples from periodontal pockets and saliva showed recovery of potential periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria within normal ranges. This study could not support the notion that immunodeficient subjects exhibit an increased risk of developing periodontal disease or dental caries.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of povidone-iodine solution to oral pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
AB  - Seven species of periodontal pathogenic bacteria (Bacteroides, gingivalis, Bacteroides intermedius, Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp., Eikenella corrodens) and two control species (Streptococcus intermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were selected in order to study the bactericidal effects of 10% povidone-iodine (PVP-I) aqueous solution in vitro. The PVP-I solution was diluted to 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and 12800 x and contact times were 15, 30 and 60 seconds. The strongest bactericidal effects on the seven periodontal pathogenic bacteria and two control bacteria were seen at a dilution of 400 x and a contact time of 15 seconds. Based on these findings, we advocate a 0.25% solution of 10% aqueous PVP-I for oral mucosa and periodontal pocket irrigation.
TI  - Sensitization of oral bacteria in biofilms to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  - Biofilms of Streptococcus sanguis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared on the surfaces of agar plates and a number of compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize bacteria in these biofilms to killing by light from a 7.3 mW Helium/Neon (He/Ne) laser. Toluidine blue O and methylene blue enabled detectable killing of all four target organisms after exposure to He/Ne light for 30 s. Aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine, haematoporphyrin HCl and haematoporphyrin ester were effective photosensitizers of only some of the target organisms. These findings suggest that lethal photosensitization may be an effective means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from dental plaque.
TI  - Effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  - The purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (SnF2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of SnF2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). The antibacterial inhibitory effect of various SnF2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of S. mutans, S. sanguis, S. sobrinus, A. viscosus, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and B. intermedius. When twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent SnF2 were compared for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the SnF2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). With increasing concentration of SnF2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). SnF2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. This in vitro study demonstrated that certain SnF2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the SnF2.
TI  - Comparative clinical and microbiological effects of topical subgingival application of metronidazole 25% dental gel and scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis.
AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the clinical and microbiological effects of topical application of a metronidazole gel and a single session of subgingival scaling in the treatment of adult periodontitis. An open, randomized controlled clinical study design was employed. Each of 24 subjects received the 2 treatments simultaneously each in 2 randomly selected quadrants of the dentition. The metronidazole, 25% gel was applied subgingivally on days 0 and 7. Scaling was carried out in one quadrant on day 0 and in one quadrant on day 7. Clinical and microbiological examinations were carried out before treatment and on days 21, 49, 91, 133, and 175 of the experimental period. The microbiological analyses included determination of total anaerobically cultivable bacteria, and relative proportions of anaerobes, aerobes, black-pigmented anaerobic Gram negative rods, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococci, and spirochetes. Both treatments were effective in reducing probing pocket depth and bleeding on probing. Metronidazole tended to be a little better than scaling during the study period and the clinical effects of both treatments persisted during the whole 6 months observation period. Local metronidazole treatment induced a significant and long-lasting shift in the subgingival flora towards a composition more compatible with health and comparable to that obtained by mechanical debridement. Proportions of black pigmented anaerobes including Prevotella intermedia, and the number of spirochetes were significantly reduced after both treatments with a concomitant increase in the proportions of streptococci. While scaling resulted in a statistically significant increase in the proportion of A. actinomycetemcomitans, this was avoided after metronidazole treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. Periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. Only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. The antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to Actinobacillus sp., P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia in that order. In general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. However, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. In addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. These findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. Differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. These included high levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 in LJP and RPP subjects and to A. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in LJP and GJP subjects.
TI  - Sensitization of oral bacteria to killing by low-power laser radiation.
AB  - Twenty-seven compounds were screened for their ability to sensitize Streptococcus sanguis to killing by light from a 7.3-mW Helium/Neon (HeNe) laser. Bacteria were mixed with various concentrations of the test compounds, spread over the surfaces of agar plates, and then exposed to light from the HeNe laser for various time periods. The plates were then incubated and examined for zones of inhibition. Those compounds found to be effective photosensitizers were then tested against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Toluidine blue O, azure B chloride, and methylene blue at concentrations of 0.005% (wt/vol) were effective photosensitizers of all four species, enabling killing of bacteria following exposure to laser light for only 30 s.
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Humoral IgG antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  - Mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. Their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. The etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral IgG antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years, who were at risk for root-surface caries. Antibody activity to Streptococcus mutans strain Ingbritt, S. mutans/S. sobrinus GTFs, S. faecalis strain 19433, Actinomyces viscosus strain WVU 626, Actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, Lactobacillus casei, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain Y4, Porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, Eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and Wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by ELISA. Pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. IgG antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject DMF scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between DMF scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. Further relationships between levels of S. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. Numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Modulation of human neutrophil adherence by oral bacteria.
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) comprise over 90 per cent of leukocytes in the oral cavity. Although these phagocytic cells have primary defence roles in the gingiva, their stimulation by micro-organisms may also cause substantial tissue damage due to the release of lysosomal enzymes and oxygen radicals. Adherence of PMNs to the endothelium and their subsequent diapedesis and egress to areas of infection are considered early vital events in the inflammatory process. In this study, oral bacteria were screened to determine their direct effects on PMN activation using an in vitro method of measuring PMN adherence to Dacron fibres. Most of the bacteria investigated increased PMN adherence, indicating their potential to cause tissue damage through the release of PMN lysosomal enzymes and other products. In contrast, Bacteroides species suppressed PMNs, indicating their ability to circumvent the phagocytic cells, thus gaining a potential advantage in dental colonization. The modulatory effects of oral bacteria on PMN activation may have significant roles in the immunopathogenesis of oral disease.
TI  - Microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  - A group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. These organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. One periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each IDDM patient. Increased levels of the periodontal pathogens Prevotella intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., Bacteroides gracilis, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Campylobacter rectus (formerly Wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. Increased prevalence of the organisms P. intermedia, P. melaninogenica spp., and C. rectus were found at the diseased sites. A significantly higher percentage of P. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.
TI  - Enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  - This study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and DNA probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. Fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on Trypticase soy agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. Colonies of reference strains were lifted onto Nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial DNA to the filters. Positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. Cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of Streptococcus mitis reacted with the probe to Streptococcus sanguis II. Subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of 26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. Samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees C. Colonies were lifted as described above. Filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled DNA probes. The probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. The colony lift method and DNA probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. In addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.
TI  - The use of DNA probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  - The present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. Subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. The mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). The probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. The % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; V. parvula, 98; B. intermedius I, 98; S. sanguis II, 96; B. intermedius II, 95; C. ochracea, 94; B. gingivalis, 91; S. sanguis I, 85; W. recta, 83; F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; S. intermedius, 80; B. forsythus, 76; P. micros, 74; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. The % of sites colonized by each of the 14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. The median number of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for V. parvula. In half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than 4%. When subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  - The effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish Cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (ADT-test in vitro). As positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. The test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one Candida strain. The positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. No antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. Toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against S. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. The results from this study support earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. The possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.
TI  - Relation of counts of microbial species to clinical status at the sampled site.
AB  - The purpose of the present investigation was to relate clinical characteristics at a site to the frequency of detection, absolute counts and proportions of 14 subgingival species. Subgingival plaque samples were removed by curette from the mesial surface of 2299 teeth in 3 healthy and 87 subjects with periodontal attachment loss. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the DNA fixed to the filters. Digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes were used to identify colonies of each test species. Measurements of pocket depth, attachment level, recession, redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration were made at each sampled site. Total viable counts at sites ranged from 10(3) to greater than 10(8) and were strongly related to pocket depth. Mean total counts at sites less than 3 mm averaged 4.6 x 10(6), while mean counts at sites greater than 7 mm averaged 2.0 x 10(7). Species enumerated and % of sites colonized were as follows; V. parvula 44; S. sanguis II 36; B. intermedius I 33; C. ochracea 31; B. intermedius II 30; S. sanguis I 29; B. gingivalis 27; S. intermedius 25; P. micros 24; W. recta 23; F. nucleatum ss vincentii 18; B. forsythus 15; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 10; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 8. Counts of B. intermedius II were higher at sites which exhibited gingival redness while B. intermedius I was higher at sites which bled on probing. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b was more frequent and at higher mean % at sites without recession. The opposite was true for S. sanguis II. B. gingivalis was somewhat more prevalent and at higher levels at suppurating sites. B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II and B. forsythus were found more frequently and at higher levels at sites with deeper pockets, while V. parvula was less prevalent at sites with pocket depths less than 4 mm. B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b increased with increasing pocket depth in both localized and widespread disease subjects, but mean counts were higher in the localized disease subjects at any pocket depth. Only W. recta was found at higher levels at deep sites in widespread disease subjects when compared with similar sites in localized disease subjects. No suspected pathogens were detected in 38% of shallow sites, 31% of intermediate sites and 22% of deep sites, 2/3 of deep pockets, but less than 1/2 of shallow pockets harbored at least 2 of the suspected pathogens.
TI  - Relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  - The relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. A subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using Gracey curettes. Samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. After 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the DNA fixed to the filters. Digoxygenin-labeled DNA probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17 of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. The % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. The species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the active and inactive subjects were as follows; B gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; W. recta 1.3, 0.6; B. intermedius I 2.5, 2.0; B. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; F. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; S. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; P. micros 1.5, 1.5; B. intermedius II 1.6, 1.7; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; S. sanguis I 1.8, 2.1; S. sanguis II 2.7, 3.0; V. parvula 3.9, 4.2; C. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of surgical and non-surgical periodontal treatment on periodontal status and subgingival microbiota.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate, on a short-term basis, the clinical and microbiological effects of a single course of scaling and root planing as compared with those obtained by flap surgery in patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis. 11 patients participated in the study. Using a split-mouth design, one quadrant of the mouth was treated with reverse bevel flap surgery, whereas the contralateral one was subjected to a single course of scaling and root planing. 2 approximal sites on single-rooted teeth with a pocket depth greater than or equal to 5 mm were monitored clinically and microbiologically for 16 weeks after active treatment. Both techniques resulted in a gain of probable attachment levels, a reduction in bleeding on probing and a reduced mean pocket depth, although 31.2% of the sites in the scaling and root planing group still had 6-7 mm deep pockets at 8 and 16 weeks after treatment. Both techniques reduced median relative proportions and frequencies of detection of black-pigmented Bacteroides species. A highly statistically significant increase (p less than 0.01) in median proportions of oral streptococci was recorded only for surgery within the 1st month post-operatively. No correlation was found between residual pocket depth and any of the microbiological parameters considered in the study, suggesting that residual pocket depth does not exert a significant influence on bacterial subgingival recolonization after therapy. The results from this study suggest that surgery can be as effective as scaling and root planing in favoring the establishment of micro-organisms compatible with periodontal health, although this effect is limited to the 1st month after therapy.
TI  - Are certain oral pathogens part of normal oral flora in denture-wearing edentulous subjects?
AB  - A complete loss of teeth may eliminate some pathogenic bacteria for lack of a suitable habitat for colonization. The occurrence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, black-pigmented Bacteroides, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and yeasts was investigated in 51 edentulous subjects with complete denture(s); mean age 74 years (range 44-92 years). None of the subjects had received antibiotics during the preceding 6 months. Four swab samples per subject were taken from the fitting surface of the upper denture, from the palate, buccal mucosae and dorsum of the tongue. At least 0.5 ml of stimulated saliva was collected into a sterile tube. The samples were cultivated aerobically and anaerobically using nonselective and selective media. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not found in any of the samples. Black-pigmented Bacteroides were found in 49 (96%) and yeasts in 25 (49%) of the subjects. Of the 49 saliva samples, 41 (84%) yielded mutans streptococci and 45 (92%) lactobacilli. In contrast to black-pigmented Bacteroides, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli, A. actinomycetemcomitans may not belong to the normal oral flora of edentulous subjects wearing dentures.
