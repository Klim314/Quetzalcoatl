TI  - Oral Microbiota Shift after 12-Week Supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289; A Randomized Control Trial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rDNA hypervariable region V3-V4 after 12 weeks of daily Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 and PTA 5289 consumption. Forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 CFU of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). Presence of L. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific PCR. Tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. A total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. After removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the Human Oral Microbiome Database. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Streptococcus was the most common genus and the S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group comprised the dominant species. The number of observed species was unaffected by L. reuteri exposure. However, subjects who had consumed L. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and PCR detected L. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. L. reuteri intake correlated with increased S. oralis/S. mitis/S. mitis bv2/S. infantis group and Campylobacter concisus, Granulicatella adiacens, Bergeyella sp. HOT322, Neisseria subflava, and SR1 [G-1] sp. HOT874 detection and reduced S. mutans, S. anginosus, N. mucosa, Fusobacterium periodicum, F. nucleatum ss vincentii, and Prevotella maculosa detection. This effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. CONCLUSIONS: L. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. The biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02311218.
TI  - Shifts in Campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral Campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. While the etiological significance of Campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of C. gracilis, C. concisus, and C. curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. OBJECTIVES: This study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the Campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. DESIGN: Subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a newly developed nested PCR approach, in which all Campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. The resulting mixture of 16S-rRNA-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. In all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on DNA hybridization on a microarray. RESULTS: The highly prevalent Campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of C. rectus, C. gracilis, C. concisus, and C. curvus. Cluster analysis based on SSCP-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in the Campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. The focus on members of the Campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with mixed dentition.
AB  - A diversity of microbial species has been detected in children's oral flora at an early age. To investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of different groups of teeth in children with mixed dentition, 40 systemically healthy children, aged 7-8 years, randomly chosen, were examined. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of 21, 41, 16 and 36 permanent teeth and 53, 73, 64 and 84 deciduous teeth. The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and nonselective media. Forty-five different microbial species were isolated from both permanent and deciduous teeth. Streptococcus sanguis (79-70%), Streptococcus mitis (66-65%), Prevotella melaninogenica (51-57%), Eikenella corrodens (51-52%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (46-34%), Capnocytophaga ochracea (45-45%), Actinomyces naeslundii (39-60%) and Prevotella intermedia (42-35%) were among the most frequently detected species in permanent and deciduous teeth respectively. Several suspected periodontal pathogens, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella loescheii, Campylobacter gracilis, Bacteroides forsythus, Campylobacter concisus, Peptostreptococcus micros and Selenomonas sputigena, albeit less frequently detected, were present in the microbiota of these children. The bacterial species Streptococcus constellatus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, E. corrodens and Fusobacterium nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding permanent and deciduous teeth whereas Streptococcus intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were associated with bleeding.
TI  - Profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  - Eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. The aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). The samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. Forty-one different microbial species were isolated. Gemella morbillorum and Peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while P. micros, Streptococcus intermedius, Bacteroides forsythus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella loeschei, P. melaninogenica and Selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. The bacterial species S. constellatus, G. morbillorum and P. magnus were isolated in greater numbers in incisors and P. micros, S. intermedius, Campylobacter concisus, Bacteroides egertheii, B. forsythus, P. oralis and S. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. Cluster I was predominated by S. constellatus, S. mitis, S. sanguis, G. morbillorum, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; cluster II was predominated by S. sanguis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, C. ochracea and P. intermedia; cluster III was predominated by S. mitis, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum, P. loeschei, P. melaninogenica and P. oralis; and finally cluster IV was predominated by S. sanguis, C. gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Campylobacter gracilis, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia. The bacterial species S. constellatus, P. micros, Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, Eikenella corrodens and F. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while S. intermedius, C. concisus, P. intermedia and P. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.
TI  - Subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (GO). Age was inversely associated with the GO. Plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with GO, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of GO. The gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the GO. Statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of GO were detected for Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium mortiferum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium and Selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. Significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species Eubacterium alactolyticum, Campylobacter concisus, C. gingivalis, C. ochracea, C. sputigena, F. mortiferum, F. nucleatum, and F. varium from the more enlarged lesions (GO >3).
TI  - Microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  - It has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. The purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. The presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic DNA probes and checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. Clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. Similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. Community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. One complex consisted of the tightly related group: Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Treponema denticola. The 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the Fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Peptostreptococcus micros. Species associated with this group included: Eubacterium nodatum, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter showae, Streptococcus constellatus and Campylobacter gracilis. The 3rd complex consisted of Streptococcus sanguis, S. oralis, S. mitis, S. gordonii and S. intermedius. The 4th complex was comprised of 3 Capnocytophaga species, Campylobacter concisus, Eikenella corrodens and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. The 5th complex consisted of Veillonella parvula and Actinomyces odontolyticus. A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, Selenomonas noxia and Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (A. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. The 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
TI  - Microbiota of rapidly progressive periodontitis lesions in association with clinical parameters.
AB  - The microbial population in 73 rapidly progressive periodontitis (RPP) lesions in 10 young adults aged 25 to 35 years (5 males, 5 females) was studied in relation to the clinical parameters probing depth, bleeding on probing, and suppuration, which were recorded at the sampled sites. Porphyromonas gingivalis was found to predominate (26.7%) in 73 periodontal lesions with clinical probing depth > 6 mm, followed by Bacteroides forsythus (23.6%), and Prevotella intermedia (15.7%). The prevalence of P. gingivalis was 91.7%, Fusobacterium nucleatum, 90.4%; Streptococcus intermedius, 87.7%; and B. forsythus, 53.4%. Significant differences between bleeding index 0, 1, and 2 (P < 0.05) in frequency of detection were found for P. intermedia, Campylobacter concisus, Selenomonas sputigena, and Peptostreptococcus micros at bleeding sites and for Streptococcus sanguis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and B. forsythus (P < 0.001) at non-bleeding sites. Between suppurating and non-suppurating sites, significant differences (P < 0.05) in frequency of isolation were found for P. intermedia, Capnocytophaga ochracea, and A. actinomycetemcomitans at suppurating sites and for F. nucleatum at non-suppurating sites.
TI  - Longitudinal monitoring of humoral antibody in subjects with destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. Periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. Only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. The antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to Actinobacillus sp., P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, C. concisus, F. nucleatum and P. intermedia in that order. In general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. However, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. In addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. These findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. Differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. These included high levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 in LJP and RPP subjects and to A. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in LJP and GJP subjects.
TI  - Susceptibility and resistance of plaque bacteria to minocycline.
AB  - The in vitro susceptibility of 55 strains of subgingival plaque bacteria to minocycline was determined. A concentration of 1 microgram/ml minocycline was found to inhibit 85% of the strains tested and the MIC ranged from 0.03 to 32 micrograms/ml. For 71% of the strains tested the MBC was at least 4 times greater than the corresponding MIC, suggesting a bacteriostatic activity for minocycline. A concentration of 20 mg/ml of magnesium ions was capable of neutralizing 8 micrograms/ml of minocycline and was used to eliminate "carry-over" effects inherent in the experimental procedure. After 6 to 7 weeks exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of minocycline there was no appreciable increase in the MICs of most organisms with the exception of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans NCTC 10981 and Campylobacter concisus NCTC 11485. Short term (6 hour exposure of bacteria to minocycline (8 micrograms/ml) markedly reduced the viability of a number of periodontopathogens but had little effect on the viability of Veillonella parvula NCTC 11456 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 11326. These in vitro investigations have demonstrated that minocycline is capable of inhibiting most of the periodontitis-associated bacteria tested and can kill some of these bacteria after a comparatively short exposure time. However, some of the organisms tested exhibited a low susceptibility to minocycline and others became less susceptible following exposure to low concentrations of the antibiotic for several weeks.
TI  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological features associated with the treatment of active periodontosis lesions.
AB  - Clinical, microbiological and immunological factors were examined using data from a subject with periodontosis. The subject was monitored at bimonthly intervals for 26 months at 6 sites per tooth for redness, plaque, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth, and attachment level. Using attachment level measurements and the tolerance method of analysis, sites with active disease and control (inactive) sites of equal pocket depth were selected. Subgingival plaque samples were taken from these sites for predominant cultivable and dark field evaluation before, and 5 and 13 months after treatment by Widman flap surgery and systemic tetracycline. 50 isolates from each of 5 sites monitored before and after treatment were characterized and, if possible, identified. Active sites showed between 2 and 6 mm of attachment loss prior to therapy and "gained" between 2 and 9 mm of attachment after therapy. The control sites "gained" 0 to 1 mm of attachment after therapy. Bleeding on probing was significantly reduced after treatment, whereas plaque accumulation increased significantly in the sampled sites. Similar changes were seen in the remaining sites. The proportions of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Selenomonas sputigena were elevated in active sites, while proportions of Bacteroides intermedius were elevated in control sites. 5 months after treatment, proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans, S. sputigena and Eikenella corrodens were significantly decreased in the previously active sites and proportions of B. intermedius and E. corrodens were significantly decreased in the control sites. 13 months after therapy, the proportions of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Capnocytophaga species had increased. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine models which could "predict" the outcome, attachment level change in the previous monitoring period. The proportions of A. actinomycetemcomitans and S. sputigena, which were associated with destruction, coupled with the proportions of Streptococcus sanguis II and Campylobacter concisus which were associated with "gain" could predict prior attachment level change with an r2 of 0.93. Humoral antibody response to A. actinomycetemcomitans and C. sputigena significantly increased in a period in which multiple actively breaking down sites were detected. Antibody responses to 20 other species tested did not significantly change during the course of monitoring. Crevicular fluid and tissue levels of antibody to A. actinomycetemcomitans were elevated in 5 of 6 active destructive lesions prior to therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
