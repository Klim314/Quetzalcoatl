TI  - Prevalence, species distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in Lithuanian pet animals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial genus Staphylococcus consists of many species that causes infections in pet animals. Antimicrobial resistant staphylococci cause infections that are difficult to treat and they are important from the point of one health perspective. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) species, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in diseased pet animals (Group A) and kennel dogs (Group B) in Lithuania and to characterize the isolates according to their antimicrobial resistance. RESULTS: Twenty-one MRS isolates were obtained from 395 clinical samples (5.3 %; CI 95 % 3.5-8.0) of Group A animals. Sixteen, four and one isolates were from dogs, cats and a pet rabbit, respectively. The mecA gene was present in 20 isolates, whereas one isolate was positive for the mecC gene. Twenty-one MRS isolates (20.0 %; CI 95 % 13.5-28.6) were obtained from the vagina of female dogs (n = 105) (Group B). All isolates carried the mecA gene. Twelve MRS species were isolated of which S. pseudintermedius was the most common (18/42) followed by S. haemolyticus (8/42) and S. lentus (4/42). MRSA was not found. All MRS strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Resistance to tetracycline (16/21), clindamycin (15/21) and erythromycin (14/21) was the most common types of resistance in Group A animals. Three isolates also demonstrated resistance to rifampin. Resistance toward gentamicin (16/21), ciprofloxacin (15/21), macrolides (15/21) and tetracycline (12/21) was the most common in kennel dogs (Group B). The most common genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials (excluding beta-lactams) in isolates from Group A pets were tetK (21/42), aph(3')-IIIa (11/42) and aac(6')-Ie-aph(2'')-Ia (9/42). CONCLUSIONS: A wide range of MRS species were found in pet animals in Lithuania. MRSA was not found.
TI  - The distribution of pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among canine surgical wound infections in Sweden in relation to different risk factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a common nosocomial infection in dogs and a growing concern in veterinary hospitals as an increase in multidrug-resistant pathogens is reported. Despite the need for rational and prudent antimicrobial use, few peer-reviewed and published veterinary studies have investigated the pathogenic growth including susceptibility patterns of the isolated pathogens in canine SSIs. The first objective of the present study was to estimate the distribution of bacterial pathogens in dogs with SSI and to investigate whether this was influenced by type of surgical procedure (clean, clean-contaminated, contaminated or dirty), duration of hospitalization, wound classification and depth of the infection, or antimicrobial treatment. The second objective was to assess susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials. During three years, four animal referral hospitals and three small animal clinics submitted bacterial swabs from canine SSIs for culture and susceptibility, together with a questionnaire completed by the attending clinician. RESULTS: Approximately two thirds of the in total 194 isolates were staphylococci. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most prevalent finding (46%) followed by beta haemolytic Streptococcus spp. (24%). No associations between distribution of the isolated pathogens and classification of the surgical procedure, duration of hospitalization or depth of the SSI were shown, with the exception of Escherichia coli isolates being significantly more often found in deep wound infections than in superficial skin infections. Overall the possibilities of finding first generations antimicrobials to treat the SSIs included in the study were favorable, as the isolated pathogens were mostly without acquired antimicrobial resistance and multidrug resistance was uncommon. There were only three cases of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius-infections (one percent of all isolates), one case of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing E. coli-infection, and no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. CONCLUSIONS: None of the investigated factors were shown to influence the distribution of bacterial pathogens. The majority of SSIs were caused by staphylococci, and S. pseudintermedius was the most prevalent pathogen. Based on the study results, use of first-line antimicrobials prior to receiving culture and susceptibility results is a rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for the studied dog population.
TI  - A bioengineered nisin derivative to control biofilms of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance and the shortage of novel antimicrobials are among the biggest challenges facing society. One of the major factors contributing to resistance is the use of frontline clinical antibiotics in veterinary practice. In order to properly manage dwindling antibiotic resources, we must identify antimicrobials that are specifically targeted to veterinary applications. Nisin is a member of the lantibiotic family of antimicrobial peptides that exhibit potent antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria, including human and animal pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, and Clostridium. Although not currently used in human medicine, nisin is already employed commercially as an anti-mastitis product in the veterinary field. Recently we have used bioengineering strategies to enhance the activity of nisin against several high profile targets, including multi-drug resistant clinical pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and also against staphylococci and streptococci associated with bovine mastitis. However, newly emerging pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) pose a significant threat in terms of veterinary health and as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance determinants. In this study we created a nisin derivative with enhanced antimicrobial activity against S. pseudintermedius. In addition, the novel nisin derivative exhibits an enhanced ability to impair biofilm formation and to reduce the density of established biofilms. The activities of this peptide represent a significant improvement over that of the wild-type nisin peptide and merit further investigation with a view to their use to treat S. pseudintermedius infections.
TI  - Susceptibility in vitro of canine methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcal isolates to fusidic acid, chlorhexidine and miconazole: opportunities for topical therapy of canine superficial pyoderma.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing multidrug resistance amongst canine pathogenic staphylococci has renewed interest in topical antibacterial therapy for skin infections in the context of responsible veterinary prescribing. We therefore determined the activity in vitro of three clinically relevant topical agents and synergism between two of them against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: The MICs of fusidic acid (n = 199), chlorhexidine (n = 198), miconazole (n = 198) and a 1:1 combination of miconazole/chlorhexidine (n = 198) were determined for canine isolates [50 MRSA and 49 methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), 50 MSSA and 50 methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP)] collected from the UK and Germany using an agar dilution method (CLSI VET01-A4). Fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices were calculated to assess the interaction of miconazole with chlorhexidine. RESULTS: MICs of each drug/combination were significantly (P < 0.0005) higher for S. aureus when compared with S. pseudintermedius. Most strains (n = 172) had an MIC of fusidic acid of </=0.03 mg/L (MIC >/=64 mg/L, n = 5 MRSA). All strains had MICs of chlorhexidine of 0.5-4 mg/L, except for one MRSA (MIC = 8 mg/L). All but four strains had MICs of miconazole of 1-4 mg/L (MIC = 16 mg/L, n = 3; MIC = 256 mg/L, n = 1). Miconazole/chlorhexidine (1:1 ratio) had a synergistic effect against 49/50 MRSA, 31/50 MSSA, 12/49 MRSP and 23/49 MSSP. CONCLUSIONS: Since the majority of these staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant isolates, had MICs that should be readily exceeded by topical skin application of these agents, their therapeutic efficacy for canine superficial pyoderma should be assessed. The synergistic interaction shown in vitro supports further clinical evaluation of miconazole/chlorhexidine combination therapy for staphylococcal infection.
TI  - An evaluation of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass  spectrometry for the identification of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from canine infections.
AB  - It has been proposed, based on taxonomic and molecular studies, that all canine isolates belonging to Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG) should be renamed Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. However, isolates of SIG and other coagulase-positive staphylococci share many phenotypic characteristics, which could lead to misidentification. The accuracy of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for identifying S. pseudintermedius isolates obtained from canine infections was evaluated, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based identification as the gold standard. In addition, MALDI-TOF MS was compared with conventional biochemical tests. A central problem was the incorrect identification of S. pseudintermedius isolates as S. intermedius by either MALDI-TOF MS or biochemical identification. From the 49 S. pseudintermedius isolates identified by the molecular method, only 21 could be assigned to this species by the biochemical approach and only 12 by MALDI-TOF MS. The 6 S. aureus isolates were correctly identified by all 3 techniques. However, using biochemical tests, 9 S. pseudintermedius were mistakenly classified as S. aureus, indicating a reduced specificity relative to the MALDI-TOF MS system. Analysis with the MALDI-TOF MS platform allowed rapid and accurate identification of the 49 isolates to the S. intermedius group but the approach was very limited in identifying S. pseudintermedius isolates, as only 12 of 49 isolates were correctly identified, a sensitivity of 0.24 (95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.39).
TI  - Anatomical patterns of colonization of pets with staphylococcal species in homes  of people with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin or soft tissue infection (SSTI).
AB  - Methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), and other pathogenic staphylococci can cause infections in companion animals and humans. Identification of colonized animals is fundamental to research and practice needs, but harmonized methods have not yet been established. To establish the optimal anatomic site for the recovery of methicillin-resistant coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS), survey data and swabs were collected from 196 pets (dogs, cats, reptiles, birds, fish and pocket pets) that lived in households with an MRSA-infected person. Using broth-enrichment culture and PCR for speciation, S. aureus was identified in 27 of 179 (15%) pets sampled at baseline and 19 of 125 (15%) pets sampled at a three-month follow-up home visit. S. pseudintermedius was isolated from 33 of 179 (18%) pets sampled at baseline and 21 of 125 (17%) of pets sampled at follow-up. The baseline MRSA and MRSP prevalence was 8% and 1% respectively from 145 mammalian pets. The follow-up MRSA and MRSP prevalence was 7% and <1% respectively from 95 mammalian pets. The mouth was the most sensitive single site sampled for isolation of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius in mammals. In a subset of pets, from which all available isolates were identified, dual carriage of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius was 22% at baseline and 11% at follow-up. These results identify the mouth as the most sensitive site to screen for pathogenic staphylococci and suggest that it should be included in sampling protocols.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius can be misdiagnosed as Staphylococcus aureus in humans with dog bite wounds.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether S. pseudintermedius is misdiagnosed as S. aureus by clinical laboratories when isolated from humans with dog bite wounds. In addition, we attempted to determine whether S. pseudintermedius isolates related to dog bite wounds share phenotypic and genotypic traits. S. pseudintermedius was identified by PCR targeting the nuc gene. Isolates were tested for antibiotic susceptibility using VetMIC GP-mo microdilution panels. The occurrence of genes encoding leukocidins, exfoliatins, pyrogenic toxin superantigens and enterotoxins was determined by PCR. The relatedness of S. pseudintermedius isolates was investigated using Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). Out of 101 isolates defined as S. aureus by human clinical microbiology laboratories, 13 isolates were re-identified as S. pseudintermedius and one isolate was confirmed to carry the mecA gene, i.e. methicillin-resistant (MRSP). The MRSP isolate was also defined as multi-resistant. Two methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius isolates were also multi-resistant and five were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. With the exception of three S. pseudintermedius isolates belonging to multi locus sequence type (MLST) 158, all the isolates belonged to unique STs. All isolates contained lukS/F-I, siet and se-int, and expA were identified in two isolates and expB and sec canine-sel in one isolate respectively. S. pseudintermedius is frequently misdiagnosed as S. aureus from humans with dog bite wounds showing that it can act as an opportunistic pathogen in humans. No common phenotypic and genotypic traits shared by the S. pseudintermedius isolates could be identified.
TI  - Nasal carriage of coagulase positive staphylococci in patients of a Primary-Healthcare-Center: genetic lineages and resistance and virulence genes.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius are highly important due to their capacity for producing diseases in humans and animals, respectively. The aim of the study was to investigate and characterize the coagulase positive Staphylococcus (CoPS) carriage in a Primary Healthcare Center population. METHODS: Nasal swabs were obtained from 281 non-infectious patients. The CoPS isolates recovered were typed, and their resistance phenotype and genotype, as well as their virulence profiles, were analyzed. RESULTS: CoPS isolates were recovered from 56/281 patients (19.9%). Fifty-five were S. aureus (19.6%), 54 were methicillin susceptible (MSSA) and one was methicillin resistant (MRSA). The remaining isolate was S. pseudintermedius (0.4%). A high diversity of spa-types (n=40) was detected, with 6 of them being new ones. The multi-locus-sequence-typing of 13 MSSA and one MRSA selected isolates was performed and the STs detected were: ST8, ST15, ST30, ST34, ST121, ST146, ST398, ST554, ST942, ST2499, and ST2500 (the last two STs being new). One MSSA isolate was typed as t1197-ST398-(Clonal complex)CC398. The MRSA isolate was typed as t002-ST146-CC5-SCCmec-IVc, and exhibited a multiresistance phenotype. The detected resistances were: penicillin (76%), macrolides (7%), tetracycline (7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (7%), quinolones (7%), and lincosamides (5%). Five isolates contained lukF/lukS-PV genes, 17 tst gene, one eta gene, and two etb gene. The S. pseudintermedius isolate presented a new spa-type (t57) (belonging to a new ST180) and the genes lukS/F-I, siet, se-int, and expB. CONCLUSIONS: A high genetic diversity of S. aureus was detected. Mention must be made of the identification of MSSA CC398 and S. pseudintermedius isolates in two patients, one of them with animal contact. The detection of the genes lukF/lukS-PV and tst should be noted.
TI  - Apo, Zn2+-bound and Mn2+-bound structures reveal ligand-binding properties of SitA from the pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - The Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a leading cause of canine bacterial pyoderma, resulting in worldwide morbidity in dogs. S. pseudintermedius also causes life-threatening human infections. Furthermore, methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius is emerging, resembling the human health threat of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore it is increasingly important to characterize targets for intervention strategies to counteract S. pseudintermedius infections. Here we used biophysical methods, mutagenesis, and X-ray crystallography, to define the ligand-binding properties and structure of SitA, an S. pseudintermedius surface lipoprotein. SitA was strongly and specifically stabilized by Mn2+ and Zn2+ ions. Crystal structures of SitA complexed with Mn2+ and Zn2+ revealed a canonical class III solute-binding protein with the metal cation bound in a cavity between N- and C-terminal lobes. Unexpectedly, one crystal contained both apo- and holo-forms of SitA, revealing a large side-chain reorientation of His64, and associated structural differences accompanying ligand binding. Such conformational changes may regulate fruitful engagement of the cognate ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter system (SitBC) required for metal uptake. These results provide the first detailed characterization and mechanistic insights for a potential therapeutic target of the major canine pathogen S. pseudintermedius, and also shed light on homologous structures in related staphylococcal pathogens afflicting humans.
TI  - Characterisation of bacterial growth and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in canine urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common reason for antimicrobial therapy in dogs. A reported increase in multi-drug resistance in canine bacterial pathogens, including resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESC) is of concern as antimicrobial resistance complicates therapy in dogs. In addition, it is a possible public health concern. The objectives of this study were to investigate the relative prevalence of pathogens in urine samples from dogs with urinary tract infection sampled at referral hospitals, clinics and mixed veterinary practices and to investigate if this was influenced by sample material or by contamination of the culture. The second objective was to assess the susceptibility patterns to clinically relevant antimicrobials and to investigate if this was influenced by whether the samples originated from smaller clinics or from referral hospitals and to perform active screening for the presence of Enterobacteriaceae resistant to ESC. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated pathogen (68%) followed by staphylococci (11%). E. coli isolates were found significantly more often in pure culture than in contaminated samples. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus isolates were significantly more prevalent in pre-incubated samples compared to samples submitted as non-incubated media. Susceptibility to the majority of the tested first-line antimicrobials was common. Multiresistance was rare, and these isolates were all susceptible to at least one relevant antimicrobial. Isolates in samples from small animal clinics or mixed veterinary practices were less likely to be susceptible compared to isolates originating from referral animal hospitals. ESC-resistant Enterobacteriacae isolates were found in one per cent of the positive cultures. Bacteria with transferable ESC resistance were confirmed in one dog. The gene demonstrated was bla CMY2. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of sample material might influence the possibility of detecting Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus isolates in clinical cases of UTI in dogs. Based on the study results, use of first-line antimicrobials is a rational empirical antimicrobial therapy for the studied dog population. E. coli was the most prevalent pathogen, but prevalence of infection with ESC resistant Enterobacteriaceae including E. coli was low, as such isolates were found in only one per cent of the positive cultures.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus in dogs with keratitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of, and risk factors for, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus (MRS) isolation in dogs with naturally acquired bacterial keratitis. PROCEDURES: All Staphylococcus spp. isolated from corneal samples of dogs with keratitis during a 2-year period were evaluated for methicillin resistance by bacteriologic methods. Each MRS isolate was subjected to in vitro susceptibility testing for systemic and ocular antimicrobials. Nasal swabs for culture were collected from all dogs with MRS corneal isolation to evaluate for nasal carrier status. Potential risk factors for MRS isolation were investigated by medical record review and administration of an epidemiological survey to dog owners. Collected information characterizing animal, client, and environmental variables was analyzed for association with MRS isolation. RESULTS: Seventy-one Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from seventy individual dogs with keratitis during the study period. Seventeen of the Staphylococcus isolates (23.9%) were methicillin resistant. The MRS isolates included Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 10), Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (n = 6), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1). The MRS corneal isolates displayed extensive antimicrobial resistance. Four dogs (23.5%) with MRS corneal isolates had positive nasal cultures for MRS. Client occupation was significantly (P = 0.01) associated with MRS isolation, and dogs belonging to owners employed in veterinary or human healthcare fields were four times more likely to have MRS keratitis than dogs owned by clients with different professions. There were no significant associations between the other evaluated animal, client, and environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin resistance is relatively common in Staphylococcus isolates from dogs with corneal infections, particularly among dogs belonging to healthcare workers.
TI  - Amikacin resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from dogs.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the most common microorganism isolated from canine pyoderma and postoperative wound infections. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) has increased, and recently, isolates that are resistant not only to methicillin but also to other classes of antibiotic drugs, including aminoglycosides, have become common. A total of 422 S. pseudintermedius isolates collected from 413 dogs were analyzed for amikacin and methicillin resistance using broth microdilution and disk diffusion testing. Methicillin-resistant isolates were significantly (P < 0.0001) more likely to be resistant to amikacin (37%, 31/84) than were methicillin-susceptible isolates (7%, 22/338). Additionally, resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics was significantly associated with resistance to amikacin irrespective of methicillin resistance. Among the 422 isolates, 32 that tested positive for amikacin resistance by broth microdilution or disk diffusion testing were investigated further for the presence of aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme genes using multiplex PCR. Of these isolates, 66% (21/32) were methicillin resistant. In contrast to previous studies of Staphylococcus aureus, the most prevalent gene detected was aph(3')-IIIa found in 75% (24/32) of isolates followed by aac(6')/aph(2") and ant(4')-Ia in 12% (4/32) and 3% (1/32), respectively. Understanding the differences in antimicrobial resistance gene carriage between different species of Staphylococcus may improve antimicrobial drug selection for clinical therapy and provide insights into how resistance develops in S. pseudintermedius.
TI  - Nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among Swiss  veterinary health care providers: detection of livestock- and healthcare-associated clones.
AB  - We screened a total of 340 veterinarians (including general practitioners, small  animal practitioners, large animal practitioners, veterinarians working in different veterinary services or industry), and 29 veterinary assistants for nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) at the 2012 Swiss veterinary annual meeting. MRSA isolates (n = 14) were detected in 3.8 % (95 % CI 2.1 - 6.3 %) of the participants whereas MRSP was not detected. Large animal practitioners were carriers of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) ST398-t011-V (n = 2), ST398-t011-IV (n = 4), and ST398-t034-V (n = 1). On the other hand, participants working with small animals harbored human healthcare-associated MRSA (HCA-MRSA) which belonged to epidemic lineages ST225-t003-II (n = 2), ST225-t014-II (n = 1), ST5-t002-II (n = 2), ST5-t283-IV (n = 1), and ST88-t186-IV (n = 1). HCA-MRSA harbored virulence factors such as enterotoxins, beta-hemolysin converting phage and leukocidins. None of the MRSA isolates carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL). In addition to the methicillin resistance gene mecA, LA-MRSA ST398 isolates generally contained additional antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance to tetracycline [tet(M) and tet(K)], trimethoprim [dfrK, dfrG], and the aminoglycosides gentamicin and kanamycin [aac(6')-Ie - aph(2')-Ia]. On the other hand, HCA-MRSA ST5 and ST225 mainly contained genes conferring resistance to the macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin B antibiotics [erm(A)], to spectinomycin [ant(9)-Ia], amikacin and tobramycin [ant(4')-Ia], and to fluoroquinolones [amino acid substitutions in GrlA (S84L) and GyrA (S80F and S81P)]. MRSA carriage may represent an occupational risk and veterinarians should be aware of possible MRSA colonization and potential for developing infection or for transmitting these strains. Professional exposure to animals should be reported upon hospitalization and before medical intervention to allow for preventive measures. Infection prevention measures are also indicated in veterinary medicine to avoid MRSA transmission between humans and animals, and to limit the spread of MRSA both in the community, and to animal and human hospitals.
TI  - Strain typing and antimicrobial susceptibility of methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococcal species in dogs and people associated with dogs in Thailand.
AB  - AIMS: This study was to investigate and to characterize methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci (MRCoPS) harboring in dogs and people associated with dogs in Thailand. METHODS AND RESULTS: Staphylococci were collected from 100 dogs, 100 dog owners, 200 small animal veterinarians and 100 people without pet association. Species of MRCoPS were identified phenotypically and genotypically. Molecular characteristics were determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and SCCmec typing, and antimicrobial susceptibility was assayed by broth microdilution and by microarray analysis for resistance genes. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans (MRSSc) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were isolated from dogs (45, 17 and 1%, respectively), veterinarians (8, 2 and 1.5%, respectively) and dog owners (3, 2 and 0%, respectively). Seventeen sequence types (STs) were identified among 83 MRSP isolates which specifically carried SCCmec V, II-III, PsiSCCmec57395 and three uncharacterized SCCmec types. MRSP ST 45, 68 and novel STs including 169, 178, 181 and 183 were shared among canine and human isolates. Most of MRSA ST398 and MRSSc carried SCCmec type V. The MRCoPS commonly displayed multiple resistances to tested antimicrobials and carried various resistance genes. CONCLUSION: Variety of MRCoPS, especially new MRSP clones, distributed in dogs and people in Thailand. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The existence of MRCoPS circulating between dogs and humans in Thailand provides indirect evidence of interspecies transmission and represents a potential public health hazard.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius for CAMP-test.
AB  - CAMP test reliably detects Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus, GBS); it is traditionally performed streaking the tested isolate perpendicularly to Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), provided that reference Sa strains (that produce beta-hemolysin) are used. In a zone of beta-hemolysin activity, in fact, GBS and Lm form typical arrow-shaped hemolytic areas. While Sa production of the toxin is strain-dependent, however, that of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (Sp), a pet-owner colonizer and an emerging human pathogen, is constitutive, then observed in all clinical isolates. Therefore, Sp may indeed represent a valid alternative to perform the assay.
TI  - Diversity and evolution of oligopeptide permease systems in staphylococcal species.
AB  - Several oligopeptide permease (Opp) systems have been found in staphylococcal species, including Opp1-4, Opp3' and the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME)-encoded Opp system (ACME-Opp). They confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. In this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of Opp systems in staphylococcal species. Novel Opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of Opp4 in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the ACME-Opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the identified Opp systems were derived from Opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of Opp in staphylococci. In addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of ACME: the Opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly transferred from Staphylococcus haemolyticus to Staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in S. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Synergistic hemolysis between beta-lysin-producing Staphylococcus species and Rothia nasimurium in primary cultures of clinical specimens obtained from dogs.
AB  - Nonhemolytic isolates of catalase-positive, Gram-positive cocci were observed that produced strong synergistic hemolysis with colonies of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans in primary cultures of clinical specimens from dogs. The isolates appeared similar to nonhemolytic staphylococci but were not identified with conventional biochemical tests or commercial biochemical test kits. Partial 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences from each of 9 tested isolates were nearly identical to that of Rothia nasimurium. The isolates produced positive Christie-Atkins-Munch-Peterson test reactions with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC strain 25923) and Staphylococcus intermedius Hajek (ATCC strain 49052). The latter was identified in the current study as S. pseudintermedius. Rothia nasimurium appears to be a previously unreported commensal organism in dogs. Its potential significance as an opportunistic contributor to polymicrobial infections in dogs is not known.
TI  - Carriage of methicillin-resistant staphylococci by healthy companion animals in the US.
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant staphylococci have been associated with wounded or ill companion animals, but little is known about the prevalence of resistant staphylococci among healthy animals. In this study, 276 healthy dogs and cats from veterinary clinics were tested for the presence of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus spp. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and the presence of select resistance genes, and typed using Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius were also characterized using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing and SCCmec typing. Approximately 5% (14/276) of the animals were positive by enrichment for five species of staphylococci [Staph. aureus (n = 11), Staph. pseudintermedius (n = 4), Staphylococcus sciuri (n = 6), Staphylococcus simulans (n = 1) and Staphylococcus warneri (n = 1)]. Seventy-eight per cent (18/23) of staphylococci were resistant to oxacillin and also multidrug resistant (resistance to >/= 2 antimicrobials). All Staph. aureus isolates were mecA+ and blaZ+, SCCmec type II, spa type t002, ST5 and clonal using PFGE. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius were SCCmec type IV or V, spa type t06 and ST170; two of the isolates were pvl(+) . These results suggest that healthy companion animals may be a reservoir of multidrug-resistant staphylococci, which may be transferred to owners and others who handle companion animals. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, antimicrobial-resistant coagulase-negative and coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from various body sites on healthy dogs and cats. Resistance to 14 antimicrobials was observed including resistance to oxacillin; the majority of staphylococci were also multidrug resistant. Results from this study suggest that healthy dogs and cats may act as reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that may be transferred to people by simple interaction with the animals. Such carriage poses an underlying risk of infection, which should be considered during handling of healthy dogs and cats by pet owners and veterinary personnel.
TI  - Carriage of Staphylococcus species in the veterinary visiting dog population in mainland UK: molecular characterisation of resistance and virulence.
AB  - This study investigated the prevalence of nasal carriage of staphylococci in dogs and determined the characteristics of the isolates. A total of 724 dogs from 87 veterinary practices across the mainland UK were screened for carriage of Staphylococcus spp. All isolates were examined for meticillin resistance (MR) and the presence of the mecA gene investigated in those isolates showing resistance. All coagulase-positive staphylococci and MR coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Spa typing and DNA microarray analysis of resistance and virulence genes was carried out on all MR S. aureus (MRSA) and a subset of meticillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Staphylococci were isolated from 399 (55.1%) of the dogs; only seven (1%) carried MRSA, all of which were identified as the dominant UK healthcare-associated strain (EMRSA-15, ST22). MSSA was identified in 47 (6.5%) dogs, the sequence types of which have been suggested as precursors to successful MRSA clones. Forty (5.5%) dogs carried MRCoNS, while no dogs carried MR S. pseudintermedius, although this is increasingly reported in mainland Europe. Resistance to antimicrobials among the isolates varied between species, with multidrug resistance (MDR) in 87.5% of MRCoNS and 21.8% of coagulase positive staphylococci. Microarray analysis of MRSA and a subset of MSSA isolates identified numerous virulence genes associated with pathogenesis, which are commonly identified in isolates of human origin. However, no isolates carried Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. This study suggests that MRSA carriage is low in the vet visiting dog population, but there is a diverse range of virulence and resistance determinants in canine S. aureus and MRCoNS isolates.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from companion animals and environment in the veterinary teaching hospital in Zambia, Africa.
AB  - The Republic of Zambia consists of only one veterinary teaching school at the University of Zambia (UNZA) where students and veterinarians are exposed to many bacterial pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SP). The aim of this study was the characterization and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of eleven SA and 48 SP isolates from the veterinary hospitals' in- and outpatients and the environment. No isolate was resistant to cefoxitin by disk diffusion test and the corresponding resistance gene mecA was not found. In contrast, the resistance rates of SA to penicillin (63.6%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (36.4%) and SP to penicillin (52.1%) and tetracycline (25.0%) were the highest. A variety of sequence types (STs) without a predominant type including numerous novel types were determined, especially for SP (39.6%). The spa typing provided a clonal assignment for all SAs (100%) and 24 SPs (50%) with three and two novel types, respectively. This study has provided an overview of SA and SP in the veterinary teaching hospital at UNZA. However, for a better understanding of these species regarding pathogenesis and transmission, further studies on the prevalence and characterization of SA and SP from veterinary staff, pet owners, and farm animals in Zambia is needed.
TI  - Staphylococcus intermedius infections: case report and literature review.
AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius is part of the normal skin and oral flora of dogs. Case reports of human infections are rare, but the true incidence is unknown because the pathogen is frequently misidentified as Staphylococcus aureus. Reported cases range from soft tissue infections to brain abscess. Most reported cases in humans have been related to dog exposure. We report a case of a 73 year old female with S. intermedius surgical wound infection one month following a left elbow total arthroplasty. This is the first reported human case of S. intermedius infection of a mechanical prosthesis. The presumed source of infection was the patient's dog. The patient was treated with vancomycin, then switched to cefazolin and rifampin once susceptibilities were known. Case reports suggest that patients generally respond well to tailored antibiotics with complete or near-complete recovery. S. intermedius should be included in the differential diagnosis of invasive infection amongst patients with close contact with dogs.
TI  - Small colony variant of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius ST71 presenting as a sticky phenotype.
AB  - We first observed the phenomenon of small colony variants (SCVs) in a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius sequence type 71 (ST71) strain, isolated from a non-pet owner. Although we found that small-sized colonies share main features with Staphylococcus aureus SCVs, they nevertheless show a novel, particular, and sticky phenotype, whose expression was extremely stable, even after subcultivation.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance and characterisation of staphylococci isolated from healthy Labrador retrievers in the United Kingdom.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-positive (CoPS) and coagulase-negative (CoNS) staphylococci are normal commensals of the skin and mucosa, but are also opportunist pathogens. Meticillin-resistant (MR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are increasing in human and veterinary healthcare. Healthy humans and other animals harbour a variety of staphylococci, including MR-CoPS and MR-CoNS. The main aims of the study were to characterise the population and antimicrobial resistance profiles of staphylococci from healthy non-vet visiting and non-antimicrobial treated Labrador retrievers in the UK. RESULTS: Nasal and perineal samples were collected from 73 Labrador retrievers; staphylococci isolated and identified using phenotypic and biochemical methods. They were also confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), PCR of the nuc gene and PCR and sequencing of the tuf gene. Disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) susceptibility tests were determined for a range of antimicrobials. In total, 102 CoPS (S. pseudintermedius n = 91, S. aureus n = 11) and 334 CoNS isolates were detected from 99% of dogs in this study. In 52% of dogs CoNS only were detected, with both CoNS and CoPS detected in 43% dogs and CoPS only detected in 4% of dogs. Antimicrobial resistance was not common among CoPS, but at least one MDR-CoNS isolate was detected in 34% of dogs. MR-CoNS were detected from 42% of dogs but no MR-CoPS were isolated. S. epidermidis (52% of dogs) was the most common CoNS found followed by S. warneri (30%) and S. equorum (27%), with another 15 CoNS species isolated from </= 15% of dogs. S. pseudintermedius and S. aureus were detected in 44% and 8% of dogs respectively. CONCLUSIONS: MR- and MDR-CoPS were rare. However a high prevalence of MR- and MDR-CoNS were found in these dogs, even though they had no prior antimicrobial treatment or admission to veterinary premises. These findings are of concern due to the potential for opportunistic infections, zoonotic transmission and transmission of antimicrobial resistant determinants from these bacteria to coagulase positive staphylococci.
TI  - Canine superficial bacterial folliculitis: current understanding of its etiology, diagnosis and treatment.
AB  - Superficial bacterial folliculitis (SBF) is more common in the dog than other mammalian species. Until recently, a successful outcome in cases of canine SBF was possible by administering a potentiated amoxicillin, a first generation cephalosporin or a potentiated sulfonamide. Unfortunately, this predictable susceptibility has changed, because methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are becoming more prevalent in canine SBF cases. The increasing frequency of multidrug resistance complicates the selection of antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobial agents that were once rarely used in cases of canine SBF, such as amikacin, rifampicin and chloramphenicol, are becoming the drugs of choice, based on bacterial culture and susceptibility testing. Furthermore, changes in antimicrobial susceptibility have helped to re-emphasize the importance of a multimodal approach to treatment of the disease, including topical therapy. Due to the increasing frequency of identification of highly resistant Staphylococcus spp., topical antimicrobial therapy, including the use of diluted sodium hypochlorite (bleach), is becoming necessary to successfully treat some cases of canine SBF. Other important antiseptics that can be used include chlorhexidine, benzoyl peroxide, ethyl lactate, triclosan and boric acid/acetic acid. This review discusses the diagnostic and therapeutic management of canine SBF, with a special emphasis on treating methicillin resistant staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. in the conjunctival sac of healthy dogs.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of selected coagulase-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRS) in the conjunctival sac in a group of healthy dogs and to compare the prevalence of ocular MRS colonization with colonization of typically assessed body sites including the nasal cavity and rectum. ANIMALS STUDIED: 123 healthy dogs were used in the prevalence study: 40 dogs from a shelter and 83 privately owned dogs. PROCEDURES: The sampling procedure included culturing three separate sites per subject in the following order: the lower conjunctival fornices, the nares, and rectum. RESULTS: A low prevalence of 1.6% (2/123) of MRS was detected in healthy dogs. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from two dogs, one from a conjunctival swab and the other from a rectal swab. CONCLUSION: The survey data indicate the ocular surface is a potential site of MRS colonization, although the prevalence was low in healthy dogs.
TI  - Canine antimicrobial peptides are effective against resistant bacteria and yeasts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small proteins present in most living species and they are involved in the defence against pathogenic organisms. beta-Defensins and cathelicidin are the most frequently studied AMPs in both people and dogs. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration of two canine beta-defensins and a cathelicidin against antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and yeasts using a broth microdilution method. METHODS: The micro-organisms tested were ATCC strains of meticillin-sensitive and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively), meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MSSP), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Malassezia pachydermatis. Field strains of meticillin-resistant S, pseudintermedius (MRSP, n = 1) and MSSP (n = 11) were also tested. Mann-Whitney U-test and Friedman test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The MSSP and MRSP were more susceptible to canine AMPs than MSSA and MRSA. Malassezia pachydermatis was more sensitive than C. albicans to canine AMPs. The beta-defensin cBD103 was most effective against Staphylococci and P. aeruginosa, while the cathelicidin cCath was the most effective AMP against E. coli. Additionally, cBD103 was the most effective AMP for both yeasts studied, with M. pachydermatis being more susceptible than C. albicans. All AMPs tested exhibited killing within 2 h of exposure. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: We demonstrated that natural canine AMPs are effective against canine-specific pathogens, are equally effective against meticillin-resistant or -susceptible strains, and are more effective against M. pachydermatis than against C. albicans organisms.
TI  - Characterisation of a catalase-negative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolate from a dog.
AB  - A catalase-negative MRSA strain and a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strain (MRSP) were isolated from a dog affected by a severe form of pododermatitis. The catalase negative isolate was typed as SCCmec I, PVL negative, ST5 t002 strain. A deletion at position 487 of the kat gene altered the functionality of the catalase enzyme. This is the first report of a catalase-negative MRSA in animals. As catalase test is a rapid assay routinely employed for the identification of staphylococci in clinical microbiology laboratories, the presence of MRSA with this uncommon phenotype may be underestimated. Moreover, catalase-negative staphylococci should be investigated more in-depth in order to assess their virulence.
TI  - An investigation of resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials among staphylococci  isolated from pigs with exudative epidermitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high proportion of staphylococci isolated from pigs affected with exudative epidermitis were found to be resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials. The primary objective of this research was to investigate and characterize beta-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococci isolated from these pigs. RESULTS: The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 240 staphylococci isolates were determined by disk diffusion, of which 176 (73.3%) of the isolates were resistant to 3 beta-lactams (penicillin G, ampicillin, and ceftiofur). The presence of mecA gene was identified in 63 staphylococci isolates from skin samples by PCR. The mecA gene was identified in 19 S. aureus, 31 S. hyicus, 9 Staphylococcus chromogenes, 2 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates, and in 1 isolate each of Staphylococcus arlettae, and Staphylococcus cohnii subspecies urealyticus. From SCCmec typing results, the majority (45/63, 71.4%) were shown to be SCCmec type V. One isolate was SCCmec III. Fourteen isolates were detected as mec class A, mec class C or ccr type 5. The ccr complex and mec complex was not detected in 3 isolates of methicillin resistant S. hyicus (MRSH) based on multiplex PCR. Of the 30 isolates of MRSA identified from nasal samples of the pigs, 29 isolates were SCCmec type V and 1 isolate was SCCmec type II. Staphyloccoci isolates that were mecA negative but resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials were further examined by screening for mecC, however all were negative. Furthermore, the majority of mecA negative beta-lactam resistant staphylococci isolates were susceptible to oxacillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in a double disk diffusion test. CONCLUSIONS: Methicillin resistance can be identified in a variety of staphylococcal species isolated from pigs. In this study there was a great deal of similarity in the SCCmec types between staphylococcal species, suggesting that resistance may be passed from one species of staphylococci to another species of staphylococci. While this has been reported for acquisition of methicillin-resistance from coagulase negative staphylococci to S. aureus, these data suggest that transmission to or from the porcine pathogen S. hyicus may also occur. The identification of methicillin resistance in a variety of staphylococcal species in pigs does raise concerns about the spread of serious multi-drug resistance in food producing animals and warrants further study.
TI  - An in vitro study to determine the minimal bactericidal concentration of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) required to inhibit meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strains isolated from canine skin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is becoming a more common pathogen in animals treated in veterinary hospitals, raising concerns for transmission and possible contamination of the hospital itself. The identification of effective agents for the decontamination of veterinary patients and hospitals is crucial. Sodium hypochlorite (6.15%) or 'bleach' is an inexpensive and frequently used decontamination agent in human and veterinary hospitals and an adjunctive treatment for human patients. There are no published data on the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of sodium hypochlorite (6.15%) for MRSP. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the MBC of sodium hypochlorite (6.15%) against MRSP strains isolated from canine skin. METHODS: In this in vitro study, 12 canine skin isolates were obtained from the Antech Diagnostics microbiology department. Twofold serial dilutions of sodium hypochlorite (6.15%) were allowed to react with each of the MRSP strains for 15 min, followed by overnight incubation on agar plates. Colonies on each plate were counted. This process was repeated in triplicate. RESULTS: The overall MBC for the canine skin-isolated MRSP strains was 1:32, but most strains had an MBC between 1:64 and 1:128 dilution. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: This study shows that sodium hypochlorite (6.15%) is an effective agent for decontamination at easily achievable concentrations.
TI  - Evaluation of the affinity of various species and strains of Staphylococcus to adhere to equine corneocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain USA 500 predominately colonizes horses and people working with them. Previous studies demonstrate that some Staphylococcus species exhibit higher affinity for corneocytes of specific mammalian species. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the relative affinities of various MRSA strains, meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strains and a meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MSSP) for equine corneocytes. We hypothesized that MRSA strain USA 500 would exhibit greater adhesion than other staphylococcal strains tested. METHODS: Epidemic MRSA strains (USA 100, USA 300, USA 500 and USA 800), two MSSA control strains and an MSSP field strain were tested on corneocytes from 15 client-owned horses. Isolates were incubated with corneocytes in conditions (bacterial concentration of 10(8) colony-forming units/mL for 45 min) recently shown to maximize adherence of S. aureus without competitive interference. A validated image-analysis system was used to quantify the cell surface density of bacterial adhesion. RESULTS: The MSSP strain adhered with significantly higher affinity (P < 0.0015) to corneocytes than did MSSA strains. All MRSA strains other than USA 500 had significantly higher affinity than MSSA strains (P range <0.03 to <0.0015). There were no statistical differences in adhesion between strain USA 500 and the other MRSA strains tested. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Meticillin-resistant S. aureus strain USA 500 did not adhere more robustly than other strains of Staphylococcus; therefore, its affinity to colonize horses may not be solely attributed to corneocyte adhesion. Additional studies are required to explain the epidemiological role of this strain as the predominant cause of colonization and infections of horses in North America.
TI  - First report in South America of companion animal colonization by the USA1100 clone of community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ST30) and by the European clone of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (ST71).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant staphylococci can colonize and cause diseases in companion animals. Unfortunately, few molecular studies have been carried out in Brazil and other countries with the aim of characterizing these isolates. Consequently, little is known about the potential role of companion animals in transmitting these resistant bacteria to humans. In this work we searched for mecA gene among Staphylococcus isolates obtained from nasal microbiota of 130 healthy dogs and cats attended in a veterinary clinic located in the west region of Rio de Janeiro. The isolates recovered were identified to the species level and characterized using molecular tools. RESULTS: A community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) isolate related to USA1100 (Southwest Pacific clone) and susceptible to all non-beta-lactams was detected in a cat (1.7%, 1/60). Another coagulase-positive isolate harboring mecA was recovered from a dog (1.4%, 1/70) and identified as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) related to the European clone (ST71). The two isolates of Staphylococcus conhii subsp. urealyticus (1.4%, 1/70 dogs and 1.7%, 1/60 cats), similarly to the MRSP isolate, also presented high-level multiresistance. The majority of the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci recovered were Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5.7%, 4/70 dogs and 6.7%, 4/60 cats) and all clustered into the same PFGE type. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that mecA-harboring Staphylococcus isolates are common members of the nasal microbiota of the healthy companion animals studied (9.2%, 12/130 animals), including some high-level multiresistant isolates of S. pseudintermedius and S. conhii subsp. urealyticus. The detection, for the first time in South America, of USA1100-related CA-MRSA and of ST71 MRSP (European clone), colonizing companion animals, is of concern. Both S. pseudintermedius and S. aureus are important agents of infections for animals. The USA1100 CA-MRSA is a causative of severe and disseminated diseases in healthy children and adults. Additionally, MRSP is a nosocomial pathogen in veterinarian settings. It had already been demonstrated that the virulent ST71 MRSP is geographically spread over Europe and USA, with potential for zoonotic infections.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of DispersinB on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius biofilm.
AB  - Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is an important canine pathogen that has been shown to produce biofilm in vitro. Biofilm production may be an important virulence factor and methods to eliminate biofilm-associated infections are required. An enzyme of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, DispersinB, has been shown to degrade the extracellular matrix in the biofilm of a variety of bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of DispersinB on MRSP biofilm production and eradication in vitro. A quantitative microtitre plate assay was used to assess the impact of DispersinB on 30 MRSP isolates from dogs. While DispersinB did not have any effect on MRSP growth (P=0.98), it reduced biofilm formation (P=0.0002) and degraded established biofilm (P=0.0001). These data indicate that in vivo study of the effect of this enzyme in indicated to determine if it may be a useful treatment option for MRSP biofilm-associated infections.
TI  - Animal and human Staphylococcus aureus associated clonal lineages and high rate of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius novel lineages in Spanish kennel dogs: predominance of S. aureus ST398.
AB  - Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MSSP) are gaining interest to track the evolution of emerging methicillin-resistant strains in animals and humans. We focused on the characterization of the methicillin-susceptible coagulase-positive staphylococci (MSCoPS) recovered from nasal samples of 98 healthy kennel-dogs. Isolates were typed by spa, agr, MLST and SmaI/ApaI-PFGE. Antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiles were investigated. Presence of the human-associated Immune-Evasion-Cluster (IEC) genes was analyzed in MSSA. Twenty-four MSSA, 16 MSSP and one MS Staphylococcus schleiferi subspecies coagulans were obtained. Thirteen spa-types and 12 sequence-types (STs) were detected among MSSA, with ST398 predominance (7/24, 29.2%). MSSA isolates were enclosed within 6 clonal complexes (no. of isolates): CC5 (8), CC398 (7), CC88 (4), CC45 (2), CC133 (1), and CC22 (1), and one singleton. High clonal diversity was observed among MSSP, and 14 STs (10 of them new) were detected. Twelve (50%) MSSA and 12 (75%) MSSP isolates showed resistance to at least one of the tested antimicrobials, with low MSSA penicillin resistance (5 isolates) and high MSSP tetracycline resistance (9 isolates). MSSA isolates ST398, ST133, ST1 and ST2329[new] were susceptible to all antimicrobials and were the only ones lacking the scn, chp and/or sak IEC genes. High diversity of enterotoxin genes was detected among non-ST398/ST133 MSSA isolates. MSSP showed a more homogeneous virulence genes profile. Our results give evidence that dogs can be S. aureus carriers of not only typical human associated lineages but also lineages commonly detected among other animal species. Continue surveillance on CoPS in dogs is required to unveil their role in the dissemination of clones adapted to other animal species.
TI  - Reductive evolution and the loss of PDC/PAS domains from the genus Staphylococcus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain represents a ubiquitous structural fold that is involved in bacterial sensing and adaptation systems, including several virulence related functions. Although PAS domains and the subclass of PhoQ-DcuS-CitA (PDC) domains have a common structure, there is limited amino acid sequence similarity. To gain greater insight into the evolution of PDC/PAS domains present in the bacterial kingdom and staphylococci in specific, the PDC/PAS domains from the genomic sequences of 48 bacteria, representing 5 phyla, were identified using the sensitive search method based on HMM-to-HMM comparisons (HHblits). RESULTS: A total of 1,007 PAS domains and 686 PDC domains distributed over 1,174 proteins were identified. For 28 Gram-positive bacteria, the distribution, organization, and molecular evolution of PDC/PAS domains were analyzed in greater detail, with a special emphasis on the genus Staphylococcus. Compared to other bacteria the staphylococci have relatively fewer proteins (6-9) containing PDC/PAS domains. As a general rule, the staphylococcal genomes examined in this study contain a core group of seven PDC/PAS domain-containing proteins consisting of WalK, SrrB, PhoR, ArlS, HssS, NreB, and GdpP. The exceptions to this rule are: 1) S. saprophyticus lacks the core NreB protein; 2) S. carnosus has two additional PAS domain containing proteins; 3) S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and S. pseudintermedius have an additional protein with two PDC domains that is predicted to code for a sensor histidine kinase; 4) S. lugdunensis has an additional PDC containing protein predicted to be a sensor histidine kinase. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that variation in PDC/PAS domains among bacteria has limited correlations to the genome size or pathogenicity; however, our analysis established that bacteria having a motile phase in their life cycle have significantly more PDC/PAS-containing proteins. In addition, our analysis revealed a tremendous amount of variation in the number of PDC/PAS-containing proteins within genera. This variation extended to the Staphylococcus genus, which had between 6 and 9 PDC/PAS proteins and some of these appear to be previously undescribed signaling proteins. This latter point is important because most staphylococcal proteins that contain PDC/PAS domains regulate virulence factor synthesis or antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Clonal dynamics of nasal Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in dog-owning household members. Detection of MSSA ST(398).
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of nasal carriage by  Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (SP) among healthy dog-owning household members involved in 7 previous index cases of suspected anthropozoonotic (n = 4) and zoonotic (n = 3) interspecies transmission [4 direct cases, identical SA (n = 3) or SP (n = 1) in owner and dog; three indirect, SP in owner (n = 2) or SA in dog (n = 1)]. Co-carriage with methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) was also evaluated. Sixteen owners and 10 dogs were sampled once every three months for one year. In total, 50 SA and 31 SP were analysed by MLST, and SA also by spa typing. All isolates were subjected to ApaI/SmaI-PFGE and antimicrobial resistance and virulence profiles were determined. All index owners were persistent SA carriers in all direct-anthropozoonotic transmission cases, while only one dog was persistent SA carrier. Owner and dog exhibited a persistent SP carriage status in the direct-zoonotic transmission case. SP was maintained in the index human over time in one indirect-zoonotic transmission case. Only one SP was methicillin-resistant. SA belonged to genetic backgrounds of MRSA pandemic clones: CC45, CC121, CC30, CC5 and CC398. Three individuals carried a MSSA t1451-ST398 clone with the erm(T)-cadD/cadX resistance genes. SA or SP were persistently detected in the nasal cavity of 7 (43.8%) and 2 (12.5%) owners, and in one and 2 dogs, respectively. SA was recovered as the single species in 10 owners and in one dog; SP in 3 owners and 4 dogs; and both bacterial species in one owner and 4 dogs. Co-carriage of SA or SP with MRCoNS isolates was common (30.7%). This is the first study on the dynamics of nasal carriage of SA and SP in healthy pet-owning household members. Dog-contact may play a role in the staphylococcal species distribution of in-contact individuals.
TI  - Molecular Characterization of the Multiple Interactions of SpsD, a Surface Protein from with Host Extracellular Matrix Proteins.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, a commensal and pathogen of dogs and occasionally of humans, expresses surface proteins potentially involved in host colonization and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of SpsD, a surface protein of S. pseudintermedius reported as interacting with extracellular matrix proteins and corneocytes. A ligand screen and Western immunoblotting revealed that the N-terminal A domain of SpsD bound fibrinogen, fibronectin, elastin and cytokeratin 10. SpsD also interfered with thrombin-induced fibrinogen coagulation and blocked ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The binding site for SpsD was mapped to residues 395-411 in the fibrinogen gamma-chain, while binding sites in fibronectin were localized to the N- and C-terminal regions. SpsD also bound to glycine- and serine-rich omega loops within the C-terminal tail region of cytokeratin 10. Ligand binding studies using SpsD variants lacking the C-terminal segment or containing an amino-acid substitution in the putative ligand binding site provided insights into interaction mechanism of SpsD with the different ligands. Together these data demonstrate the multi-ligand binding properties of SpsD and illustrate some interesting differences in the variety of ligands bound by SpsD and related proteins from S. aureus.
TI  - Detection of mecC-positive Staphylococcus aureus (CC130-MRSA-XI) in diseased European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) in Sweden.
AB  - Recently, a novel mec gene conferring beta-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus has been discovered. This gene, mecC, is situated on a SCCmec XI element that has to date been identified in clonal complexes 49, 130, 425, 599 and 1943. Some of the currently known isolates have been identified from animals. This, and observations of mecA alleles that do not confer beta-lactam resistance, indicate that mec genes might have a reservoir in Staphylococcus species from animals. Thus it is important also to screen wildlife isolates for mec genes. Here, we describe mecC-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ST130-MRSA-XI) and the lesions related to the infection in two diseased free-ranging European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). One was found dead in 2003 in central Sweden, and suffered from S. aureus septicaemia. The other one, found on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea in 2011, showed a severe dermatitis and was euthanised. ST130-MRSA-XI isolates were isolated from lesions from both hedgehogs and were essentially identical to previously described isolates from humans. Both isolates carried the complete SCCmec XI element. They lacked the lukF-PV/lukS-PV and lukM/lukF-P83 genes, but harboured a gene for an exfoliative toxin homologue previously described from Staphylococcus hyicus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and other S. aureus of the CC130 lineage. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first reported cases of CC130-MRSA-XI in hedgehogs. Given that one of the samples was taken as early as 2003, this was the earliest detection of this strain and of mecC in Sweden. This and several other recent observations suggest that CC130 might be a zoonotic lineage of S. aureus and that SCCmec XI/mecC may have originated from animal pathogens.
TI  - First detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ST398 and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius ST68 from hospitalized equines in Spain.
AB  - Eight coagulase-positive staphylococci from equines with different pathologies obtained between 2005 and 2011 were investigated. Isolates were characterized by different molecular techniques (spa-, agr-, MLST), and clonal relatedness of strains was investigated by ApaI and SmaI PFGE. Anti-microbial resistance and virulence profiles were determined. Six isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus, and two as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Of these, four isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ST398 and one S. pseudintermedius was mecA positive and typed as ST68. One MRSA ST398 strain was isolated in 2005 and might be one of the earliest MRSA ST398 descriptions in Spain. All 5 mecA-positive strains were multidrug resistant and were isolated from hospitalized equines. Three MRSA ST398 strains carried the recently described transposon Tn559 within the chromosomal radC gene. The mecA-positive S. pseudintermedius ST68 strain was also multidrug resistant and harboured the erm(B)-Tn5405-like element. This ST68 strain presented a clear susceptible phenotype to oxacillin and cefoxitin regardless of the presence of an integral and conserved mecA gene and mecA promoter, which enhances the need for testing the presence of this gene in routine analysis to avoid treatment failures. These data reflect the extended anti-microbial resistance gene acquisition capacities of both bacterial species and evidence their pathogenic properties. The first detection of MRSA ST398 and S. pseudintermedius ST68 in horses in Spain is reported.
TI  - Multi-drug and methicillin resistance of staphylococci from canine patients at a  veterinary teaching hospital (2006-2011).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past 10 years, an increase in methicillin and multi-drug resistant staphylococcal species has been identified worldwide and anecdotally reported within our veterinary teaching hospital. OBJECTIVE: To determine the methicillin resistance (MR) and multi-drug resistance (MDR) patterns of staphylococcal species isolated from canine patients between 2006 and 2011. ANIMALS AND METHODS: Staphylococcal isolates (n = 1069) were cultured from the canine patient population of the veterinary teaching hospital. The susceptibility reports of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, S. aureus, S. schleiferi v. coagulans, S. schleiferi v. schleiferi, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were assessed. Isolates were organized into five site categories. Isolates were scored on a 0-10 scale based on resistance to antimicrobial classes, with MDR classified as an isolate scoring a value >/=3. Statistical analysis included chi(2), Fisher's exact test, and ANOVA with mean square and post hoc analysis; p < 0.05 was significant. RESULTS: S. pseudintermedius (76.6%), S. aureus (15.5%), S. schleiferi v. coagulans (5.7%), S. schleiferi v. schleiferi (1.2%), and CoNS (0.9%) isolation was observed. MR occurred in 11.4% of all combined isolates, with no difference between sites and years. Of the S. pseudintermedius isolates, 4.5% were methicillin resistant. Of all the isolates, 27.5% were MDR. The mean resistance score of S. pseudintermedius isolates increased significantly comparing 2006 and 2008 (p = 0.0006) and 2006 and 2009 (p = 0.0009). The mean score of all combined isolates increased significantly comparing 2006 and 2008 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: MR staphylococci isolation is similar when compared to other studies. However, increased MDR isolation is of greater concern and high-scoring MDR staphylococci will limit our future antimicrobial choices.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal contamination of clothing worn by personnel  in a veterinary teaching hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) contamination rate of white coats (WC) and surgical scrubs (SS) worn by personnel at the Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Centre (OVCHSC) and to identify risk factors associated with clothing contamination. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE POPULATION: Personnel including clinical faculty, house officers, technicians, and veterinary students working at the OVCHSC. METHODS: Electrostatic cloths were used to sample WC and SS of hospital personnel. Samples were tested for MRSA and MRSP and isolates were typed. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and data was evaluated for risk factors. RESULTS: Of 114 specimens, MRS were isolated from 20 (17.5%), MRSA from 4 (3.5%), and MRSP from 16 (14.0%). Technicians were 9.5x (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 1.2-infinity, P = .03) more likely than students to have clothing contaminated with MRSA. No risk factors were identified for MRSP or for overall MRS contamination. CONCLUSIONS: Standard hospital clothing was found to have a high prevalence of MRS contamination in a veterinary teaching hospital and could be a source of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - A comparative evaluation of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from harness racing-horses, breeding mares and riding-horses in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) which is a potencial risk factor of transmission between animals and humans in different types of horses (harness racing-horses, breeding mares and riding-horses) and to compare the antimicrobial resistance of the isolates. METHODS: A total of 191 healthy horses, housed at different locations of the Campania Region (Italy), were included in the study. Nasal swab samples were collected from each nostril of the horses. The mecA gene was detected by a nested PCR technique. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested for each isolate. RESULTS: MRS was isolated from nasal samples of 68/191 (35.6%; 95% CI: 28.9%-42.9%) healthy horses. All isolates were coagulase-negative with the exception of two coagulase-positive MRS strains, identified as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, 2/83 (2.4%; 95% CI: 0.4%-9.2%). Interestingly, both coagulase-positive MRS isolates were from harness racing-horses. These horses also presented a significantly higher positivity for MRS (53.3%; 95% CI: 40.1%-66.1%) than the breeding mares and riding-horses groups. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed difference between isolates due to different origins except for an almost common high resistance to aminopenicillins, such as ampicillin and amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that harness racing-horses may act as a significant reservoir of MRS as compared to breeding mares and riding-horses.
TI  - Duplex real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from dairy cow milk.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus isolates from dairy cow mastitis are not always consistent  with the characteristic morphology described, and molecular investigation is often needed. The aim of the study was to develop a duplex real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of Staph. aureus isolates, targeting both nuc and Sa442. Overall, 140 isolates collected from dairy cow mastitis in 90 different herds, were tested. All strains had been identified using morphological and biochemical characteristics. DNA from each strain was amplified in real-time PCR assay, to detect nuc or Sa442. Thereafter, a duplex real-time PCR assay was performed, and specificity of the amplified products was assessed by high resolution melting curve analysis. Out of 124 Staph. aureus isolates, 33 did not show the typical morphology or enzymic activity; in 118 strains, the two melt-curve peaks consistent with nuc and Sa442 were revealed, while 2 isolates showed only the peak consistent with Sa442. Four isolates bacteriologically identified as Staph. aureus, were PCR-negative and were further identified as Staph. pseudintermedius by sequencing. Staph. pseudintermedius and coagulase-negative staphylococci did not carry nuc or Sa442. The results showed the correct identification of all isolates, comprehending also coagulase-or nuc-negative Staph. aureus, while other coagulase-positive Staphylococci were correctly identified as non-Staph. aureus. Both sensitivity and specificity were 100%. High resolution melting analysis allowed easy detection of unspecific products. Finally, the duplex real-time PCR was applied directly to 40 milk samples, to detect infected mammary quarters. The assay confirmed the results of bacteriological analysis, on Staph. aureus-positive or-negative samples. Therefore, the proposed duplex real-time PCR could be used in laboratory routine as a cost-effective and powerful tool for high-throughput identification of atypical Staph. aureus isolates causing dairy cow mastitis. Also, it could be applied directly to milk samples, to detect Staph. aureus mammary infections avoiding bacteriological analysis.
TI  - Phage type 187 as a separate subunit MboI restriction site within the Staphylococcus aureus species.
AB  - The aim of this study was to use MboI restriction of pta gene fragment to compare the strains of Staphylococcus aureus phage type 187 and other phage types of S. aureus isolated from humans and dogs, as well as canine S. intermedius group strains. The study included 395 human and canine staphylococcal strains representing S. aureus, S. intermedius, and S. pseudintermedius species. The strains were identified with classic phenotypic methods and by the presence of species-specific thermostable nuclease (nuc SA) gene. All the strains were subjected to the analysis of MboI restriction site of pta gene fragment with PCR-RFLP method. Nearly, all human and animal strains of S. aureus possessed 156- and 164-bp restriction fragments. One of the human strains lacked the 320-bp amplification product. In the case of all S. aureus phage type 187, the amplification product of pta gene was insusceptible to cutting with MboI restrictase. None of S. intermedius strains possessed restriction sites present in the product of amplification of pta gene, while all the strains of S. pseudintermedius had 213- and 107-bp restriction fragments. In conclusion, our findings regarding S. aureus phage type 187 reveal that within the population of strains of S. aureus species, these bacteria represent a group with distinct properties.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococci: implications for our food supply?
AB  - Food-borne intoxication, caused by heat-stable enterotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, causes over 240,000 cases of food-borne illness in the United States annually. Other staphylococci commonly associated with animals may also produce these enterotoxins. Foods may be contaminated by infected food handlers during slaughter and processing of livestock or by cross-contamination during food preparation. S. aureus also causes a variety of mild to severe skin and soft tissue infections in humans and other animals. Antibiotic resistance is common in staphylococci. Hospital-associated (HA) S. aureus are resistant to numerous antibiotics, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) presenting significant challenges in health care facilities for over 40 years. During the mid-1990s new human MRSA strains developed outside of hospitals and were termed community-associated (CA). A few years later, MRSA was isolated from horses and methicillin resistance was detected in Staphylococcus intermedius/pseudintermedius from dogs and cats. In 2003, a livestock-associated (LA) MRSA strain was first detected in swine. These methicillin-resistant staphylococci pose additional food safety and occupational health concerns. MRSA has been detected in a small percentage of retail meat and raw milk samples indicating a potential risk for food-borne transmission of MRSA. Persons working with animals or handling meat products may be at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant infections. This review discusses the scope of the problem of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and some strategies for control of these bacteria and prevention of illness.
TI  - Efficacy of clarithromycin on biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) caused by biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have emerged as the most common hospital-acquired infections in companion animals. No methods currently exist for the therapeutic remediation of SSIs caused by MRSP in biofilms. Clarithromycin (CLA) has been shown to prevent biofilm formation by Staphylococcus aureus. This study aims to assess the in vitro activity of CLA in eradicating MRSP biofilm formation on various materials. RESULTS: Quantitative assay results (P = 0.5126) suggest that CLA does not eradicate MRSP biofilm formation on polystyrene after 4 - 24 h growth periods. Scanning electron micrographs confirmed that CLA did not eradicate MRSP biofilm formed on orthopaedic implants. CONCLUSIONS: By determining the in vitro characteristics and activities of MRSP isolates alone and against antibiotics, in vitro models of biofilm related infections can be made. In vitro data suggests that CLA does not effectively eradicate S. pseudintermedius biofilms in therapeutic doses.
TI  - High diversity of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius lineages and toxigenic traits in healthy pet-owning household members. Underestimating normal household contact?
AB  - Forty-three unrelated pet-owning households were screened in Spain to study the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius nasal carriage, their genetic lineages and virulence traits. Sixty-seven healthy owners and 66 healthy pets were investigated. Isolates characterization was performed and potential interspecies transmission was assessed. S. aureus was present in 51.2% of households studied while S. pseudintermedius in 30.2%. Twenty-eight owners (41.8%) carried S. aureus: one methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) [t5173-ST8-SCCmecIVa] and 27 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Three owners (4.5%) were colonized by methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP). Fifteen pets (22.7%) carried S. pseudintermedius: two methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) [ST71-SCCmecII/III; ST92-SCCmecV] and 13 MSSP; in addition, 8 pets (12.1%) presented MSSA. High diversity of spa and sequence types (STs) was detected. Typical livestock-associated S. aureus lineages (CC398, CC9) were observed in humans and/or companion animals and hospital and/or community-acquired S. aureus lineages (CC45, CC121, CC5, CC8) were detected among pets. Almost 40% of S. pseudintermedius were multidrug-resistant. S. aureus isolates harboured a remarkable high number of virulence genes. The expA gene was detected in 3 S. pseudintermedius isolates. Identical strains from both owners and their pets were identified in 5 households (11.6%): (a) four MSSA (t073-ST45/CC45, t159-ST121/CC121, t209-ST109/CC9, t021-ST1654([new])/singleton) and (b) one multidrug-resistant MSSP (ST142([new])). Highly clonally diverse and toxigenic S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius are common colonizers of healthy humans and pets. The presence of these bacterial species, virulence genes, and interspecies transmission detected, points out to consider pet ownership as a risk factor to acquire, maintain and spread, potential pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Staphylococci isolated from carriage sites and infected sites of dogs as a reservoir of multidrug resistance and methicillin resistance.
AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and  methicillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci in healthy dogs and in dogs with evident symptoms of infection. The samples from 172 healthy and 197 infected dogs were examined. The staphylococci were identified with conventional methods and by means of the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method (MboI). Susceptibility to 15 antibiotics from 10 different antimicrobial classes was tested. Resistance to methicillin was confirmed by the presence of Staphylococcus aureus mecA and S. sciuri mecA genes. Multidrug resistance was defined as resistance to three or more antimicrobial classes. The oral mucosa to be the most frequent site of staphylococcal colonization (55.8 %), followed by nasal cavity (44.2 %), and anus (32.6 %). The prevalence of MDR staphylococci in infected dogs was significantly higher than in the healthy animals (74/137 vs. 34/95, P = 0.006). The MR strains of S. pseudintermedius (2.9 %) originated solely from infected dogs. In contrast, the MR coagulase-negative strains (7.4 %) were isolated solely from healthy dogs. S. aureus strains originated from nasal swabs, MRSA strains were not isolated. MDR staphylococci and MR S. pseudintermedius are more common among infected dogs, but coagulase-negative staphylococci (mostly S. sciuri) seem to be a reservoir of methicillin resistance in healthy dogs.
TI  - Susceptibility of canine and feline bacterial pathogens to pradofloxacin and comparison with other fluoroquinolones approved for companion animals.
AB  - In this study, 908 bacterial pathogens from defined infections of dogs and cats were tested for their susceptibility to the novel fluoroquinolone pradofloxacin, which was approved in 2011 for use in cats and dogs. Most of the bacteria tested (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Escherichia coli, beta-haemolytic streptococci, Pasteurella multocida and Bordetella bronchiseptica) exhibited low pradofloxacin MIC(90) values of </= 0.25 mug/ml. Solely Proteus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa had higher MIC(90) values of >/= 4 mug/ml. Only six (3.4%) of 177 S. pseudintermedius and 12 (5.3%) of 227 E. coli isolates showed pradofloxacin MICs of >/= 2 mug/ml. Analysis of the quinolone resistance determining regions of the target genes identified double mutations in GyrA that resulted in amino acid exchanges S83L+D87N or S83L+D87Y and single or double mutations in ParC that resulted in amino acid exchanges S80I or S80I+E84G in all 12 E. coli isolates. The six S. pseudintermedius isolates exhibited amino acid exchanges S84L or E88K in GyrA and S80I in GrlA. Comparative analysis of the MICs of pradofloxacin and the MICs determined for enrofloxacin and its main metabolite ciprofloxacin, but also marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, difloxacin and ibafloxacin was conducted for the target pathogens S. pseudintermedius, E. coli and P. multocida. This comparison confirmed that pradofloxacin MICs were significantly lower than those of the other tested fluoroquinolones.
TI  - Rapid microarray-based identification of different mecA alleles in Staphylococci.
AB  - To screen isolates and to identify mecA alleles, published mecA sequences were analyzed, and a microarray for the rapid discrimination of mecA alleles was designed. A GenBank analysis yielded 135 full-length gene sequences annotated as mecA. These sequences clustered into 32 different alleles corresponding to 28 unique amino acid sequences and to 15 distinct hybridization patterns on this microarray. A collection of 78 clinical and veterinary isolates of Staphylococcus spp. was characterized using this assay. Nine of the 15 expected patterns, as well as one as-yet-unknown pattern, were identified. These patterns were detected in various epidemic methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains, in S. pseudintermedius, and in coagulase-negative species such as S. epidermidis, S. fleurettii, or S. haemolyticus. There was no correlation between the different mecA hybridization patterns and the SCCmec type. Determination of MICs showed that mecA alleles corresponding to only four of these nine patterns were associated with beta-lactam resistance. The mecA alleles that did not confer beta-lactam resistance were largely restricted to coagulase-negative staphylococci of animal origin, such as S. sciuri and S. vitulinus. Because of the diversity of sequences and the different impact on beta-lactam susceptibility, the existence of different mecA alleles needs to be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays for the detection of mecA.
TI  - Case-control study of Staphylococcus lugdunensis infection isolates from small companion animals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus lugdunensis has recently been shown to cause invasive infections of people, which are similar in pathogenic effect to those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Little is known about the pathogenicity of S. lugdunensis in companion animals. OBJECTIVES: To compare potential risk factors for infection, body sites affected, and whether cases and controls had been treated with antimicrobial drugs based upon susceptibility test results. ANIMALS: Thirty-three cases of S. lugdunensis infection (25 dogs, six cats and two small mammals) were identified between January 2003 and August 2011. Two Staphylococcus pseudintermedius controls, which were identified by the microbiology laboratory immediately before and after each S. lugdunensis case, were host-species matched to each case. METHODS: A retrospective case-control analysis. RESULTS: During the period evaluated, the prevalence of S. lugdunensis infection was 1.3 cases per 10,000 hospital admissions for dogs and 0.95 cases per 10,000 admissions for cats (P = 0.453). In univariate analyses, S. pseudintermedius isolation was significantly associated with skin infections (P < 0.0001), while S. lugdunensis isolation was associated with the respiratory tract (P = 0.03) and other deep tissues (P = 0.005). Cases were less likely than controls to have been treated based upon susceptibility test results (P = 0.02). A conditional logistic regression analysis showed isolation of S. lugdunensis to be associated with recent (</= 30 days) steroid administration (odds ratio, 17.72; 95% confidence interval, 2.35-132.82; P = 0.005); and in-patient status (odds ratio, 9.67; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-42.88; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that S. lugdunensis may cause invasive infections in companion animals, which should be treated with antimicrobials based upon susceptibility tests when available.
TI  - In vitro miconazole susceptibility of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and dissemination of meticillin-resistant staphylococci has created significant treatment challenges in veterinary medicine and increased interest in topical therapy for superficial infections. Concern has been expressed regarding the use of some topical antimicrobials in animals because of the potential for emergence of resistance, and additional options are required. Miconazole has limited antibacterial properties that include antistaphylococcal activity. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the in vitro susceptibility of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus aureus to miconazole. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility of 112 meticillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP), 53 meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 37 meticillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) to miconazole was assessed using agar dilution. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range, MIC(50) and MIC(90) for MRSP were 1-8, 2 and 4 mug/mL, respectively. Corresponding results for MRSA were 1-8, 2 and 6 mug/mL, and for MSSP 1-4, 2 and 2 mug/mL. The MIC for MSSP was a significantly lower MIC than that for both MRSP (P = 0.006) and MRSA (P < 0.001), while the MIC for MRSP was significantly lower than that for MRSA (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These in vitro data suggest that miconazole could be a useful therapeutic option for superficial infections caused by meticillin-susceptible and meticillin-resistant staphylococci, but proper clinical investigation is required.
TI  - Evaluation of cefoxitin disk diffusion breakpoint for detection of methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from dogs.
AB  - Cefoxitin disk diffusion susceptibility testing is a recommended screening method for the detection of methicillin resistance in human isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. A retrospective analysis of 1,146 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from dogs was conducted to determine if screening by the cefoxitin disk method can be similarly useful with S. pseudintermedius. The distribution of cefoxitin growth inhibition zone diameters within this collection was bimodal and correlated well with the results of methicillin resistance gene (mecA) detection by polymerase chain reaction. Of the isolates, 5% had discordant results and, when retested, 84% of these were in agreement. While a greater diversity of isolates and interlaboratory comparisons must be tested, the current study suggests that an epidemiological breakpoint (of approximately </= 30 mm = resistant; >/= 31 = susceptible) can be established to predict methicillin resistance in S. pseudintermedius.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius colonization patterns and strain diversity in healthy dogs: a cross-sectional and longitudinal study.
AB  - This is the first large-scale study of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius colonization and diversity in healthy dogs where samples were collected over a long time and strains were identified by PCR according to the current taxonomy of the S. intermedius group and typed by a highly discriminatory method such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A cross-sectional study of nasal, oral, perineal and inguinal carriage in 119 healthy dogs was followed by a longitudinal study where oral and perineal carriage was examined in 16 dogs for 10 times over a period of 1 year. Altogether we collected 762 samples and 285 S. pseudintermedius isolates, 182 of which were typed by PFGE to determine spatial and temporal strain diversity within individual carriers. In the cross-sectional study, S. pseudintermedius was isolated from at least one body site in 82 (69%) of the 119 dogs. The most frequent carriage sites were the perineum (66%) and the mouth (65%) followed by the nose (27%) and the groin (23%). PFGE analysis showed high heterogeneity among the isolates originating from different body sites of the same dog. Fifteen of the 16 dogs sampled longitudinally carried S. pseudintermedius in at least one sampling time, including six dogs that were negative in the cross-sectional study. Our results indicate that S. pseudintermedius carriage in dogs is more frequent and heterogeneous than S. aureus carriage in humans. This observation might reflect the hygienic standards and social behavior of the canine host, which facilitates transmission of this bacterium in the dog population.
TI  - Occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococci in surgically treated dogs and  the environment in a Swedish animal hospital.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether hospitalised dogs treated surgically may become culture positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Surgically treated dogs (n=45) were sampled for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on admission, before and after surgery and at the time of removal of surgical stitches. The hospital environment (n=57), including healthy dogs in the veterinary hospital environment (n=34), were sampled for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Genetic variations among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates were identified through detection of restriction fragment polymorphisms. RESULTS: No dogs developed a wound infection due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. However, there was a significant increase in the number of dogs carrying methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius after hospitalisation compared to admission (P<0.001). No methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from dogs, but was present in the environment. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates were recovered from environmental surfaces and hospitalised animals, but not from healthy dogs. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates representing nine different restriction endonuclease digestion patterns were found, with two of these occurring in both the environment and on dogs. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Dogs may contract methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in association with surgery and hospitalisation. Resistant bacteria may be transmitted between dogs, staff and the environment. Dogs colonised with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius may be a source for hospital- and community-acquired infections.
TI  - Evidence for production of a bacteriocin-like substance by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus from foods.
AB  - This study assessed the production of a bacteriocin-like substance by Staphylococcus pseudintermedius S28, and evaluates its inhibitory effect against isolates of S. aureus from foods. All indicator isolates were sensitive to the substance produced from S. pseudintermedius S28, showing growth inhibition zones ranging from 14.2 to 28.3 mm. The inhibitory substance has no effect against the producer strain. The inhibitory substance was affected by proteolytic enzymes, while glycolytic and lipolytic enzymes had no effect, suggesting that the active substance could be considered as a bacteriocin-like substance. From these results, S. pseudintermedius S28 could be an interesting producer of a bacteriocin-like substance capable of strongly inhibiting S. aureus.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal contamination of cellular phones of personnel in a veterinary teaching hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated infections are an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in veterinary patients. With the emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, these infections can be particularly difficult to eradicate. Sources of hospital-associated infections can include the patients own flora, medical staff and inanimate hospital objects. Cellular phones are becoming an invaluable feature of communication within hospitals, and since they are frequently handled by healthcare personnel, there may be a potential for contamination with various pathogens. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of contamination of cellular phones (hospital issued and personal) carried by personnel at the Ontario Veterinary College Health Sciences Centre with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). RESULTS: MRSP was isolated from 1.6% (2/123) and MRSA was isolated from 0.8% (1/123) of cellular phones. Only 21.9% (27/123) of participants in the study indicated that they routinely cleaned their cellular phone. CONCLUSIONS: Cellular phones in a veterinary teaching hospital can harbour MRSP and MRSA, two opportunistic pathogens of significant concern. While the contamination rate was low, cellular phones could represent a potential source for infection of patients as well as infection of veterinary personnel and other people that might have contact with them. Regardless of the low incidence of contamination of cellular phones found in this study, a disinfection protocol for hospital-issued and personal cellular phones used in veterinary teaching hospitals should be in place to reduce the potential of cross-contamination.
TI  - Sharing more than friendship--nasal colonization with coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) and co-habitation aspects of dogs and their owners.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the relationship between dogs and their owners has changed, and dogs moved from being working dogs to family members in post-industrial countries, we hypothesized that zoonotic transmission of opportunistic pathogens like coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) is likely between dogs and their owners. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CPS- nasal carriage, different aspects of human-to-dog relationship as well as potential interspecies transmission risk factors were investigated by offering nasal swabs and a questionnaire to dog owners (108) and their dogs (108) at a dog show in 2009. S. aureus was found in swabs of 20 (18.5%) humans and two dogs (1.8%), and spa types which correspond to well known human S. aureus lineages dominated (e.g. CC45, CC30 and CC22). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of the two canine strains revealed ST72 and ST2065 (single locus variant of ST34). Fifteen dogs (13.9%) and six owners (5.6%) harboured S. pseudintermedius, including one mecA-positive human isolate (MRSP). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) revealed that one dog/owner pair harboured indistinguishable S. pseudintermedius- isolates of ST33. Ten (48%) of the 21 S. pseudintermedius-isolates showed resistance towards more than one antimicrobial class. 88.9% of the dog owners reported to allow at least one dog into the house, 68.5% allow the dog(s) to rest on the sofa, 39.8% allow their dogs to come onto the bed, 93.5% let them lick their hands and 52.8% let them lick their face. Bivariate analysis of putative risk factors revealed that dog owners who keep more than two dogs have a significantly higher chance of being colonized with S. pseudintermedius than those who keep 1-2 dogs (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS: In conclusion, CPS transmission between dog owners and their dogs is possible. Further investigation regarding interspecies transmission and the diverse adaptive pathways influencing the epidemiology of CPS (including MRSA and MRSP) in different hosts is needed.
TI  - Genetic and phenotypic characterization of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from veterinary hospitals in South Korea.
AB  - Staphylococci were isolated from veterinary staff, hospitalized animals, and medical equipment from 2 major tertiary veterinary hospitals in South Korea to investigate antimicrobial resistance and genetic relatedness. The detection rate for staphylococci was 55.2% (111/201 samples), and 11 species were identified among the collected staphylococcal strains. The most prevalent species were Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (52/111, 46.8%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (21/111, 18.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (19/111, 17.1%). The methicillin-resistance rates of staphylococci isolated from veterinary staff and medical equipment were higher than those from hospitalized animals. The genotype of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains in the current study was sequence type (ST)72-SCCmec IVc-t324, which is similar to the genotype of prevalent MRSA strains in human beings and food animals in South Korea. Among the mecA-positive S. pseudintermedius isolates, SCCmec V was most prevalent in strains originating from both veterinary staff and hospitalized animals. SCCmec IVa was detected in methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, whereas SCCmec IVc was found in other methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The SCCmec typing, antimicrobial susceptibility tests, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis results showed that methicillin-resistant staphylococci dissemination between hospitalized animals and veterinary staff is possible in South Korean veterinary hospitals.
TI  - The in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against bacterial isolates from  dogs.
AB  - The in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobial agents against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella spp. and Streptococcus canis from dogs was investigated. For Staphylococcus spp., the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin, followed by ampicillin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol. The highest frequency of resistance in E. coli isolates was recorded for tetracycline and streptomycin. Pasteurella spp. and S. canis had the highest resistance rate for tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Most isolates showed full susceptibility to low-level resistance to colistin, florfenicol and fluoroquinolones. Further studies using larger number of isolates from both healthy and diseased dogs would provide a broader picture of antimicrobial resistance at a national level and promote prudent use of antimicrobial agents in companion animals.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in the dog: taxonomy, diagnostics, ecology, epidemiology and pathogenicity.
AB  - The dog is the natural host of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Many research efforts are currently being undertaken to expand our knowledge and understanding of this important canine commensal and opportunistic pathogen. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge of the species, including the latest research outcomes, with emphasis on taxonomy, diagnostics, ecology, epidemiology and pathogenicity. Despite the important taxonomic changes that have occurred over the past few years, the risk of misidentification in canine specimens is low and does not have serious consequences for clinical practice. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius carriage in the dog is more frequent and genetically heterogeneous compared with that of Staphylococcus aureus in man. It appears that these staphylococcal species have evolved separately through adaptation to their respective natural hosts and differ with regard to various aspects concerning ecology, population structure and evolution of antibiotic resistance. Further understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of S. pseudintermedius is hampered by the lack of a standard method for rapid and discriminatory typing and by the limited data available on longitudinal carriage and population structure of meticillin-susceptible strains. With regard to pathogenicity, it is only now that we are starting to explore the virulence potential of S. pseudintermedius based on genomic and proteomic approaches, and more research is needed to assess the importance of individual virulence factors and the possible existence of hypervirulent strains.
TI  - Recovery of staphylococci from computer keyboards in a veterinary medical centre  and the effect of routine cleaning.
AB  - Computers play a vital role in veterinary clinics for grading, examining results, updating records, giving discharge instructions and maintaining billing information. Few studies have documented the degree of contamination or practical methods to disinfect computer equipment within the veterinary clinic setting. The intent of the present study was to characterise the frequency of recovery of Staphylococcus species from computer keyboards from a veterinary teaching hospital setting and to evaluate the effect of daily cleaning. From three keyboards in a treatment area, three in a dermatology area and one in office 70 environmental samples were cultured for Staphylococcus. As an indirect measure to assess cleanliness, samples were collected and tested using the 3M Clean-Trace Luminometer (relative light units [RLU]). Of the 25 Staphylococcus recovered 13 were Staphylococcus species, seven Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, four Staphylococcus aureus and one mixed colony of both Staphylococcus species and S pseudintermedius. The median RLU was 2098 (range 132 to 11,590). Routine cleaning decreased the recovering of Staphylococcus and the RLU values. In summary, the study results demonstrate the value of routine cleaning of keyboards and the need for on-going and regular education of staff and students about good hand hygiene.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of miconazole and polymyxin B against canine meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) infections are increasingly reported in dogs, and these bacteria may be isolated from ear infections. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The main aim of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of miconazole, polymyxin B and a combination of both against 24 canine MRSA and 50 canine MRSP isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 12 other antimicrobial agents were also determined. METHODS: All MIC values were determined according to a broth microdilution assay. RESULTS: Acquired resistance was found to all tested agents, except for linezolid, miconazole and polymyxin B. The MIC values for miconazole and polymyxin B against MRSA were in the range of 4-8 and 8-64 mug/mL, respectively, while the MIC values for miconazole and polymyxin B against MRSP were in the range of 1-2 and 0.25-4 mug/mL, respectively. Using a combination of miconazole and polymyxin B, there was no evidence for enhanced in vitro activity of the combination (i.e. synergy) of both products. Nevertheless, MIC(90) values of the combination of these antimicrobial agents and of a commercial product containing both agents were at least 1000 times lower than the concentration present in the commercial product. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These results indicate that the topical use of a combination of miconazole and polymyxin B in a 43.5:1 ratio may have potential for the treatment of MRSA-mediated and MRSP-associated otitis externa in dogs.
TI  - Prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) from skin and carriage sites of dogs after treatment of their meticillin-resistant or meticillin-sensitive staphylococcal pyoderma.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Meticillin-resistant staphylococci are significant pathogens in veterinary dermatology, yet longitudinal studies of the impact of routine antimicrobial therapy on emergence or resolution of resistance are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of meticillin-resistant staphylococci on skin and carriage sites in dogs with bacterial pyoderma and evaluate the prevalence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) colonization after successful treatment of pyoderma. ANIMALS: One hundred and seventy-three dogs that presented to a dermatology referral service with pyoderma and 41 healthy control dogs. METHODS: Skin, nasal and rectal swabs for bacterial culture were collected at the time of referral and after clinical resolution of the pyoderma. Meticillin resistance was confirmed by demonstration of penicillin binding protein 2a antigen. RESULTS: Initially, skin cultures yielded MRSP in 70 (40.5%) dogs, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in three (1.7%) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus schleiferi ssp. coagulans (MRSScoag) in five (2.9%). Samples collected from the nose and rectum (carriage sites) yielded MRSP in 59 (34.1%) dogs, MRSA in 11 (6.4%) and MRSScoag in seven (4.0%). One hundred and two dogs were available for follow-up cultures after clinical cure. Of 42 dogs initially diagnosed with MRSP pyoderma, MRSP was isolated at follow-up from skin in 19 (45.2%) and carriage sites in 20 (47.6%). Of 60 dogs that did not have MRSP pyoderma initially, MRSP was isolated post-treatment from the skin in 17 (28.3%), and MRSP from carriage sites increased from 7.8% (initially) to 26.7% (P = 0.0022). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Colonization by MRSP often persists after resolution of MRSP pyoderma. Acquisition of MRSP during treatment appears to be common.
TI  - Selection of antibiotics for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius: time to revisit some old drugs?
AB  - The aim of this review is to consider systemic therapy options for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). Infections caused by MRSP in small animals--particularly dogs--have been frustrating veterinarians in recent years. After a susceptibility test is performed, veterinarians are left to select from drugs that have not been frequently encountered on a susceptibility report. Some of these are old drugs that have not been used regularly by veterinary dermatologists. As MRSP is, by definition, resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, penicillins and amoxicillin-clavulanate combinations, the beta-lactam drugs are not an option for systemic treatment. As most MRSPs are multidrug resistant, familiar drugs, such as trimethoprim-sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, macrolides and lincosamides (clindamycin), are also not usually an option for treatment. Therefore, veterinarians are left with drugs such as rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and vancomycin to choose from on the basis of an in vitro susceptibility test. Some of these drugs were originally approved over 50 years ago and may not be familiar to some veterinarians. Each of these drugs possesses unique properties and has particular advantages and disadvantages. Veterinarians should be particularly aware of the adverse effects, limitations and precautions when using these drugs. New drugs also have been developed for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in humans. These include linezolid, ceftaroline, daptomycin and tigecycline. Although these drugs are very infrequently--if ever--considered for veterinary use, the properties of these drugs should also be known to veterinary dermatologists.
TI  - Comparative activity of pradofloxacin and marbofloxacin against coagulase-positive staphylococci in a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model based on canine pharmacokinetics.
AB  - Pradofloxacin (PRA), a novel veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone (FQ), is active against Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, the primary cause of canine pyoderma. An in vitro pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model was used to compare the activities of PRA and marbofloxacin (MAR) against three clinical isolates of S. pseudintermedius and reference strain Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Experiments were performed involving populations of 10(10) CFU corresponding to an inoculum density of approximately 5 x 10(7) CFU/mL. The time course of free drug concentrations in canine serum was modelled, resulting from once daily standard oral dosing of 3 mg of PRA/kg and 2 mg of MAR/kg. In addition, experimentally high doses of 6 mg of PRA/kg and 16 mg of MAR/kg were tested against the least susceptible strain. Viable counts were monitored over 24 h. At concentrations associated with standard doses, PRA caused a faster and more sustained killing than MAR of all strains. The ratios of free drug under the concentration-time curve for 24 h over MIC and the maximum concentration of free drug over MIC were at least 90 and 26, and 8.5 and 2.1 for PRA and MAR, respectively. At experimentally high doses, PRA was superior to MAR in terms of immediate killing. Subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to either FQ did not emerge. We conclude that PRA is likely to be an efficacious therapy of canine staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Comparative genomic analysis of the genus Staphylococcus including Staphylococcus aureus and its newly described sister species Staphylococcus simiae.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Staphylococcus belongs to the Gram-positive low G + C content group of the Firmicutes division of bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human and veterinary pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of diseases, and has developed important multidrug resistant forms such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus simiae was isolated from South American squirrel monkeys in 2000, and is a coagulase-negative bacterium, closely related, and possibly the sister group, to S. aureus. Comparative genomic analyses of closely related bacteria with different phenotypes can provide information relevant to understanding adaptation to host environment and mechanisms of pathogenicity. RESULTS: We determined a Roche/454 draft genome sequence for S. simiae and included it in comparative genomic analyses with 11 other Staphylococcus species including S. aureus. A genome based phylogeny of the genus confirms that S. simiae is the sister group to S. aureus and indicates that the most basal Staphylococcus lineage is Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, followed by Staphylococcus carnosus. Given the primary niche of these two latter taxa, compared to the other species in the genus, this phylogeny suggests that human adaptation evolved after the split of S. carnosus. The two coagulase-positive species (S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius) are not phylogenetically closest but share many virulence factors exclusively, suggesting that these genes were acquired by horizontal transfer. Enrichment in genes related to mobile elements such as prophage in S. aureus relative to S. simiae suggests that pathogenesis in the S. aureus group has developed by gene gain through horizontal transfer, after the split of S. aureus and S. simiae from their common ancestor. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative genomic analyses across 12 Staphylococcus species provide hypotheses about lineages in which human adaptation has taken place and contributions of horizontal transfer in pathogenesis.
TI  - Insertion sequence IS256 in canine pyoderma isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius associated with antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is the most frequent staphylococcal species isolated from canine pyoderma. The control of S. pseudintermedius infection is often difficult due to the expanded antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. Antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal pathogens is often associated to mobile genetic elements such as the insertion sequence IS256 that was first described as a part of the transposon Tn4001, which confers aminoglycoside resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and in Staphylococcus epidermidis. In this study a collection of 70 S. pseudintermedius isolates from canine pyoderma was used to investigate antimicrobial susceptibility to 15 antibiotics and the presence of IS256, not revealed in S. pseudintermedius yet. Antibiotic resistance profiling demonstrated that all S. pseudintermedius isolates had a multi-drug resistance phenotype, exhibiting simultaneous resistance to at least five antibiotics; indeed methicillin resistant S. pseudintermedius isolates were simultaneously resistant to at least nine antibiotics and all were also gentamicin resistant. PCR analyses revealed the presence of IS256 in 43/70 S. pseudintemedius isolates. The association between the presence of IS256 and the resistance was particularly significant for certain antibiotics: cefovecin, amikacin, gentamicin and oxacillin (chi(2)p-value<0.05). However, there was a striking result in frequency of strains resistant to gentamicin and oxacillin, suggesting a specific association between the presence of the IS256 element and the determinants for the resistance to these antibiotics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the detection of IS256 in S. pseudintermedius isolates and its association with antibiotic resistance. Our findings suggest that S. pseudintermedius may acquire antibiotic resistance genes through mobile genetic elements which may play a predominant role in the dissemination of multi-drug resistance.
TI  - Distribution of SCCmec-associated phenol-soluble modulin in staphylococci.
AB  - The recently described phenol-soluble modulin PSM-mec was detected in Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus fleuretti, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus simulans and Staphylococcus vitulinus from different hosts (humans, goats, dogs, cats, pigs, cattle and turkeys). It was identified in isolates harbouring SCCmec types II, IIA, IIB, IID, III, VIII and in some irregular or truncated elements.
TI  - What's happened to Staphylococcus intermedius? Taxonomic revision and emergence of multi-drug resistance.
AB  - Staphylococcus intermedius has been the predominant coagulase-positive Staphylococcus isolated from canine skin and mucosae and the most commonly reported staphylococcal pathogen in small animal practice for the last 35 years. Although microbiological tests have historically indicated variability in biochemical characteristics amongst S. intermedius isolates from animals, an acceptable level of diagnostic accuracy for clinical purposes was readily achievable with routine phenotypic testing. However, three recent developments have changed our understanding of the term "S. intermedius" and have challenged veterinary bacteriologists to ensure correct species identification of pathogenic staphylococci from small animals. First, the increasing recognition of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in small animal practice and its human health implications demand accurate species identification. Secondly, the application of molecular techniques to analysis of staphylococcal isolates has led to a revised taxonomy and canine isolates of S. intermedius being re-named S. pseudintermedius. Thirdly, the recent, rapid emergence of meticillin- and multi-drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) has become a major therapeutic challenge in veterinary practice worldwide, including the UK. This article discusses the background of the recent taxonomic changes within the genus Staphylococcus and reviews the key features of MRSP and its implications for day-to-day laboratory diagnosis and small animal practice.
TI  - Bactericidal properties of pradofloxacin against veterinary pathogens.
AB  - Pradofloxacin is a new veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone developed for use against bacterial infections in dogs and cats involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The minimal bactericidal concentrations have been determined against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus canis, Proteus spp., Fusobacterium spp., Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella species. A subset of these species was selected, and the in vitro rate of kill by pradofloxacin was determined. For 27 of the 30 tested aerobic strains the pradofloxacin MBC was within two doubling dilutions of the MIC. For the remaining strains, the MIC and MBC were within three to four doubling dilutions. Pradofloxacin also demonstrated bactericidal activity against all anaerobic strains, and the MBC was equal to the MIC for four of the strains, within 1 doubling dilution for three strains, within 2 dilutions for a further 3 strains and within 3 dilutions for the remaining five strains. As pradofloxacin concentration was increased, a faster rate of killing was observed; bactericidal effects were seen in all cases at concentrations </= 0.25 mug/mL. The bactericidal activity against the anaerobic strains was marked, of particular relevance was the complete absence of regrowth even at 48 h at concentrations as low as 0.125 mug/mL. In conclusion, pradofloxacin exhibits clear bactericidal activity in terms of MBC and kill kinetics against aerobic and anaerobic clinical isolates from dogs and cats at concentrations that are greatly exceeded within the systemic circulation after administration of the recommended therapeutic doses to the target animals. It is expected that such a rapid rate of kill will play a significant role in clinical efficacy. These data demonstrate the complete and rapid killing of anaerobic bacteria by a veterinary 8-cyano-fluoroquinolone.
TI  - Detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius with commercially available selective media.
AB  - AIMS: Commercially available selective media for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were tested for the detection and isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Five different screening agars [mannitol salt agar with oxacillin and BD BBL Chromagar MRSA (BD Diagnostics); chromID MRSA agar (bioMerieux); Oxacillin resistance screening agar base (ORSAB); and Brilliance MRSA agar (Oxoid)] were analysed for the detection of MRSP. Bacteria that may be isolated together with MRSP and may grow on the screening agars were included in the study to determine possible interference with the growth of MRSP. MRSP grew well on all selective media except on BD BBL Chromagar MRSA (BD Diagnostics) and chromID MRSA agar (bioMerieux), on which a low to moderate growth rate was noted. CONCLUSIONS: ORSAB (Oxoid) and Brilliance MRSA agar (Oxoid) are most suitable for the detection and isolation of MRSP from clinical material. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The importance of MRSP in veterinary medicine is increasing. Diagnostic systems are needed to detect MRSP carrier as soon as possible. This study provides information about selected MRSA screening agars for the detection of MRSP to the clinical microbiologists.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in companion animals: nosocomial infections as one reason for the rising prevalence of these potential zoonotic pathogens in clinical samples.
AB  - The ongoing change in the relationship between humans and companion animals is hallmarked by the increasing intensive care provided to companion animals in veterinary medicine, resulting in growing numbers of high-risk animal patients. The emergence of nosocomial infections in small animal clinics is one of the major drawbacks of this development, especially in terms of multidrug-resistance and potentially zoonotic pathogens. This mini-review therefore addresses recent findings regarding the increasing prevalence of multi-resistant bacterial pathogens like methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS), including Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) as well as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae in companion animals. Along with the steady increase of nosocomial infection rates in veterinary clinics, particular attention has recently been drawn to the genetic background of multi-resistant strains, resulting in the identification of certain genetic lineages which frequently appear in both, human and animal samples. These sequence types (ST), included ST254, ST8 and ST22 in terms of MRSA and ST131, ST405 and ST648 for ESBL-producing E. coli. The interspecies distribution of these STs resulted in the assumption that certain extended-host spectrum genotypes (EHSG) might exist both for MRS and ESBL-producing E. coli. These initial findings underline the necessity to investigate the major molecular or functional driving forces facilitating interspecies transferability of such EHSG strains. Due to the zoonotic potential of these multi-resistant bacteria, another aspect of the changing social role of companion animals needs to be addressed: the close contact of pets with their owners, resulting in presumptive new transmission and infection routes. We therefore envision retaliatory actions like initial surveillance and monitoring programs not only in livestock, but also particularly in companion animals. Interdisciplinary approaches including human and veterinary experts should be implemented to develop reliable investigation procedures with respect to the current reality of animal owners and their pets. Additionally, consequent basic hygienic measures, prudent use of antimicrobials in companion animals and efforts regarding implementation of antibiotic stewardships should be fostered.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of gallium maltolate against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius: An in vitro study.
AB  - Gallium is a trivalent semi-metallic element that has shown antimicrobial activity against several important human pathogens. This antimicrobial activity is likely related to its substitution in important iron-dependent pathways of bacteria. The genus Staphylococcus, which includes human and animal pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality, requires iron for growth and colonization. In this study, gallium maltolate, at various concentrations between 50 and 200muM, inhibited the in vitro growth of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at time-points between 8 and 36h after inoculation. The inhibitory activity of gallium maltolate against clinical isolates of MRSA and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) from a veterinary teaching hospital was determined.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in northern Colorado shelter animals.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have been recognized as significant pathogens in veterinary medicine. There have been documented cases of MRSA infection and colonization in veterinary critical care units, in veterinary personnel, and in equine and feline patients. To date, there have been no studies examining the prevalence of MRSA or MRSP colonization of cats and dogs in animal shelters in the United States. The purpose of the current study was to determine the prevalence of MRSA and MRSP in cats and dogs in a northern Colorado animal shelter. Samples were collected from 200 cats and 200 dogs in an open admission shelter. Each species was divided into 2 smaller groups: 100 dogs or cats housed in the stray ward and 100 dogs or cats housed in the adoption area. Samples were evaluated for the prevalence of MRSA or MRSP, which was verified through aerobic culture and Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion to confirm antimicrobial sensitivity. Results revealed MRSA in 0.5% of cat samples, MRSA in 0.5% of dog samples, and MRSP in 3% of dog samples. These results are consistent with previously published prevalence rates for these 2 organisms in non-shelter populations of dogs and cats, indicating that cats and dogs from this Colorado shelter do not appear to pose any greater risk to the public than do cats and dogs in the general pet population.
TI  - Determination of staphylococcal exotoxins, SCCmec types, and genetic relatedness  of Staphylococcus intermedius group isolates from veterinary staff, companion animals, and hospital environments in Korea.
AB  - The Staphylococcus (S.) intermedius group (SIG) has been a main research subject  in recent years. S. pseudintermedius causes pyoderma and otitis in companion animals as well as foodborne diseases. To prevent SIG-associated infection and disease outbreaks, identification of both staphylococcal exotoxins and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) types among SIG isolates may be helpful. In this study, it was found that a single isolate (one out of 178 SIG isolates examined) harbored the canine enterotoxin SEC gene. However, the S. intermedius exfoliative toxin gene was found in 166 SIG isolates although the S. aureus-derived exfoliative toxin genes, such as eta, etb and etd, were not detected. SCCmec typing resulted in classifying one isolate as SCCmec type IV, 41 isolates as type V (including three S. intermedius isolates), and 10 isolates as non-classifiable. Genetic relatedness of all S. pseudintermedius isolates recovered from veterinary staff, companion animals, and hospital environments was determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Strains having the same band patterns were detected in S. pseudintermedius isolates collected at 13 and 18 months, suggesting possible colonization and/or expansion of a specific S. pseudintermedius strain in a veterinary hospital.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strains isolated from clinical samples of animal origin.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the species distribution among 44 randomly selected clinical isolates (30 mecA-positive and 14 mecA-negative) of animal origin previously identified as Staphylococcus intermedius by phenotypic tests and species-specific PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. For this purpose, we used a multiplex PCR for the detection of the nuc gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pta gene amplified by PCR. Both methods allow discrimination of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius from the other closely related members of the S. intermedius group and other coagulase-positive staphylococci isolated from animals. Genetic diversity of S. pseudintermedius strains was analyzed by staphylococcal protein A-encoding gene (spa) typing. Multiplex PCR method was used to identify staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type in mecA-positive strains. All isolates previously identified as S. intermedius were shown to belong to S. pseudintermedius. According to PCR-based SCCmec typing, SCCmecIII was the most prevalent type (n = 23), and solely seven isolates were designated as non-typeable. Furthermore, the assessment of spa-typing results revealed that the majority of all strains (n = 27) harbored spa type t02, and 17 strains were classified as non-typeable.
TI  - Carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in small animal veterinarians: indirect evidence of zoonotic transmission.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is increasingly reported in small animals and cases of human infections have already been described despite its recent emergence in veterinary practice. We investigated the prevalence of MRSP and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among small animal dermatologists attending a national veterinary conference in Italy. Nasal swabs were obtained from 128 veterinarians, seven of which harboured MRSP (n = 5; 3.9%) or MRSA (n = 2; 1.6%). A follow-up study of two carriers revealed that MRSP persisted for at least 1 month in the nasal cavity. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) was isolated from 32 (25%) conference participants, whereas methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) was not detected, suggesting that MRSP may have a particular ability to colonize humans compared to MSSP. All isolates were characterized by spa typing. Methicillin-resistant isolates were further typed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, SCCmec and multi-locus sequence typing. Two lineages previously associated with pets were identified among the five MRSP isolates; the European epidemic clone ST71-SCCmec II-III and ST106-SCCmec IV. One of the two MRSA isolates displayed a genotype (ST22- SCCmecIV) frequently reported in dogs and cats. MRSP isolates were resistant to more antimicrobial agents compared with MRSA isolates and displayed the typical multidrug resistance patterns of MRSP in pets. The 32 MSSA isolates belonged to 20 spa types and the most frequent types (t12, t15 and t166) were associated with common S. aureus lineages in humans (CC30 and CC45). Although low, the 3.9% MRSP carriage rate found among small animal dermatologists was surprising in consideration of the rare occurrence of S. pseudintermedius in humans, the lack of MSSP detection and the recent appearance of MRSP in Europe. As cases of human MRSP infection have been linked with pets, veterinarians should be aware of this zoonotic risk and proper preventative measures should be taken to avoid MRSP transmission from animal patients.
TI  - Biochemical markers and protein pattern analysis for canine coagulase-positive staphylococci and their distribution on dog skin.
AB  - Coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS) including S. pseudintermedius, S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans and S. aureus are etiological agents of dermatitis in companion animals and can be zoonotic pathogens. To date no consensual biochemical marker for routine microbiological identification of these species has been identified. The aim of this study was to evaluate biochemical markers and compare the results with the approved molecular method, multiplex-PCR (M-PCR), and confirm their species-specific phenotypic characteristic by using SDS-PAGE. The distribution and frequency of CoPS species were also determined. Three hundred and thirty-seven canine CoPS isolates were obtained from the nasal mucosa, perineum and groins of 66 healthy dogs and were identified by the M-PCR as S. aureus (n=5), S. pseudintermedius (n=263) and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans (n=69). Selected biochemical tests including the Voges-Proskauer test, mannitol broth fermentation, the assimilation of maltose, galactose, trahalose and lactose using broth medium, were successfully used to distinguish the three species of canine CoPS from other CoPS species. Additionally, species-specific protein patterns were also found to be useful for phenotypic differentiation, with good agreement with the results of M-PCR and the use of biochemical markers. S. aureus occured infrequently on dog skin while co-colonization with S. pseudintermedius and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans was observed. We propose the use of consensual biochemical markers of canine CoPS with the presence of the unique protein patterns as an alternative tool for conventional laboratory use.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from various animals.
AB  - This study characterized the antimicrobial susceptibility of 221 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from various species, and 60 canine Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from 1986 through 2000 at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM). Resistance of S. aureus was most common to penicillin (31%) and tetracycline (14%); resistance of S. pseudintermedius to penicillin was present in 8% and to tetracycline in 34% of isolates. Resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was only seen among S. pseudintermedius, and there was no resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam, cephalothin, amikacin, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, or rifampin among any isolate. Inducible clindamycin resistance was found in both S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius, highlighting the need for careful interpretation of culture and susceptibility test results. There were significant differences in the minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline between avian, bovine, equine, and porcine isolates.
TI  - The role of mecA and blaZ regulatory elements in mecA expression by regional clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - Two major regional clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have been identified in Europe and North America. They are designated multilocus sequence types (ST) 71 and 68 and contain staphylococcal chromosome cassette (SCCmec) types II-III and V(T), respectively. One notable difference between the two clones is a deletion in the mecI/mecR1 regulatory apparatus of ST 68 SCCmec V(T). This deletion in analogous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) results in more responsive and greater expression of the mecA encoded penicillin-binding protein 2a, and is associated with SCCmec types occurring in community-acquired MRSA lineages. The aim of this study was to characterize mec and bla regulatory apparatuses in MRSP and determine their effects on expression of mecA. Seventeen S. pseudintermedius isolates representing nine methicillin-resistant ST lineages were screened for the presence of the repressors blaI and mecI and sensors blaR1 and mecR1. The bla and mec operons for each isolate were sequenced and compared for homology between the repressor open-reading frames (ORF), sensor ORFs, and mecA promoter regions. A real-time reverse transcriptase PCR expression assay was developed, validated and applied to nine isolates determining the effect of oxacillin induction on mecA transcription. Significant differences were found in mecA expression between isolates with a full regulatory complement (mecI/mecR1 and blaI/blaR1) and those with truncated and/or absent regulatory elements. Isolates representative of European and North American MRSP ST regional clones have dissimilar mecA responses to oxacillin.
TI  - Molecular basis of rifampicin resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  pseudintermedius isolates from dogs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) often display resistance to almost all classes of antimicrobial agents used in veterinary medicine. In the present study, we investigated the emergence of rifampicin resistance in MRSP, the persistence of these isolates and identified the corresponding mutations in the rpoB gene. METHODS: In addition to two rifampicin-resistant MRSP isolates from a multicentre study, consecutive MRSP isolates collected prior to and after rifampicin therapy from nine dogs at five Dutch veterinary hospitals were included in this study. The isolates were tested for resistance to rifampicin and other antimicrobial agents. The rifampicin resistance-determining region (RRDR) within the rpoB gene of the rifampicin-resistant and -susceptible isolates was amplified by PCR and sequenced. PFGE served to determine the genetic relationships of the MRSP isolates. RESULTS: Two MRSP isolates of the multicentre study showed mutations at position 513 or 522 in the RRDR of the rpoB gene. In contrast to the rifampicin-susceptible isolates, all rifampicin-resistant MRSP isolates showed mutations at one or two of the amino acid positions 508, 509, 513, 516, 522, 526 and 531. In most strains, a single amino acid exchange was observed. PFGE analysis confirmed that the rifampicin-resistant MRSP isolates were indistinguishable from or closely related to the rifampicin-susceptible isolate obtained from the same dog prior to rifampicin application. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy of MRSP infections with rifampicin results in the rapid emergence of rifampicin resistance and these isolates can persist for months. As a consequence, single therapy with rifampicin is not recommended.
TI  - Complete genome sequence of the veterinary pathogen Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strain HKU10-03, isolated in a case of canine pyoderma.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a member of the coagulase-positive staphylococci and is the commonest cause of canine pyoderma. We report the first genome sequence of S. pseudintermedius, which shows the presence of numerous virulence factors akin to those of the related human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens isolated from environmental sites in companion animal veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario.
AB  - Hospital-based infection control in veterinary medicine is emerging and the role  of the environment in hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in veterinary hospitals is largely unknown. This study was initiated to determine the recovery of Escherichia coli and selected veterinary and zoonotic pathogens from the environments of 101 community veterinary hospitals. The proportion of hospitals with positive environmental swabs were: E. coli--92%, Clostridium difficile--58%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--9%, CMY-2 producing E. coli--9%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius--7%, and Salmonella--2%. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., canine parvovirus, and feline calicivirus were not isolated. Prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolates was low. Important potential veterinary and human pathogens were recovered including Canadian epidemic strains MRSA-2 and MRSA-5, and C. difficile ribotype 027. There is an environmental reservoir of pathogens in veterinary hospitals; therefore, additional studies are required to characterize risk factors associated with HAI in companion animals, including the role of the environment.
TI  - An IgG-binding protein A homolog in Staphylococcus hyicus.
AB  - Shotgun phage display was used to identify a homolog of the IgG-binding protein staphylococcal protein A in Staphylococcus hyicus type strain CCUG 15602/ATCC 11249. This bacterium is the causative agent of exudative epidermitis in pigs and can also cause mastitis in cattle. A protein with similar features as the originally identified protein A in Staphylococcus aureus was described; an YSIRK-type signal peptide, four IgG-binding domains, a putative peptidoglycan-binding domain, and a cell wall anchoring motif (LPXTG) was present. The highest degree of similarity was to a protein A homolog in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. However, typical Xr polypeptide repeats present in the protein A of S. aureus and S. pseudintermedius could not be identified in the protein A of S. hyicus. The presence of the spa gene in ten porcine and eight bovine clinical isolates of S. hyicus was investigated by PCR. In all isolates, the spa gene could be detected but the amplicons were of two sizes. Sequence analysis of four selected PCR amplicons showed that only three IgG-binding domains were present in the protein A of clinical isolates generating a smaller spa fragment. The finding of spa in S. hyicus contributes to an increased understanding of potential virulence factors in this species.
TI  - Characterization of a new SCCmec element in Staphylococcus cohnii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many SCCmec elements of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) could not be typed using multiplex PCR. Such a 'non-typable' SCCmec was encountered in a Staphylococcus cohnii isolate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The SCCmec type of methicillin-resistant S. cohnii clinical isolate WC28 could not be assigned using multiplex PCR. Newly-designed primers were used to amplify ccrA and ccrB genes. The whole SCCmec was obtained by three overlapping long-range PCR, targeting regions from left-hand inverted repeat (IRL) to ccrA/B, from ccrA/B to mecA and from mecA to orfX. The region abutting IRL was identified using inverse PCR with self-ligated enzyme-restricted WC28 fragments as the template. WC28 SCCmec had a class A mec gene complex (mecI-mecR1-mecA). The ccrA and ccrB genes were closest (89.7% identity) to ccrA(SHP) of Staphylococcus haemolyticus strain H9 and to ccrB3 (90% identity) of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius strain KM241, respectively. Two new genes potentially encoding AAA-type ATPase were found in J1 region and a psiTn554 transposon was present in J2 region, while J3 region was the same as many SCCmec of Staphylococcus aureus. WC28 SCCmec abutted an incomplete SCC element with a novel allotype of ccrC, which was closest (82% identity) to ccrC1 allele 9 in Staphylococcus saprophyticus strain ATCC 15305. Only two direct target repeat sequences, one close to the 3'-end of orfX and the other abutting the left end of WC28 SCCmec, could be detected. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A new 35-kb SCCmec was characterized in a S. cohnii isolate, carrying a class A mec gene complex, new variants of ccrA5 and ccrB3 and two novel genes in the J1 region. This element is flanked by 8-bp perfect inverted repeats and is similar to type III SCCmec in S. aureus and a SCCmec in S. pseudintermedius but with different J1 and J3 regions. WC28 SCCmec was arranged in tandem with an additional SCC element with ccrC, SCC(WC28), but the two elements might have integrated independently rather than constituted a composite. This study adds new evidence of the diversity of SCCmec in CoNS and highlights the need for characterizing the 'non-typable' SCCmec to reveal the gene pool associated with mecA.
TI  - Retrospective study of necropsy-associated coagulase-positive staphylococci in horses.
AB  - Coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS) are potential causative agents of equine  infections, but they are rarely responsible for the death of the animal. In the current study, staphylococci implicated in the death or euthanasia of horses were retrospectively studied in 3,457 necropsies performed over a decade (1995-2006). Morbidity associated with CoPS was 1.7%, representing 60 isolates of CoPS, which were identified as Staphylococcus aureus (59) and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (1). Coagulase-positive staphylococci (alone or in association with another bacterial species) were associated with the death or euthanasia of 90% of the cases (54/60). Proportions of antibiotic resistance to penicillin G and tetracycline reached 62.7% and 23.7%, respectively. Virulence genes were detected in 91.7% of the strains, with a majority of seh or sei enterotoxin genes. Finally, 3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates belonging to the t064 spa-type were identified. One strain was isolated in 2003 and might thus be one of the first cases of equine MRSA in France.
TI  - Multidrug- and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius as a cause of canine pyoderma: a case report.
AB  - A case of a dog with a long-term inflammatory skin disorder due to infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) is described. After initial diagnostics of MRSP, follow-up swabs of the dog (nose, skin) were taken twice after four and seven weeks. MRSP was constantly isolated from the skin and once from the nose. Since infected humans might be a source of reinfection, the owners of the dog were screened (nasal) three times during their pet's therapy. Thereby, the male owner was found to be colonized with MRSP once in the first sampling round. Comparative typing of all MRSP-isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), SCCmec typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, PCR-detection of the leukotoxin encoding operon (LukI) and the Staphylococcus intermedius-exfoliative toxin (SIET) as well as antimicrobial resistance profiling by broth microdilution revealed that all five MRSP isolates from the dog and the single isolate from the owner were indistinguishable by any of the applied methods. All isolates were assigned to a certain strain, a multidrug-resistant MRSP belonging to sequence type (ST) 71, spa type (t)05, harbouring SCCmecIII as well as the genes encoding LukI and SIET. In this case, a number of reasons might have contributed to therapy failure and re-infection, respectively (e. g. contact to other MRSP-colonized dogs, contact to MRSP-colonized humans, refusal to clip the dog's fur). In addition, MRSP-contaminated objects or surfaces in the household, which were difficult to disinfect or simply not considered as a potential source of MRSP, might have served as a source of re-infection. These results envision the possibility of a dog-to-human transmission of MRSP and the relevance of this aspect as a potential source of re-infection in cases of bacterial-supported long-term skin disorders in canine patients. First cases of MRSP infections in humans have been described only recently. However, the general pathogenic potential of multidrug resistant MRSP in humans is unknown so far and needs further investigation.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from canine urinary tract infection.
AB  - This study determined the diversity of species and antimicrobial resistance of staphylococci isolated from dogs with a presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI). Urine samples from 348 dogs with clinical signs of UTI, according to clinical examination and urinalysis, were processed for isolation of Staphylococcus. Colonies in pure culture were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. Seventy isolates of staphylococci were obtained (20.1%). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was the most frequent species (32.8%), followed by S. epidermidis (18.6%), S. simulans (15.7%), S. schleiferi schleiferi (11.4%), S. aureus (11.4%), S. schleiferi coagulans (7.2%) and S. saprophyticus (2.9%). All the isolates were resistant to at least 1 drug and 77.1% were multiresistant. The study reports the alarming antimicrobial resistance of members of the Staphylococcus genus isolated from canine UTI and highlights the importance of coagulase-negative staphylococci in its etiology.
TI  - Reclassification of the Listeria-CAMP test strain ATCC 49444 Staphylococcus aureus as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - ATCC 49444, originally designated as Staphylococcus aureus, has been cited as a component strain in the CAMP test for identification of Listeria monocytogenes. A polyphasic study, in which molecular data were combined with cytochemical properties and physiological characteristics, identified this isolate as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. The nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA and sodA genes from ATCC 49444 were determined and found to be identical to those of other S. pseudintermedius strains. Ribotyping analysis of ATCC 49444 indicated a low (0.2) similarity index with S. aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius strains but a similarity index of more than 0.66 with S. pseudintermedius isolates. A functional comparison of ATCC 49444 with S. aureus ATCC 25923 utilizing the CAMP test demonstrated equivalent hemolytic enhancement with L. monocytogenes isolates. While this study demonstrates that ATCC 49444 is a valid component strain for the CAMP test, it is proposed that ATCC 49444 be reclassified as S. pseudintermedius and that users worldwide be alerted to this reclassification and name change.
TI  - Further diversity of the Staphylococcus intermedius group and heterogeneity in the MboI restriction site used for Staphylococcus pseudintermedius species identification.
AB  - Species identification of 200 beta-hemolysin-producing canine staphylococcal isolates was performed using a recently described polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method (based on MboI restriction of a pta gene fragment), supplemented with biochemical testing and sequencing of housekeeping genes. The PCR-RFLP method misclassified a small fraction (approximately 1%) of the Staphylococcus pseudintermedius population as a result of heterogeneity in the MboI restriction site. A potentially novel species within the Staphylococcus intermedius group (SIG) was found, having closest similarity to S. intermedius based on sequence comparison to the genes sodA, pta, hsp60, tuf, and full-length 16S ribosomal DNA, thus demonstrating further species diversity within the SIG.
TI  - The first case of a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius infection after joint prosthesis implantation in a dog.
AB  - We have reported a bacterial infection in a dog with progressive dysplasia of the hips. Orthopedic surgery was performed. Seven weeks prior to the surgery, the patient was bitten by another dog. The postimplantation wound exuded for four days after the surgery. Microbiological analysis performed by standard identification techniques showed the presence of Staphylococcus intermedius, but an additional molecular analysis indicated S. pseudintermedius. This was followed by an evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of the strain which showed cefoxitin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doksycycline, erythromycin, and gentamicin resistance. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for selected antibiotics were reported. Resistance for cefoxitin indicates that methicillin resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains were present in individual macroorganisms, but they can expand and persist the colonization of other hosts.
TI  - Aerobic bacteria from mucous membranes, ear canals, and skin wounds of feral cats in Grenada, and the antimicrobial drug susceptibility of major isolates.
AB  - In a 2-year period 54 feral cats were captured in Grenada, West Indies, and a total of 383 samples consisting of swabs from rectum, vagina, ears, eyes, mouth, nose and wounds/abscesses, were cultured for aerobic bacteria and campylobacters. A total of 251 bacterial isolates were obtained, of which 205 were identified to species level and 46 to genus level. A commercial bacterial identification system (API/Biomerieux), was used for this purpose. The most common species was Escherichia coli (N=60), followed by Staphylococcus felis/simulans (40), S. hominis (16), S. haemolyticus (12), Streptococcus canis (9), Proteus mirabilis (8), Pasteurella multocida (7), Streptococcus mitis (7), Staphylococcus xylosus (7), S. capitis (6), S. chromogenes (4), S. sciuri (3), S. auricularis (2), S. lentus (2), S. hyicus (2), Streptococcus suis (2) and Pseudomonas argentinensis (2). Sixteen other isolates were identified to species level. A molecular method using 16S rRNA sequencing was used to confirm/identify 22 isolates. Salmonella or campylobacters were not isolated from rectal swabs. E. coli and S. felis/simulans together constituted 50% of isolates from vagina. S. felis/simulans was the most common species from culture positive ear and eye samples. P. multocida was isolated from 15% of mouth samples. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common isolates from nose and wound swabs. Staphylococcus aureus, or S. intemedius/S. pseudintermedius were not isolated from any sample. Antimicrobial drug resistance was minimal, most isolates being susceptible to all drugs tested against, including tetracycline.
TI  - Occurrence and molecular characteristics of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus  aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in an academic veterinary hospital.
AB  - Recently, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have been increasingly isolated from veterinarians and companion animals. With a view to preventing the spread of MRSA and MRSP, we evaluated the occurrence and molecular characteristics of each in a veterinary college. MRSA and MRSP were isolated from nasal samples from veterinarians, staff members, and veterinary students affiliated with a veterinary hospital. Using stepwise logistic regression, we identified two factors associated with MRSA carriage: (i) contact with an identified animal MRSA case (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.2 to 21.6) and (ii) being an employee (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.0 to 19.4). The majority of MRSA isolates obtained from individuals affiliated with the veterinary hospital and dog patients harbored spa type t002 and a type II staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), similar to the hospital-acquired MRSA isolates in Japan. MRSA isolates harboring spa type t008 and a type IV SCCmec were obtained from one veterinarian on three different sampling occasions and also from dog patients. MRSA carriers can also be a source of MRSA infection in animals. The majority of MRSP isolates (85.2%) carried hybrid SCCmec type II-III, and almost all the remaining MRSP isolates (11.1%) carried SCCmec type V. MRSA and MRSP were also isolated from environmental samples collected from the veterinary hospital (5.1% and 6.4%, respectively). The application of certain disinfection procedures is important for the prevention of nosocomial infection, and MRSA and MRSP infection control strategies should be adopted in veterinary medical practice.
TI  - Molecular analysis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius of feline origin from different European countries and North America.
AB  
TI  - Heterogeneity of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from atopic and healthy dogs.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is part of the normal canine flora but frequently causes pyoderma in canine atopic dermatitis (AD). This study aimed to determine whether particular S. pseudintermedius strains were associated with AD and/or pyoderma. Ninety-six S. pseudintermedius isolates from the ear, nares, perineum and lesions of 21 atopic and 16 healthy dogs were lysed with proteinase K and digested with 40 U SmaI. Restriction products were separated using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with an Oxford S. aureus control and lambda-ladder DNA concatomer markers. A dendrogram was constructed by the unweighted pair group method. All isolates showed a >/= 56% similarity coefficient. Nine distinct PFGE clusters were identified, as follows: five from both atopic and healthy dogs; three from atopic dogs only; and one from healthy dogs only. Nine clusters were isolated from the nares, eight from the perineum, five from the ears and six from pyoderma lesions. There were no significant differences in the frequency of isolation from atopic or healthy skin, body sites or infected lesions for any of the clusters. Two of six healthy dogs and 18 of 20 atopic dogs with multiple isolates had closely related isolates (less than three band differences) at more than one sampling site. Isolates from pyoderma lesions were closely related to at least one mucosal isolate in 11 of 16 dogs. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates appear to be heterogeneous, and colonization or infection of atopic skin was not associated with any particular strain or cluster of strains.
TI  - The prevalence of carriage of meticillin-resistant staphylococci by veterinary dermatology practice staff and their respective pets.
AB  - It has been shown that people and pets can harbour identical strains of meticillin-resistant (MR) staphylococci when they share an environment. Veterinary dermatology practitioners are a professional group with a high incidence of exposure to animals infected by Staphylococcus spp. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of carriage of MR Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), MR S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and MR S. schleiferi (MRSS) by veterinary dermatology practice staff and their personal pets. A swab technique and selective media were used to screen 171 veterinary dermatology practice staff and their respective pets (258 dogs and 160 cats). Samples were shipped by over-night carrier. Human subjects completed a 22-question survey of demographic and epidemiologic data relevant to staphylococcal transmission. The 171 human-source samples yielded six MRSA (3.5%), nine MRSP (5.3%) and four MRSS (2.3%) isolates, while 418 animal-source samples yielded eight MRSA (1.9%) 21 MRSP (5%), and two MRSS (0.5%) isolates. Concordant strains (genetically identical by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) were isolated from human subjects and their respective pets in four of 171 (2.9%) households: MRSA from one person/two pets and MRSP from three people/three pets. In seven additional households (4.1%), concordant strains were isolated from only the pets: MRSA in two households and MRSP in five households. There were no demographic or epidemiologic factors statistically associated with either human or animal carriage of MR staphylococci, or with concordant carriage by person-pet or pet-pet pairs. Lack of statistical associations may reflect an underpowered study.
TI  - Clonal spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in Europe  and North America: an international multicentre study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic and genotypic resistance profiles of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) and to examine the clonal distribution in Europe and North America. METHODS: A total of 103 MRSP isolates from dogs isolated from several countries in Europe, the USA and Canada were characterized. Isolates were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth dilution or gradient diffusion, and antimicrobial resistance genes were detected using a microarray. Genetic diversity was assessed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), PFGE and spa typing. Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements were characterized by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Thirteen different sequence types (STs), 18 PFGE types and 8 spa types were detected. The hybrid SCCmec element II-III described in a MRSP isolate was present in 75 (72.8%) isolates. The remaining isolates either had SCCmec type III (n=2), IV (n=6), V (n=14) or VII-241 (n=4) or were non-typeable (n=2). The most common genotypes were ST71(MLST)-J(PFGE)-t02(spa)-II-III(SCCmec) (56.3%) and ST68-C-t06-V (12.6%). In addition to mecA-mediated beta-lactam resistance, isolates showed resistance to trimethoprim [dfr(G)] (90.3%), gentamicin/kanamycin [aac(6')-Ie-aph(2')-Ia] (88.3%), kanamycin [aph(3')-III] (90.3%), streptomycin [ant(6')-Ia] (90.3%), streptothricin (sat4) (90.3%), macrolides and/or lincosamides [erm(B), lnu(A)] (89.3%), fluoroquinolones (87.4%), tetracycline [tet(M) and/or tet(K)] (69.9%), chloramphenicol (cat(pC221)) (57.3%) and rifampicin (1.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Two major clonal MRSP lineages have disseminated in Europe (ST71-J-t02-II-III) and North America (ST68-C-t06-V). Regardless of their geographical or clonal origin, the isolates displayed resistance to the major classes of antibiotics used in veterinary medicine and thus infections caused by MRSP isolates represent a serious therapeutic challenge.
TI  - Recognising and controlling risk factors for antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance amongst organisms such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas  aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and S. pseudintermedius has become a serious threat to veterinary small animal practice. There is an urgent need to adopt measures which will control and reduce this problem. Risk factors for infection by resistant organisms in small animals are now becoming recognised and appear to mirror those in human medicine. They include contact with carriers or infected animals, hospital admission, invasive procedures and antimicrobial therapy. Key recommendations which enable such risk factors to be avoided are: development of protocols which ensure that antimicrobials are used only when necessary, selection of appropriate antimicrobials and compliance with correct dosage and administration, limitation of prophylactic and perioperative use, and recording of treatment outcomes so that therapeutic regimens can be evaluated and modified if necessary. In addition, there is a need for rigorous hygiene protocols to prevent survival and transfer of resistant bacteria in clinics and hospitals.
TI  - A veterinary perspective on methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To familiarize the reader with the epidemiology, diagnosis, and infectious and zoonotic potential of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. DATA SOURCES: Original research publications, scientific reviews and abstracts, case reports, and conference proceedings. HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Staphylococcus aureus is a common human commensal organism; acquisition of genes encoding an altered penicillin-binding protein confers resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are often resistant to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs as well. Originally described as an important cause of nosocomial infection, MRSA colonization and infection are now often identified in humans outside healthcare settings. Like other S. aureus, MRSA may be present without clinical illness. However, when they do cause infection the consequences can be extremely serious. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: The major domestic animal species, including pets and livestock, may become contaminated, colonized, or infected with methicillin-resistant staphylococci, including MRSA. Dogs and cats are more likely to be colonized/infected with Staphylococcus pseudintermedius than S. aureus, but this pathogen can acquire genes encoding methicillin resistance (ie, MRSP). Diagnosis of MRSA or MRSP has implications not only for treatment of infected animals, but for potential zoonotic transmission. CONCLUSIONS: MRSA infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. Animals may be contaminated, colonized, or infected with MRSA, with implications for the animal's health and as a potential reservoir for human infection. Staphylococci other than S. aureus may also acquire genes for methicillin resistance, and these species can also result in animal and occasionally human morbidity or mortality.
TI  - Colonization and infection of the human host by staphylococci: adhesion, survival and immune evasion.
AB  - The natural habitat of Staphylococcus aureus in humans is the moist squamous epithelium of the anterior nares. Several bacterial surface proteins are implicated in promoting adhesion to desquamated epithelial cells. Clumping factor B (ClfB) and iron-regulated surface determinant A both promote nasal colonization in rodent models, and in the case of ClfB, humans. One of the ligands involved in adhesion is cytokeratin 10. Reduction in nasal colonization can be achieved by active and passive immunization. S. aureus is well endowed with secreted and surface components that compromise innate immune responses, particularly the function of neutrophils. S. aureus secretes proteins that reduce migration of neutrophils from the bloodstream to the site of infection by impeding diapedesis and receptors for chemotactic molecules. Several secreted proteins interfere with complement C3 and C5 convertases, thus reducing the level of C3b opsonin and the chemotactic peptide C5a. Host proteases are recruited to the cell surface to enhance destruction of opsonic C3b and IgG. Surface components ClfA, protein A and polysaccharide capsule compromise the recognition of opsonins on the bacterial cell surface. If engulfed by neutrophils the intracellular bacterium can resist reactive oxygen intermediates, nitric oxide radicals, defensin peptides and bactericidal proteins. A prior infection by S. aureus does not induce complete protective immunity. This could be due to immunosuppression caused by expression of superantigen proteins that disrupt normal activation of T cells and B cells during antigen presentation. By studying the molecular pathogenesis of S. aureus infections markers might be found for investigating S. pseudintermedius infections of dogs.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from healthy horses and horse personnel in Italy.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) were isolated from nasal swabs of 56 of 159 (35.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.9-43.2%) healthy horses. Two nasal swabs were collected from each horse; 43 of 159 (27%; 95% CI: 20.5-34.8%) of the cohort were colonized by MRS strains in 1 nostril, while in the remaining 13 of 159 (8.2%; 95% CI: 4.6-13.9%), different or identical MRS strains were isolated in both nostrils. Of the 29 humans in close contact with the horses tested, 4 (13.8%; 95% CI: 4.5-32.6%) were found to be carriers of MRS. All isolates were coagulase negative with the exception of 2 coagulase-positive MRS strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, both isolated from horses. To assay the methicillin resistance, a susceptibility test to oxacillin with standardized disk diffusion method, a PBP-2a latex agglutination test, and a methicillin resistance gene (mecA) polymerase chain reaction assay were performed. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of isolates from horses and humans in close contact with the horses revealed similarity. The results suggest evidence of transmission between animals, from animals to humans, and vice versa.
TI  - Multiplex-PCR method for species identification of coagulase-positive staphylococci.
AB  - In veterinary medicine, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS) other than Staphylococcus aureus have frequently been misidentified as being S. aureus strains, as they have several phenotypic traits in common. There has been no reliable method to distinguish among CoPS species in veterinary clinical laboratories. In the present study, we sequenced the thermonuclease (nuc) genes of staphylococcal species and devised a multiplex-PCR (M-PCR) method for species identification of CoPS by targeting the nuc gene locus. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity, we used this M-PCR method on 374 staphylococcal strains that had been previously identified to the species level by an hsp60 sequencing approach. We could successfully distinguish between S. aureus, S. hyicus, S. schleiferi, S. intermedius, S. pseudintermedius, and S. delphini groups A and B. The present method was both sensitive (99.8%) and specific (100%). Our M-PCR assay will allow the routine species identification of CoPS isolates from various animal species for clinical veterinary diagnosis.
TI  - Occurrence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria in healthy dogs and cats presented to private veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario: A preliminary study.
AB  - The prevalence and patterns of antimicrobial susceptibility of fecal Escherichia  coli, Salmonella spp., extended beta-lactamase producing E. coli (ESBL-E. coli), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) were determined for healthy dogs (n = 188) and cats (n = 39) from veterinary hospitals in southern Ontario that had not had recent exposure to antimicrobials. The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in E. coli was as follows: streptomycin (dogs - 17%, cats - 2%), ampicillin (dogs - 13%, cats - 4%), cephalothin (dogs - 13%, cats - < 1%), and tetracycline (dogs - 11%, cats - 2%). Eleven percent of dogs and 15% of cats had isolates that were resistant to at least 2 antimicrobials. Cephamycinase (CMY)-2 producing E. coli was cultured from 2 dogs. No Salmonella spp., ESBL-E. coli, MRSA, or MRSP isolates were recovered. The observed prevalence of resistance in commensal E. coli from this population was lower than that previously reported in companion animals, but a small percentage of dogs may be a reservoir for CMY-2 E. coli.
TI  - Species distribution and antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from canine otitis externa.
AB  - The diversity of species of the genus Staphylococcus sp. and the antimicrobial resistance of isolates from 151 unmedicated dogs of both sexes with a clinical diagnosis of otitis were recorded. Ninety-one isolates of Staphylococcus spp. were identified by biochemical reactions and tested for susceptibility to 15 antimicrobials. Coagulase-positive species were most common; S. pseudintermedius (38.4%), S. schleiferi schleiferi (15.4%), S. aureus (14.3%), S. epidermidis (11%), S. simulans (11%), S. schleiferi coagulans (8.8%) and S. saprophyticus (1.1%). All the isolates showed resistance to at least one drug and 89% were multiresistant. Amoxicillin combined with clavulanic acid and oxacillin were the most effective, while resistance was widely observed for neomycin and erythromycin. The results highlight the recognition and the potential need for bacterial culture with species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility tests for appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine and Tris-EDTA.
AB  - Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of a commercial ear antiseptic containing chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA (Otodine) were determined by broth microdilution for 150 isolates representing the most common pathogens associated with canine otitis. The microorganisms were classified into three groups according to their levels of susceptibility. The most susceptible group included Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Malassezia pachydermatis, Streptococcus canis and Corynebacterium auriscanis, which were generally killed by 1 : 64 dilution of the antiseptic product (MBC = 23/0.8 microg/mL of chlorhexidine/Tris-EDTA). The most resistant organism was Proteus mirabilis, which survived up to 1 : 8 dilution of the product (MBC = 375/12 microg/mL). Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus displayed intermediate MBCs ranging between 188/6 and 47/1.5 microg/mL. Interestingly, S. pseudintermedius was more susceptible than S. aureus, and no significant difference was observed between meticillin-resistant and meticillin-susceptible isolates within each species, indicating that antiseptic use is unlikely to co-select for meticillin resistance. Although the concentrations required for killing (MBCs) varied considerably with microorganism type, the combination of chlorhexidine 0.15% and Tris-EDTA was active against all the pathogens most commonly involved in canine otitis.
TI  - Low rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococcal colonization  of veterinary personnel in Hong Kong.
AB  - Elevated rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriage have been reported in veterinary personnel, suggesting an occupational colonization risk. Hong Kong veterinary personnel (n = 150) were sampled for coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS) nasal colonization. Risk factors for colonization were assessed by questionnaire. Isolates were identified and antibiotic susceptibility determined. All CPS isolates were investigated for mecA carriage, SCCmec type and PVL genes. Two subjects were colonized with methicillin-resistant CPS: one with MRSA (spa type t002 (CC5), SCCmec type II) and one with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) (MLST type ST71, SCCmec type II-III). MLST type ST71 S. pseudintermedius strain is the predominant MRSP clone circulating in dogs in Europe and in Hong Kong. The low MR-CPS colonization rate may be associated with low levels of large animal exposure or low rates of MRSA colonization of companion animals in Hong Kong. Colonization with non-aureus CPS, which may cause human infection, must also be considered in veterinary personnel.
TI  - Coagulase positive staphylococcal colonization of humans and their household pets.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus colonization was identified in 67/242 (28%) humans, 19/132  (14%) dogs, and 7/161 (4.3%) cats in households in Ontario, with methicillin-resistant S. aureus present in 8 (3.3%) humans, 2 (1.5%) dogs, and 0 cats. Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from 8 (4.1%) humans, 61 (46%) dogs, and 11 (6.8%) cats, with methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius detected in 1 (0.4%) human, 6 (4.5%) dogs, and 2 (1.2%) cats. Staphylococcus schleiferi subspecies coagulans was isolated from 1 (0.8%) dog. Regular hand washing was a protective factor for S. pseudintermedius colonization in humans. Indistinguishable S. aureus isolates were present in humans and their dogs in 4/8 households, where S. aureus was isolated concurrently from humans and dogs. Similarly, indistinguishable human and feline strains were isolated in 1 of 2 households with concurrent human/feline colonization. Indistinguishable canine and human S. pseudintermedius isolates were present in 4/9 of households with a human who was colonized.
TI  - Identification of first exfoliative toxin in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hyicus, and Staphylococcus chromogenes are  known to cause skin infections in human or animals by producing exfoliative toxins (ETs). Staphylococcus pseudintermedius can also cause canine pyoderma, but no exfoliative toxins or similar toxins have been reported. PCR with degenerate primers targeted to the conserved regions in ETA, ETB, and ETD from S. aureus and SHETB from S. hyicus, and subsequent chromosome walking identified a novel gene, designated as exi (exfoliative toxin of pseudintermedius) in S. pseudintermedius. EXI had significant homologies with the exfoliative toxins (43-68% identity), particularly with ETB (67.1%), ETD (67.9%), and SHETB (65.1%). Phylogenetic analysis showed close relation between EXI and ETB with a bootstrap value of 80%. Neonatal mice injected with the crude proteins from the culture supernatant or recombinant EXI showed gross blisters and/or characteristic skin exfoliation. The prevalence of exi assessed by dot-blot hybridization was 23.3% (10/43) in S. pseudintermedius isolates from canine pyoderma. The EXI reported herein is the first exfoliative toxin identified in S. pseudintermedius.
TI  - Diversity of Staphylococcus species strains based on partial kat (catalase) gene  sequences and design of a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay for identification and differentiation of coagulase-positive species (S. aureus, S. delphini, S. hyicus, S. intermedius, S. pseudintermedius, and S. schleiferi subsp. coagulans).
AB  - A set of degenerate PCR primers was designed and used to amplify and sequence about 75% of the catalase (kat) gene from each of 49 staphylococcal strains. In some strains of Staphylococcus xylosus, S. saprophyticus, and S. equorum, two catalase genes, katA and katB, were found. A phylogenetic tree was generated and showed diversities among 66 partial (about 900-bp) staphylococcal kat nucleotide sequences (including 17 sequences found in GenBank) representing 26 different species. The topology of this tree showed a distribution of staphylococcal species similar, but not identical, to those reported previously based on 16S rRNA, hsp60, sodA, rpoB, tuf, and gap genes. The kat gene sequences were less conserved than those of 16S rRNA, rpoB, hsp60, and tuf genes and slightly more conserved than those of the gap gene. Therefore, kat gene sequence analysis may provide an additional marker for inferring phylogenetic relationships of staphylococci. Moreover, the discrete nucleotide polymorphism revealed in this gene could be exploited for rapid, low-cost identification of staphylococcal species through PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. In this study, a PCR-RFLP assay performed by using only the TaqI restriction enzyme was successfully developed for rapid unequivocal identification/differentiation, at species and subspecies levels, of coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS). The assay was validated by testing the DNA from 100 staphylococcal strains, including reference and wild CPS strains isolated from different environments. This reliable, rapid, and low-cost approach (requiring about 6 h from DNA isolation to the achievement of results and <5 Euros for each strain tested) allowed unambiguous identification of all the strains assayed, including the newly described S. delphini and S. pseudintermedius CPS species.
TI  - Infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius masquerading as cefoxitin susceptible in a dog.
AB  - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 2-year-old dog was evaluated because of complications that developed following tibial plateau leveling osteotomy. Infection of the surgical site developed following removal of the failed implant. CLINICAL FINDINGS: The dog was lame with evidence of a deep surgical site infection, and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from the surgical site. Results of in vitro testing indicated that the isolate was resistant to multiple antimicrobials but susceptible to cefoxitin. Subsequent testing confirmed that the isolate was methicillin-resistant S pseudintermedius and was in fact resistant to cefoxitin. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: On the basis of results of follow-up testing, doxycycline was administered before and after surgery to remove the surgical implant. The dog recovered without further complications. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Findings suggested that certain strains of methicillin-resistant S pseudintermedius, which appears to be an emerging pathogen in dogs, may be falsely identified as methicillin susceptible on the basis of results of testing for cefoxitin susceptibility because cefoxitin may not induce the mecA gene as reliably in S pseudintermedius as it does in Staphylococcus aureus. Isolates of S pseudintermedius should be considered to likely be methicillin resistant when multidrug resistance is identified, even if susceptibility to some beta-lactam antimicrobials is reported.
TI  - Evaluation of Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive criteria for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from dogs.
AB  - The Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute published in 2008 new interpretive criteria for the identification of methicillin resistance in staphylococci isolated from animals. The sensitivity of the 2008 interpretive criteria for mecA gene-positive Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, compared with the previous criteria of 2004, was investigated. Thirty clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius from dogs were used. The presence of the mecA gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction. The minimum inhibitory concentration for oxacillin was determined by broth microdilution. The 2008 breakpoint of >or=4 microg/ml for methicillin resistance resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.3% (22/30). The 2004 breakpoint guideline of >or=0.5 microg/ml resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 97% (29/30). For oxacillin disk diffusion, the 2008 interpretive criterion of <or=10 mm for methicillin resistance resulted in a sensitivity of 70% (21/30). If intermediate isolates (11 or 12 mm) were considered resistant, the sensitivity was 93% (28/30). If intermediate isolates (11 or 12 mm) were considered resistant, the sensitivity was 93% (28/30). Application of the 2004 interpretive criterion of <or=17 mm resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (30/30). For cefoxitin disk diffusion, the interpretive criterion of <or=21 mm for methicillin resistance (as used for Staphylococcus aureus) resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 6.7% (2/30). The interpretive criterion of <or=24 mm (as used for coagulase-negative staphylococci) resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 43.3% (13/30). With the use of 2008 interpretive criteria, all 3 tests produced what we consider to be an unacceptable level of false negative results. Our findings also suggest that cefoxitin disk diffusion is an inappropriate screening test for methicillin resistance of canine S. pseudintermedius.
TI  - Identification of a predominant multilocus sequence type, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis cluster, and novel staphylococcal chromosomal cassette in clinical isolates of mecA-containing, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius.
AB  - Methicillin resistance encoded by the mecA gene is increasingly observed in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Little is known about the population genetics of veterinary staphylococci bearing methicillin resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the relatedness of resistant bacteria and to compare them with methicillin-susceptible isolates. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) fragment profiling were performed on methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) and methicillin-susceptible S. pseudintermedius (MSSP) isolates obtained from canine samples submitted to the veterinary teaching hospital bacteriology service between 2006 and 2008. Multilocus sequence typing detected 20 different sequence types, 16 of which were not previously described. Methicillin-resistant isolates were predominantly ST 68, possessed the Staphylococcus aureus-associated staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) type V(T) and fell within the largest PFGE cluster; whereas methicillin-susceptible strains were more genetically diverse. This suggests that most methicillin resistance within the population of isolates tested originated from a single source which has persisted and expanded for several years.

TI  - Staphylococcal colonization of mucosal and lesional skin sites in atopic and healthy dogs.
AB  - Staphylococcal colonization was compared in healthy dogs and in dogs with atopic  dermatitis. Bacterial swabs were collected from the nasal mucosa, ear and perineum of 43 healthy and 24 atopic dogs and also from potentially infected skin lesions of the atopic dogs. Coagulase positive staphylococcal isolates were identified to the species level. At the time of this study Staphylococcus intermedius was considered a single species but has since been recognized as comprising at least three species with canine isolates believed to belong to Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Of atopic dogs, 87.5% were colonized with S. intermedius compared to only 37.2% of healthy dogs. The ear was the only carriage site that showed any significant difference in S. intermedius isolation between healthy and atopic dogs. The perineum represented the most frequently colonized mucosal site for both groups. Sampling the nasal mucosa alone identified 71.4% of atopic and 37.5% of healthy S. intermedius carriers. Inclusion of a perineal swab identified 100% of atopic and 93.8% of healthy carriers. S. intermedius was isolated from all the lesional sites sampled from atopic dogs. Significantly fewer dogs were colonized by Staphylococcus aureus than S. intermedius, and there was no significant difference between S. aureus colonization of atopic and healthy dogs. S. aureus was not recovered from any lesions in atopic dogs. The results show that S. intermedius carriage is more prevalent in atopic dogs compared to healthy dogs and that to identify staphylococcal carriers both the nasal mucosa and the perineum should be sampled.
TI  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius expresses surface proteins that closely resemble  those from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a commensal of dogs that is implicated in the  pathogenesis of canine pyoderma. This study aimed to determine if S. pseudintermedius expresses surface proteins resembling those from Staphylococcus aureus and to characterise them. S. pseudintermedius strain 326 was shown to adhere strongly to purified fibrinogen, fibronectin and cytokeratin 10. It adhered to the alpha-chain of fibrinogen which, along with binding to cytokeratin 10, is the hallmark of clumping factor B of S. aureus, a surface protein that is in part responsible for colonisation of the human nares. Ligand-affinity blotting with cell-wall extracts demonstrated that S. pseudintermedius 326 expressed a cell-wall anchored fibronectin binding protein which recognised the N-terminal 29kDa fragment. The ability to bind fibronectin is an important attribute of pathogenic S. aureus and is associated with the ability of S. aureus to colonise skin of human atopic dermatitis patients. S. pseudintermedius genomic DNA was probed with labelled DNA amplified from the serine-aspartate repeat encoding region of clfA of S. aureus. This probe hybridised to a single SpeI fragment of S. pseudintermedius DNA. In the cell-wall extract of S. pseudintermedius 326, a 180kDa protein was discovered which bound to fibrinogen by ligand-affinity blotting and reacted in a Western blot with antibodies raised against the serine-aspartate repeat region of ClfA and the B-repeats of SdrD of S. aureus. It is proposed that this is an Sdr protein with B-repeats that has an A domain that binds to fibrinogen. Whether it is the same protein that binds cytokeratin 10 is not clear.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in veterinary medicine.
AB  - Staphylococci are important opportunistic pathogens in most animal species. Among the most relevant species are the coagulase positive species Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius. Methicillin resistance has emerged as an important problem in both of these organisms, with significant concerns about animal and public health. The relative importance of these staphylococci on different animal species varies, as do the concerns about zoonotic transmission, yet it is clear that both present a challenge to veterinary medicine.
TI  - Quorum sensing in veterinary pathogens: mechanisms, clinical importance and future perspectives.
AB  - Under certain circumstances the individuals of a bacterial population may find advantages in acting together and making "collective decisions". This phenomenon is better known as quorum sensing. When the concentration of signal molecules produced by the surrounding bacteria exceeds a certain threshold, the bacterial population acts as a single organism, collectively expressing virulence genes, biofilm forming genes, etc. Several mechanisms of quorum sensing are discussed, each with its distinct signal molecules and respective receptors. Some of these mechanisms are restricted to sensing intraspecies signalling, but interspecies and even interkingdom signalling have also been described. Several veterinary pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella Typhimurium use quorum sensing as a means to optimize virulence gene expression and host colonization. Therefore, targeting of the QS mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for combating bacterial infections, also in veterinary medicine.
TI  - Evaluation of susceptibility test breakpoints used to predict mecA-mediated resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from dogs.
AB  - Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute interpretive breakpoints for in vitro susceptibility tests that predict mecA-mediated oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates from animals have been changed twice in the past decade. Moreover, there are no counterpart recommendations for human isolates of S. pseudintermedius. Individual medical and veterinary laboratories variably use interpretive breakpoints identical to those recommended for use with Staphylococcus aureus or identical to those recommended for use with coagulase-negative staphylococci. The purpose of the current study was to examine correlations between oxacillin disk diffusion, oxacillin gradient diffusion, oxacillin microbroth dilution, and cefoxitin disk diffusion tests used to predict mecA-mediated resistance in S. pseudintermedius and to retrospectively estimate, from disk diffusion zone diameter measurements, the prevalence and rate of increase of oxacillin resistance among canine S. pseudintermedius isolates submitted to a veterinary teaching hospital laboratory. Oxacillin disk diffusion zone diameters of <or=17 mm and oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations of >or=0.5 microg/ml were highly correlated with detection of mecA in canine S. pseudintermedius isolates by polymerase chain reaction. MecA-mediated resistance among S. pseudintermedius isolates from dogs increased from less than 5% in 2001 to near 30% in 2007. More than 90% of the methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius isolates in 2006 and 2007 were also resistant to representatives of >or=4 additional antimicrobial drug classes. Cefoxitin disk diffusion with the resistance breakpoint set at <or=24 mm significantly underestimated the presence of mecA in S. pseudintermedius.
TI  - In vitro activity of fusidic acid and mupirocin against coagulase-positive staphylococci from pets.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiresistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP) have emerged as important pathogens in animal infections. Associated therapeutic problems and the zoonotic potential of staphylococci have renewed interest in topical antibiotics for treatment and carrier decolonization. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are used topically in humans and animals but resistant strains isolated from people are increasing. This study investigates the in vitro activity of fusidic acid and mupirocin against coagulase-positive staphylococci from pets. METHODS: A collection of 287 staphylococci was examined, comprising 102 MRSA, 102 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, 71 S. pseudintermedius and 12 MRSP from canine and feline infections and carrier sites isolated in the UK and Germany. MICs were determined by the agar dilution method according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) standards. RESULTS: The majority (89.7%) of all MICs were </=0.25 mg/L. High MICs were observed for seven MRSA isolates (five with an MIC of fusidic acid of 512 mg/L, one with an MIC of fusidic acid of 1024 mg/L and one with with an MIC of mupirocin of 16 mg/L). MICs of both antibiotics were </=2 mg/L for all MRSP. Infection isolates had higher MICs than those isolated from carriage sites for both antibiotics (P </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In all but seven MRSA isolates, MICs were below the concentrations achievable experimentally at application sites suggesting therapeutic efficacy of both antibiotics in infections involving multiresistant staphylococci and for decolonization of carriers. However, the seven MRSA with high MICs, all of the dominant UK human hospital lineages, highlight the importance of monitoring treatment success as resistant strains may occur in animals.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius detected in the BfT-GermVet monitoring programme 2004-2006 in Germany.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: During recent years, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains from animals have become the focus of various studies. In the present study, coagulase-positive staphylococci obtained from pigs, dogs and cats suffering from acute infections, which had been collected in the BfT-GermVet monitoring programme in Germany and phenotypically identified as oxacillin-resistant, were characterized. METHODS: The staphylococci were comparatively investigated for their resistance phenotypes and genotypes. Resistance genes were identified by PCR. MRSA strains were further characterized by SmaI macrorestriction analysis and spa typing to assess their genomic relationships. RESULTS: Among the 248 strains tested, 7 strains (5 porcine S. aureus and 2 canine Staphylococcus pseudintermedius) carried the resistance gene mecA. Gentamicin resistance was based on the presence of the gene aacA/aphD while three different tetracycline resistance genes, tet(K), tet(L) and tet(M), alone or in combinations, were detected. The single macrolide/lincosamide-resistant strain carried an erm(A) gene. All MRSA strains proved to be non-typeable by SmaI macrorestriction analysis and exhibited the spa types t011 (four strains) or t034 (one strain). CONCLUSIONS: Based on their spa types and their non-respondence to SmaI digestion, all five porcine MRSA strains resembled MRSA strains of multilocus sequence type ST398, previously detected among pigs in neighbouring countries such as The Netherlands or Denmark. The results of this study indicate that such strains are also involved in defined disease conditions of pigs from various parts of Germany.
TI  - Population genetic structure of the Staphylococcus intermedius group: insights into agr diversification and the emergence of methicillin-resistant strains.
AB  - The population genetic structure of the animal pathogen Staphylococcus intermedius is poorly understood. We carried out a multilocus sequence phylogenetic analysis of isolates from broad host and geographic origins to investigate inter- and intraspecies diversity. We found that isolates phenotypically identified as S. intermedius are differentiated into three closely related species, S. intermedius, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, and Staphylococcus delphini. S. pseudintermedius, not S. intermedius, is the common cause of canine pyoderma and occasionally causes zoonotic infections of humans. Over 60 extant STs were identified among the S. pseudintermedius isolates examined, including several that were distributed on different continents. As the agr quorum-sensing system of staphylococci is thought to have evolved along lines of speciation within the genus, we examined the allelic variation of agrD, which encodes the autoinducing peptide (AIP). Four AIP variants were encoded by S. pseudintermedius isolates, and identical AIP variants were shared among the three species, suggesting that a common quorum-sensing capacity has been conserved in spite of species differentiation in largely distinct ecological niches. A lack of clonal association of agr alleles suggests that assortive recombination may have contributed to the distribution of agr diversity. Finally, we discovered that the recent emergence of methicillin-resistant strains was due to multiple acquisitions of the mecA gene by different S. pseudintermedius clones found on different continents. Taken together, these data have resolved the population genetic structure of the S. intermedius group, resulting in new insights into its ancient and recent evolution.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal colonization in dogs entering a veterinary teaching hospital.
AB  - Nasal, axillary and rectal swabs were collected from 193 dogs admitted to the Ontario Veterinary College Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Enrichment culture was performed and coagulase positive staphylococci were identified via standard methods. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius was isolated from 4/193 (2.1%) dogs, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus schleiferi subsp. coagulans were each isolated from 1/193 (0.5%) dogs. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus intermedius was not identified. All S. pseudintermedius isolates were unrelated on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Evaluation of the epidemiology of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal colonization is necessary to understand the apparent emergence of these strains and to develop appropriate control strategies.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in a veterinary teaching hospital.
AB  - We surveyed methicillin-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococcus (MRCPS) strains from 57 (26 inpatient and 31 outpatient) dogs and 20 veterinary staff in a veterinary teaching hospital. From the staff, three MRCPS strains were isolated, and two were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In contrast, 18 MRCPS strains were detected in both inpatient (12 of 26 [46.2%]) and outpatient (6 of 31 [19.4%]) dogs. Among them, only one strain was MRSA. Using direct sequencing of sodA and hsp60 genes, the 18 MRCPS strains other than MRSA from a staff and 17 dogs, were finally identified as Staphylococcus pseudintermedius, a novel species of Staphylococcus from a cat. All of the methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) strains were multidrug resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and levofloxacin. Most of the MRSP strains showed high-level resistance to oxacillin (>/=128 mug/ml, 15 of 18 [83.3%]), and 10 of 15 (66.7%) high-level oxacillin-resistant MRSP strains carried type III SCCmec. DNA fingerprinting of MRSP strains by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis yielded eight clusters: clone A with four subtypes, clone B with four subtypes, clone C with three subtypes, and five other different single clones. MRSP strains from the staff and some inpatient and outpatient dogs shared three major clones (clones A, B, and C), but the strains of the other five different clusters were distributed independently among inpatient or outpatient dogs. This genetic diversity suggested that the MRSP strains were not only acquired in this veterinary teaching hospital but also acquired in primary veterinary clinics in the community. To our knowledge, this is the first report of MRSP in dogs and humans in a veterinary institution.
TI  - Dissemination of the gene encoding exfoliative toxin of Staphylococcus intermedius among strains isolated from dogs during routine microbiological diagnostics.
AB  - Phenotypic properties and species-specific PCR tests based on the nuc gene of Staphylococcus intermedius and S. aureus, and a conserved region of 16S rDNA were used to identify 45 S. intermedius and four S. aureus isolated from samples of dogs during routine diagnostics. Four S. pseudintermedius strains used for control purposes reacted positively with the S. intermedius nuc PCR showing the close relationship between both species. Investigating the 45 S. intermedius and four S. pseudintermedius strains for the prevalence of the exfoliative toxin SIET encoding gene yielded the presence of the gene for 21 of the S. intermedius and two of the S. pseudintermedius strains. Partial sequencing of the toxin gene of a single S. intermedius strain and comparing this sequence with that obtained from GenBank revealed an almost complete identity. The presence of the exfoliative toxin gene could mainly be found among S. intermedius isolated from skin and wound infections and from otitis externa possibly indicating a role of this toxin for the clinical symptoms.
TI  - First case of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius infection in a human.
AB  - We present the first clinical report of a Staphylococcus pseudintermedius infection in a human. Biochemically, S. pseudintermedius can be easily misidentified as S. aureus. Therefore, the final microbiological identification requires the combination of phenotypic and genotypic tests.
