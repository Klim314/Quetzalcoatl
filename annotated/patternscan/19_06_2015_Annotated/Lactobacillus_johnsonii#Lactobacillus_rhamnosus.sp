TI  == effects of lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus reuteri on gut barrier function and heat shock proteins in intestinal porcine epithelial cells.
AB  == heat shock proteins (hsps) are a set of highly conserved proteins that can serve  as intestinal gate keepers in gut homeostasis. here, effects of a probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), and two novel porcine isolates, lactobacillus johnsonii strain p47-hy and lactobacillus reuteri strain p43-huv, on cytoprotective hsp expression and gut barrier function, were investigated in a porcine ipec-j2 intestinal epithelial cell line model. the ipec-j2 cells polarized on a permeable filter exhibited villus-like cell phenotype with development of apical microvilli. western blot analysis detected hsp expression in ipec-j2 and revealed that l. johnsonii and l. reuteri strains were able to significantly induce hsp27, despite high basal expression in ipec-j2, whereas lgg did not. for hsp72, only the supernatant of l. reuteri induced the expression, which was comparable to the heat shock treatment, which indicated that hsp72 expression was more stimulus specific. the protective effect of lactobacilli was  further studied in ipec-j2 under an enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) challenge. etec caused intestinal barrier destruction, as reflected by loss of cell-cell contact, reduced ipec-j2 cell viability and transepithelial electrical  resistance, and disruption of tight junction protein zonula occludens-1. in contrast, the l. reuteri treatment substantially counteracted these detrimental effects and preserved the barrier function. l. johnsonii and lgg also achieved barrier protection, partly by directly inhibiting etec attachment. together, the  results indicate that specific strains of lactobacillus can enhance gut barrier function through cytoprotective hsp induction and fortify the cell protection against etec challenge through tight junction protein modulation and direct interaction with pathogens.

TI  == in vitro screening of selected probiotic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from traditional fermented cabbage and cucumber.
AB  == most important during probiotic selection are gastric acid and bile tolerance, the adhesion to the luminal epithelium to colonize the lower gastrointestinal tract of a human and safety for human consumption. the aim of this study was to evaluate the selected probiotic in vitro properties of lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from traditional fermented food. a total 38 strains were isolated from the pickled samples and 14 were identified as lactobacillus spp. the survival of  almost all strains after incubation at ph 2.5 did not change markedly, and remained at above 90 % (10(9) cfu/ml). the strains also exhibited a high survival rate at ph 3.5 (>90 %), whereas ph 1.5 all were died. just four strains could survive 90 min. at ph 1.5 (<39 %). the incubation with 0.2 % bile salt solution resulted in a survival rates of 81-94 % after 24 h, whereas after incubation in 2 and 4 % bile salt solution it was 59-94 %. all tested strains showed very good and good resistance to 0.4 % phenol addition, however only lb. johnsonii k4 was able to multiply. the hydrophobic nature of the cell surface of the tested strains was moderated recording hydrophobicity of lb. johnsonii k4 and lb. rhamnosus k3 above 60 %. safety evaluation excluded four of tested strains as candidate probiotics, according to antibiotic resistance patterns and certain metabolic activities. on the basis on the results 10 of the selected lactobacillus strains are safe and can survive under gastrointestinal conditions, which requires them to future in vitro and in vivo probiotic studies.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the mucin-adhesion ability and probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1.
AB  == aims: in this report, we characterized the probiotic potential of lactobacillus mucosae lm1, focusing on its in vitro mucin-adhesion abilities. methods and results: screening assays were used to evaluate lm1. previous studies on lact. mucosae species have been performed, but few have examined the ability of this species to adhere to and colonize the intestinal mucosa. thus, adhesion, aggregation and pathogen inhibition assays of lm1 along with microbial adhesion to solvents (mats) assay were carried out in comparison with another putative probiotic, lactobacillus johnsonii pf01, and the commercial strain, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. based on mats assay, the cell surfaces of the lactobacilli strains  were found to be hydrophobic and highly electron-donating, but the average hydropathy (gravy) index of predicted surface-exposed proteins in the lm1 genome  indicated that most were hydrophilic. lm1 showed the highest adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity among the strains tested and significantly inhibited the adhesion of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium kccm 40253. correlations among adhesion, aggregation and hydrophobicity, as well as between coaggregation and displacement of e. coli, were observed. conclusions: increased adhesion may not always correlate with increased pathogen inhibition due to various strain-specific mechanisms. nevertheless, lm1 has promising probiotic properties that can be explored further using a genomics approach. significance and impact of the study: our data on adhesion of lm1 strain showed a significant correlation between adhesion, hydrophobicity of cell surface and autoaggregation. this study gives basic knowledge for the elucidation of the adhesion mechanism of lactobacillus sp. and  prediction of its adherence in specific host models.

TI  == anti-infective activities of lactobacillus strains in the human intestinal microbiota: from probiotics to gastrointestinal anti-infectious biotherapeutic agents.
AB  == a vast and diverse array of microbial species displaying great phylogenic, genomic, and metabolic diversity have colonized the gastrointestinal tract. resident microbes play a beneficial role by regulating the intestinal immune system, stimulating the maturation of host tissues, and playing a variety of roles in nutrition and in host resistance to gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens. the mechanisms by which the resident microbial species combat gastrointestinal pathogens are complex and include competitive metabolic interactions and the production of antimicrobial molecules. the human intestinal  microbiota is a source from which lactobacillus probiotic strains have often been isolated. only six probiotic lactobacillus strains isolated from human intestinal microbiota, i.e., l. rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, l. johnsonii ncc 533, l. acidophilus lb, and l. reuteri dsm 17938, have been well characterized with regard to their potential antimicrobial effects against the major gastric and enteric bacterial pathogens and rotavirus. in this review, we describe the current knowledge concerning the experimental antibacterial activities, including antibiotic-like and cell-regulating activities, and therapeutic effects demonstrated in well-conducted, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of these probiotic lactobacillus strains. what is known about the antimicrobial activities supported by the molecules secreted by such probiotic lactobacillus strains suggests that they constitute a promising new source for the development of innovative anti-infectious agents that act luminally and intracellularly in the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == identification of lactobacillus strains of goose origin using maldi-tof mass spectrometry and 16s-23s rdna intergenic spacer pcr analysis.
AB  == the objective of our study was to identify lactobacillus sp. strains of goose origin using maldi-tof mass spectrometry, its-pcr and its-pcr/rflp. all three techniques proved to be valuable tools for identification of avian lactobacilli and produced comparable classification results. lactobacillus strains were isolated from 100% of geese aged 3 weeks to 4 years, but from only 25% of chicks  aged 1-10 days. among the 104 strains isolated, we distinguished 14 lactobacillus species. the dominant species was lactobacillus salivarius (35.6%), followed by lactobacillus johnsonii (18.3%), lactobacillus ingluviei (11.5%) and lactobacillus agilis (7.7%). the intact-cell maldi-tof mass spectrometry enabled  rapid species identification of the lactobacilli with minimal pretreatment. however, it produced more than one identification result for 11.5% examined strains (mainly of the species l. johnsonii). its-pcr distinguished 12 genotypes  among the isolates, but was not able to differentiate closely related strains, i.e. between lactobacillus amylovorus and lactobacillus kitasatonis and between lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus zeae. these species were differentiated by its-pcr/rflp using the restriction enzymes taqi and msei. the results obtained indicate that its-pcr and its-pcr/rflp assays could be used not only for interspecific, but also for intraspecific, typing.

TI  == immune system stimulation by probiotic microorganisms.
AB  == probiotic organisms are claimed to offer several functional properties including  stimulation of immune system. this review is presented to provide detailed informations about how probiotics stimulate our immune system. lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota, bifidobacterium animalis bb-12, lactobacillus johnsonii la1, bifidobacterium lactis dr10, and saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii are the most investigated probiotic cultures for their immunomodulation properties. probiotics can enhance nonspecific cellular immune response characterized by activation of macrophages, natural killer (nk) cells, antigen-specific cytotoxic t-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in strain-specific and dose-dependent manner. mixture and type (gram-positive and gram-negative) of probiotic organisms may induce different cytokine responses. supplementation of probiotic organisms in infancy could help prevent immune-mediated diseases in childhood, whereas their intervention in pregnancy could affect fetal immune parameters, such as cord blood interferon (ifn)-gamma levels, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 levels, and breast milk immunoglobulin (ig)a. probiotics that can be delivered via fermented milk or yogurt could improve the gut mucosal immune system by increasing the number of iga(+) cells and cytokine-producing cells in the effector site of the intestine.

TI  == probiotic screening and safety evaluation of lactobacillus strains from plants, artisanal goat cheese, human stools, and breast milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to select autochthonous strains of lactobacillus from stools of healthy infants and adults, human milk, artisanal goat cheese, and fruits and vegetables according to their probiotic properties and safety. from 421 strains of lactobacillus isolated, 102 (24.2%) were shown to be tolerant to gastric ph and bile salts; they were used to determine their anti-helicobacter pylori (agar diffusion assay), antioxidant (oxygen radical absorption capacity),  and anti-inflammatory (inhibition of interleukin-8 release by tumor necrosis factor-alpha-stimulated ht-29 cells) activities as well as their ability to adhere to intestinal (caco-2) and gastric (ags) epithelial cells. results obtained were compared with three commercial probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. plantarum 299v, and l. johnsonii ncc533. the five strains most efficient according to these activities were subsequently identified by sequencing their 16s rrna gene, their susceptibility to antibiotics was determined, and their safety evaluated in mice. one strain of l. plantarum was discarded due to the higher prevalence of liver bacterial translocation observed in the animals fed this strain. in conclusion, four autochthonous strains of l. rhamnosus were finally selected with probiotic properties and safety allowing their eventual use in human studies. these results contribute to increase the diversity of probiotic strains available for the development of nutraceuticals and functional foods.

TI  == molecular analysis and clinical significance of lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  == lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. we determined the genotypic identification of >100 lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) cfu/ml from urine). this study assessed the clinical  significance and the frequency of occurrence of each lactobacillus sp. we identified 16 species of lactobacillus by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, 10 of  which could not be associated with disease. while lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus gasseri, and lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, l. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus delbrueckii were  associated with at least one infection. species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., l. rhamnosus and l. casei) were identical, by 16s rrna gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. human isolates of lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.

TI  == probiotics in the management of inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review of intervention studies in adult patients.
AB  == introduction: mounting evidence suggests an important role for the intestinal microbiota in the chronic mucosal inflammation that occurs in inflammatory bowel  disease (ibd), and novel molecular approaches have further identified a dysbiosis in these patients. several mechanisms of action of probiotic products that may interfere with possible aetiological factors in ibd have been postulated. objective: our objective was to discuss the rationale for probiotics in ibd and to systematically review clinical intervention studies with probiotics in the management of ibd in adults. methods: a systematic search was performed in pubmed up to 1 october 2011, using defined keywords. only full-text papers in the english language addressing clinical outcomes in adult patients were included. the 41 eligible studies were categorized on disease type (ulcerative colitis [uc] with/without an ileo-anal pouch and crohn's disease [cd]) and disease activity. pooled odds ratios were only calculated per probiotic for a specific patient group when more than one randomized controlled trial was available. results: well designed randomized controlled trials supporting the application of probiotics in the management of ibd are still limited. meta-analyses could only be performed for a limited number of studies revealing overall risk ratios of 2.70 (95% ci 0.47, 15.33) for inducing remission in active uc with bifido-fermented milk versus placebo or no additive treatment (n = 2); 1.88 (95% ci 0.96, 3.67) for inducing remission in active uc with vsl#3 versus placebo (n = 2); 1.08 (95% ci 0.86, 1.37) for preventing relapses in inactive uc with escherichia coli nissle 1917 versus standard treatment (n = 3); 0.17 (95% ci 0.09, 0.33) for preventing relapses in inactive uc/ileo-anal pouch anastomosis (ipaa) patients with vsl#3 versus placebo; 1.21 (95% ci 0.57, 2.57) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive cd with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg versus placebo (n = 2); and 0.93 (95% ci 0.63, 1.38) for preventing endoscopic recurrences in inactive cd with lactobacillus johnsonii versus placebo (n = 2). conclusion: further well designed studies based on intention-to-treat analyses by several independent research groups are still warranted to support the promising results for e. coli nissle in inactive uc and the multispecies product vsl#3 in active uc and inactive pouch patients. so far, no evidence is available to support the use of probiotics in cd. future studies should focus on specific disease subtypes and disease location. further insight into the aetiology of ibd and the mechanisms of probiotic strains will aid in selecting probiotic strains for specific disease entities and disease locations.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == ai-2 signalling is induced by acidic shock in probiotic strains of lactobacillus  spp.
AB  == survival and ability to respond to various environmental stresses such as low ph  are important factors for lactobacilli for their function as probiotics. luxs-mediated quorum sensing mechanism, which is based on the production of universal signal molecule called autoinducer-2 (ai-2), regulates important physiological traits and a variety of adaptive processes in different bacteria. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acidic stress on luxs-mediated quorum sensing (ai-2 signalling) in four probiotic strains of different lactobacillus species. initially, the production of ai-2-like molecule  was investigated in four strains of lactobacillus spp. at standard growth conditions using vibrio harveyi bioluminescence assay. species variation in ai-2  activity was observed. ai-2 activity started at early-exponential growth phase and increased during the mid-exponential phase concomitant with the reduction of  ph, reaching maximum at late exponential phase (l. rhamnosus gg) or at stationary phase (l. salivarius ucc118, l. acidophilus ncfm and l. johnsonii ncc533). acidic shock experiments were conducted on l. rhamnosus gg and l. acidophilus ncfm after exposure to different acidic shocks (ph 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0) and to ph 6.5 as control, measuring ai-2 activity and transcription of the luxs gene. ai-2 activity increased by lowering the ph in a dose dependent manner and was negatively influenced by acid adaptation. in both species, the luxs gene was repressed after exposure to ph 6.5 as control. however, after acidic shock (ph 4.0) a transient response of luxs gene was observed and the transcription augmented over time, reaching a maximum level and decreased subsequently. acid adaptation of cells attenuated the transcription of this gene. based on the observations done in the present study, the luxs gene appears to have a clear role in acidic stress response in probiotic lactobacilli. this might be important in the survival of these bacteria during the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, and further influence the cell-to-cell communication among bacteria in the intestinal microbiota.

TI  == enhancement of survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid bacteria by yeasts in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions.
AB  == the effects of yeasts on the survival of probiotic and non-probiotic lactic acid  bacteria (lab) were studied in fermented milk under non-refrigerated conditions (30 degrees c) with a view to develop ambient-stable fermented milk with live lab. five yeasts tested (saccharomyces bayanus, williopsis saturnus var. saturnus, yarrowia lipolytica, candida kefyr and kluyveromyces marxianus) enhanced the survival of lactobacillus bulgaricus (but not streptococcus thermophilus) in a mixed yoghurt culture in yoghurt by approximately 10(2) to 10(5)-fold. seven yeasts examined (candida krusei, geotrichum candidum, pichia subpelliculosa, kloeckera apiculata, pichia membranifaciens, schizosaccharomyces  pombe and y. lipolytica) improved the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus in fermented milk by approximately10(3) to 10(6)-fold. w. saturnus var. saturnus enhanced the survival of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. rhamnosus (probiotic) and  lactobacillus reuteri by up to 10(6)-fold, but the same yeast failed to improve the survival of lactobacillus johnsonii (probiotic), s. thermophilus and l. bulgaricus in fermented milk. these results provide definitive evidence that yeasts possess stability-enhancing effects on lab and that the specific effects of yeasts on lab stability vary with yeasts as well as with lab. however, the molecular mechanism of such interaction of yeasts with lab remains to be found.

TI  == spr1630 is responsible for the lethality of clpx mutations in streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == the clp protease atpase subunit and chaperone clpx is dispensable in some bacteria, but it is thought to be essential in others, including streptococci and lactococci. we confirm that clpx is essential in the rx strain of streptococcus pneumoniae but show that the requirement for clpx can be relieved by point mutations, frame shifts, or deletion of the gene spr1630, which is found in many  isolates of s. pneumoniae. homologs occur frequently in staphylococcus aureus as  well as in a few strains of listeria monocytogenes, lactobacillus johnsonii, and  lactobacillus rhamnosus. in each case, the spr1630 homolog is accompanied by a putative transcriptional regulator with an hth dna binding motif. in s. pneumoniae, the spr1630-spr1629 gene pair, accompanied by a rup element, occurs as an island inserted between the trpa and ccla genes in 15 of 22 sequenced genomes.

TI  == meta-analysis: the effect and adverse events of lactobacilli versus placebo in maintenance therapy for crohn disease.
AB  == background: lactobacilli are used in an attempt to maintain remission for crohn disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and adverse events of lactobacilli compared with placebo in maintenance therapy for crohn disease. methods: we searched medline, embase, the cochrane controlled trials register, ovid and biosis. all randomized trials comparing lactobacilli with placebo in maintenance therapy for crohn disease were included. results: six randomized controlled trials with a total of 359 participants met the inclusion criteria. from the meta-analyses, the relative risk (rr) of clinical relapse rate was 1.15  (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.90-1.48) comparing lactobacilli with placebo and  rr of endoscopic relapse rate was 1.31 (95%ci 0.57-3.00). subgroup analyses showed rr for clinical relapse rates of lactobacilli versus placebo was 0.99 (95%ci 0.76-1.29) in adults, 1.85 (95%ci 1.00-3.41) in children, 1.68 (95%ci 1.07-2.64) in lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg and 0.91 (95%ci 0.68-1.23) in lactobacillus johnsonii respectively. the pooled rr of adverse events was 0.83 (95%ci 0.61-1.12). conclusion: our meta-analysis suggests that compared with placebo, administration of l. rhamnosus strain gg as maintenance therapy may increase the relapse rates of crohn disease. l. johnsonii is inefficacious in reducing the incidence of relapse.

TI  == identification of probiotic lactobacilli used for animal feeds on the basis of 16s ribosomal rna gene sequence.
AB  == the use of probiotics such as lactobacillus in animal feeds has gained popularity in recent years. in this study the 16s rrna gene sequence of l. acidophilus in two commercial agents which have been used in animal feeds, lab-mos and ghenisson 22, was determined. phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the two agents, strain mnflm01 in lab-mos and strain gal-2 in ghenisson 22, belonged to l. rhamnosus (a member of the l. casei group) and l. johnsonii (a member of the l. acidophilus group), respectively. biochemical tests assigned the two as l. rhamnosus and ambiguously as l. acidophilus. the data suggest that 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis provides more accurate identification of lactobacillus species  than biochemical tests and would allow quality assurance of relevant commercial products. the 16s rrna gene sequences of strains mnflm01 and gal-2 determined in  this study have been submitted to the ddbj/embl/genbank accession numbers under accession numbers ab288235 and ab295648, respectively.

AB  == adhesion of enterococcus mundtii st4sa and lactobacillus plantarum 423 to caco-2  (human carcinoma epithelial) cells was visualized by fluorescent staining. both strains showed good adhesion compared to l. casei mb1, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1 and l. rhamnosus gg. no correlation was found between hydrophobicity, aggregation and adhesion to caco-2 cells. presence of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicaments reduced adhesion of bacterial strains to caco-2 cells. proteins sensitive to pepsin, trypsin and pronase are involved in the adhesion of e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423 to caco-2 cells. adhesion of listeria monocytogenes scotta to caco-2 cells was not prevented by e. mundtii st4sa and l. plantarum 423. cell-free culture supernatants of strains st4sa and 423, containing the antimicrobial peptides plantaricin 423 and peptide st4sa, prevented the invasion of l. monocytogenes scotta into caco-2 cells.

TI  == single bioreactor gastrointestinal tract simulator for study of survival of probiotic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to design an in vitro model system to evaluate the probiotic potential of food. a single bioreactor system-gastrointestinal tract simulator (gits) was chosen for process simulation on account of its considerable simplicity compared to multi-vessel systems used in previous studies. the bioreactor was evaluated by studying the viability of four known probiotic bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, lactobacillus johnsonii ncc 533, lactobacillus casei strain shirota, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg) as a function of their physiological state. l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii survived in gits better when introduced at an early stationary or exponential phase compared to being previously stored for 2 weeks at 4 degrees c. these two species were more resistant to bile salts and survived better than l. casei and l. rhamnosus gg. the latter two species gave large losses (up to 6 log) in plate counts independent of growth state due to the bile. however, experiments with some commercial probiotic products containing lb. gg bacteria showed much better  survival compared with model food (modified deman-rogosa-sharpe growth medium), thus demonstrating the influence of the food matrix on the viability of bacteria. the study demonstrated that gits can be successfully used for evaluation of viability of probiotic bacteria and functionality of probiotic food.

TI  == fecal microflora of greek healthy neonates.
AB  == this study aimed to explore, in our geographical region, the development of intestinal microflora and the colonization patterns of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria during the first three months of life and to investigate the effect of the mode of delivery. fecal specimens from 82 healthy, full-term infants were collected prospectively 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery and subcultured on nonselective and selective media. identification of isolates was performed by microbiological and molecular methods. for the delivery effect, two  groups of vaginally or caesarean-delivered exclusively breast-fed infants were studied. despite the early high total counts of aerobes and anaerobes, colonization of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria was overall limited until 3 months of age. furthermore, caesarean-delivered infants were less often colonized with lactobacilli at day 4 (4% vs. 59%, p = 0.000) and with bifidobacteria at day 4 (0% vs. 23%, p = 0.015) and 30 (0% vs. 35%, p = 0.042) compared to vaginally delivered ones. no bacterial populations differences were detected to compare colonized infants. identification results indicated the predominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus johnsonii and lactobacillus paracasei species in neonatal gut microflora up to the first month of life and diversity of lactobacillus species in vaginally delivered, colonized newborns, at fourth day.  furthermore, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium breve were the most frequently detected bifidobacterium species in vaginally delivered, breast-fed infants. in conclusion our study revealed a restricted colonization pattern of lactic acid bacteria in greek infants and a delay in the development of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium spp. microbiota after caesarean section. further analysis of potential consequences of these findings is required.

TI  == the lactobacillus plantarum strain aca-dc287 isolated from a greek cheese demonstrates antagonistic activity in vitro and in vivo against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of  the xynotyri cheese isolate lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc287 using a set of in vitro and in vivo assays. methods and results: the co-culture of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl1344 results in the killing of the pathogen. the killing activity was produced mainly  by non-lactic acid molecule(s) that were present in the cell-free culture supernatant of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287. the culture of the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 inhibited the penetration of s. typhimurium sl1344 into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. in conventional mice infected with s. typhimurium sl1344, the intake of l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 results in a decrease in the levels of salmonella associated with intestinal tissues or those  present in the intestinal contents. in germ-free mice, the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 colonized the gastrointestinal tract. conclusions: the l. plantarum strain aca-dc287 strain exerts anti-salmonella activity similar that of the established probiotic strains lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029 and lactobacillus johnsonii la1. significance and impact of the study: the observation that a selected cheese lactobacillus strain exerted antibacterial activity that was similar to those of probiotic lactobacillus strains, is of interest for the use of this strain as an adjunct strain for the production of health-giving cheeses.

AB  == soy beverage and cows' milk yogurts were produced with steptococcus thermophilus  (atcc 4356) and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (im 025). the drop in ph during fermentation was faster in the soy beverage than in cows' milk, but the final ph values were similar. yogurts were prepared with a yogurt starter in conjunction with either the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus johnsonii ncc533 (la-1), lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103 (gg) or human derived bifidobacteria.  the presence of the probiotic bacteria did not affect the growth of the yogurt strains. approximately 2 log increases in both l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii la-1 were observed when each was added with the yogurt strains in both cows' milk and the soy beverage. two of the five bifidobacteria strains grew well in the cows' milk and soy beverage during fermentation with the yogurt bacteria. high pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) analyses showed that the probiotic bacteria and the bifidobacteria were using different sugars to support their growth, depending on whether the bacteria were growing in cows' milk or soy beverage.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == the effect of calcium ions on adhesion and competitive exclusion of lactobacillus ssp. and e. coli o138.
AB  == the adhesion abilities of 11 strains of lactobacillus were determined in vitro using the ipec-j2 cell line as a model system. bacteria cultures included the probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gg, l. reuteri atcc 55730, l. johnsonii ncc 533 and l. reuteri dsm 12246, and new isolates of lactobacillus ssp. adhesion was quantified by scintillation counting of radiolabelled bound bacteria. the highest adhesion of 38%, was determined for l. reuteri dsm 12246 followed by l. plantarum q47 with an adhesion level of 24%. other strains showed moderate to low binding of less than 16%. competitive adhesion experiments on ipec-j2 cells demonstrated  that strongly adhesive strains, as l. reuteri dsm 12246 and l. plantarum q47, significantly reduced the attachment of the less adhesive strains, such as l. rhamnosus gg and l. johnsonii ncc 533, both under condition of co-incubation and  in displacement assays, indicating that bacteria may share the same binding sites for attachment to intestinal cells. furthermore, it was revealed that calcium ions significantly increased the binding of tested lactobacilli to ipec-j2 cells; and therefore, added calcium may be useful in enhancing the adhesion of normally  weakly adhesive probiotic cultures. in contrast, no significant change in adhesion of lactobacilli was observed in the presence of mg and zn ions. displacement assays performed with pathogenic e. coli o138 showed that all tested lactobacillus strains reduced the attachment of e. coli o138 to ipec-j2 by more than 2-fold both in the presence and the absence of calcium ions. the strains of  lactobacillus did not differ significantly in the extent of their inhibition of e. coli o138 adhesion, indicating that the reduced adhesion of e. coli o138 was due to steric hindrance of the binding sites rather than to specific interactions.

TI  == kinetic analysis of the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacilli towards  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium reveals a role for lactic acid and other  inhibitory compounds.
AB  == six lactobacillus strains including commercial probiotic ones (l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota, l. johnsonii la1, l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and l. rhamnosus gg) were investigated, through batch fermentations under controlled conditions, for their capacity to inhibit salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344. all lactobacilli displayed strong antibacterial activity toward this gram-negative pathogen and significantly inhibited invasion  of the pathogen into cultured human enterocyte-like caco-2/tc7 cells. by studying the production kinetics of antibacterial activity and applying the appropriate acid and ph control samples during a killing assay, we were able to distinguish between the effect of lactic acid and other inhibitory compounds produced. the antibacterial activity of l. acidophilus ibb 801, l. amylovorus dce 471, l. casei shirota and l. rhamnosus gg was solely due to the production of lactic acid. the  antibacterial activity of l. johnsonii la1 and l. plantarum aca-dc 287 was due to the production of lactic acid and (an) unknown inhibitory substance(s). the latter was (were) only active in the presence of lactic acid. in addition, the lactic acid produced was responsible for significant inhibitory activity upon invasion of salmonella into caco-2/tc7 cells.

TI  == ph-, lactic acid-, and non-lactic acid-dependent activities of probiotic lactobacilli against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == the mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering of the ph and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial compounds, including bacteriocins  and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid molecules. addition of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic acid. we found that the probiotic strains lactobacillus johnsonii la1, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus casei shirota yit9029, l. casei dn-114 001, and l. rhamnosus gr1 induced a dramatic decrease in the viability of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 mainly attributable to non-lactic acid molecule(s) present in the cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs). these molecules were more active against serovar typhimurium sl1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the stationary growth phase. we also showed  that the production of the non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable substances with killing activity were present in the cfcss. we found that  the complete inhibition of serovar typhimurium sl1344 growth results from a ph-lowering effect.

TI  == a dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study of probiotics.
AB  == a dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (gi) tract was designed to better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as part of the model design. the dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 37 degrees c, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum conditions. the model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from humans (bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (bifidobacterium  animalis, 2 strains), and fermented dairy products (bifidobacterium longum, lactobacillus kefir, lactobacillus kefirgranum, and leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by conventional methods. five strains were not  able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 min in a medium acidified at ph 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. two strains (bifidobacterium animalis atcc 25527 and lactobacillus johnsonii la-1 ncc 533) showed good survival with both methods. the dynamic model was shown to better represent the events during upper gi tract  transit than the conventional methods, by incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose bacteria to ph levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

TI  == molecular quantification of lactic acid bacteria in fermented milk products using real-time quantitative pcr.
AB  == real-time quantitative pcr assays were developed for the absolute quantification  of lactic acid bacteria (lab) (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus, l. acidophilus and l. johnsonii) in fermented milk products. the results of molecular quantification and classic bacterial enumeration did not differ significantly with respect to s. thermophilus and the species of the l. casei group which were detected in the six commercial fermented products tested, thus showing that dna extraction was efficient and that genomic dna solutions were free of pcr inhibitors. for l. delbrueckii, the results of bacterial enumeration were generally lower by a factor 10 to 100 than those of pcr quantification, suggesting a loss of viability during storage of the dairy products at 1-8 degrees c for most of the strains in  this species. real-time quantitative assays enabled identification of the species of lactic acid bacterial strains initially present in commercial fermented milk products and their accurate quantification with a detection threshold of 10(3) cells per ml of product.

TI  == molecular analysis of the microflora associated with dental caries.
AB  == molecular techniques have revealed many novel, presumed unculturable, taxa in oral infections. the aim of this study was to characterize the bacterial community of the middle and advancing front of carious dental lesions by cultural and molecular analyses. samples were collected with a hand excavator from five teeth with carious lesions involving dentine. samples were cultured on blood agar and rogosa agar incubated in air plus 5% co(2) and on fastidious anaerobe agar anaerobically. dna was also extracted directly from the samples and 16s rrna genes were amplified by pcr with universal primers. pcr products were singularized by cloning, and the cloned inserts and cultured isolates were identified by 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. we identified 95 taxa among the 496 isolates and 1,577 clones sequenced; 44 taxa were detected by the molecular method alone; 31 taxa were previously undescribed. only three taxa, streptococcus mutans, rothia dentocariosa, and an unnamed propionibacterium sp., were found in  all five samples. the predominant taxa by anaerobic cultivation were the novel propionibacterium sp. (18%), olsenella profusa (14%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). the predominant taxa in the molecular analysis were streptococcus mutans (16%), lactobacillus gasseri/johnsonii (13%), and lactobacillus rhamnosus (8%). there was no significant difference between the compositions of the microflora in the middle and advancing front samples (p < 0.05, wilcoxon matched pairs, signed  ranks test). in conclusion, combined cultural and molecular analyses have shown that a diverse bacterial community is found in dentinal caries and that numerous  novel taxa are present.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.

TI  == characterization of the properties of human- and dairy-derived probiotics for prevention of infectious diseases in fish.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the potential probiotic properties of six  lactic acid bacteria (lab) intended for human use, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. rhamnosus lc 705, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and lactobacillus johnsonii la1, and one for animal use, enterococcus faecium tehobak, for use as a fish probiotic. the strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human  consumption. the selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. the adhesion abilities of the seven lab and three fish pathogens, vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida, and flavobacterium psychrophilum, were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface  or in the gut of rainbow trout. five of the tested lab strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). despite their adhesive character, the lab strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of a. salmonicida. coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of a. salmonicida, which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. all lab except l. casei shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.

TI  == the effect of probiotic bacteria on the adhesion of pathogens to human intestinal mucus.
AB  == human intestinal glycoproteins extracted from faeces were used as a model for intestinal mucus to investigate adhesion of pathogenic escherichia coli and salmonella strains, and the effect of probiotics on this adhesion. s-fimbriated e. coli expressed relatively high adhesion in the mucus model, but the other tested pathogens adhered less effectively. probiotic strains lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus lc-705 as well as a l. rhamnosus isolated from human faeces were able to slightly reduce s-fimbria-mediated adhesion. adhesion of s. typhimurium was significantly inhibited by probiotic l. johnsonii lj1 and l. casei shirota. lactobacillus gg and l. rhamnosus (human isolate) increased the adhesion of s. typhimurium suggesting that the pathogen interacts with the probiotic.

TI  == isolation and identification of lactobacilli from novel-type probiotic and mild yoghurts and their stability during refrigerated storage.
AB  == a total of 26 lactobacillus strains were isolated from various mild yoghurts and  novel-type probiotic dairy products and from a starter culture preparation and were identified by using dna-dna hybridization technique. the species present in  those products were found to be lactobacillus acidophilus, l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus. dna homology analysis revealed that some strains had been misclassified by their investigators. three strains designated as l. acidophilus (l. acidophilus la-1, l. acidophilus atcc 43121 and the lactobacillus strain from biogarde culture) were found to belong to l. johnsonii and l. acidophilus l1 to be l. crispatus. strains designated as l. casei were found to be members of three separate species: l. casei, l. paracasei  and l. rhamnosus. viable numbers of lactobacilli in mild and probiotic yoghurts varied greatly including some products with very low lactobacillus counts. the majority of the probiotic yoghurts, however, contained viable counts above 10(5)  per g even at the end of the best before use period.
