TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
