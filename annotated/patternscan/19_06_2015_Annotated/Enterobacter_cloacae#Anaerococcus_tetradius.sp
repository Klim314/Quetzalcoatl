TI  == [characteristics of war wound infection].
AB  == war wounds are the most complex type of non-targeted injuries due to uncontrolled tissue damage of varied and multifold localizations, exposing sterile body areas  to contamination with a huge amount of bacteria. wound contamination is caused by both the host microflora and exogenous agents from the environment (bullets, cloth fragments, dust, dirt, water) due to destruction of the host protective barriers. war wounds are the consequence of destructive effects of various types  of projectiles, which result in massive tissue devitalization, hematomas, and compromised circulation with tissue ischemia or anoxia. this environment is highly favorable for proliferation of bacteria and their invasion in the surrounding tissue over a relatively short period of time. war wounds are associated with a high risk of local and systemic infection. the infection will develop unless a timely combined treatment is undertaken, including surgical intervention within 6 hours of wounding and antibiotic therapy administered immediately or at latest in 3 hours of wound infliction. time is a crucial factor in this type of targeted combined treatment consisting of surgical debridement, appropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy, and specific antitetanic prophylaxis. apart from exposure factors, there are a number of predisposing factors that favor the development of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection.  these are shock, pain, blood loss, hypoxia, hematomas, type and amount of traumatized tissue, age, and comorbidity factors in the wounded. the determinants that define the spectrum of etiologic agents in contaminated war wounds are: wound type, body region involved, time interval between wounding and primary surgical treatment, climate factors, season, geographical area, hygienic conditions, and patient habits. the etiologic agents of infection include gram-positive aerobic cocci, i. e. staphylococcus spp, streptococcus spp and enterococcus spp, which belong to the physiological flora of the human skin and mucosa; gram-negative facultative aerobic rods; members of the family enterobacteriacea (escherichia coil, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae), which predominate in the physiological flora of the intestines, transitory flora of the skin and environment; gram-negative bacteria, i. e. pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter calcoaceticus -  a. baumanii complex; environmental bacteria associated with humid environment and dust; anaerobic gram-positive sporogeneous rods clostridium spp, gram-negative asporogeneous rods bacteroides spp and gram-positive anaerobic cocci; peptostreptococcus spp and peptococcus spp. the latter usually colonize the intestine, primarily the colon, and the skin, while clostridium spores are also found in the environment. early empirical antibiotic therapy is used instead of standard antibiotic prophylaxis. empirical antimicrobial therapy is administered  to prevent the development of systemic infection, gas gangrene, necrotizing infection of soft tissue, intoxication and death. the choice of antibiotics is determined by the presumed infective agents and localization of the wound. it is  used in all types of war wounds over 5-7-10 days. the characteristics of antibiotics used in war wounds are the following: broad spectrum of activity, ability to penetrate deep into the tissue, low toxicity, long half-life, easy storage and application, and cost effectiveness. the use of antibiotics is not a  substitution for surgical treatment. the expected incidence of infection, according to literature data, is 35%-40%. if the time elapsed until surgical debridement exceeds 12 hours, or the administration of antibiotics exceeds 6 hours of wound infliction, primary infection of the war wound occurs (early infection) in more than 50% of cases. the keys for the prevention of infection are prompt and thorough surgical exploration of the wound, administration of antibiotics and antitetanic prophylaxis, awareness of the probable pathogens with respect to localization of the wound, and optimal choice of antibiotics and length of their administration.

TI  == [nationwide surveillance of parenteral antibiotics containing meropenem activities against clinically isolated strains in 2004].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem (mepm) and other parenteral antibiotics against clinical isolates of 907 strains of gram-positive bacteria, 1790 strains  of gram-negative bacteria, and 192 strains of anaerobic bacteria obtained from 30 medical institutions during 2004 was measured. the results were as follows; 1. mic90 of mepm for almost all of enterobacteriaceae and haemophilus influenzae were 4-fold to 32-fold lower than those of other carbapenems. mepm was more active than other carbapenem antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria, especially against enterobacteriaceae and h. influenzae. mepm were active against most of the species tested in gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria, except for multi-drug resistant strains including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. 2. as for pseudomonas aeruginosa, imipenem (ipm) showed high cross-resistant rate againt meropenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (87.9%). mepm showed low cross-resistant rate both againt ipm-resistant p. aeruginosa (49.2%) and ciprofloxacin-resistant p. aeruginosa (38.0%). 3. the proportion of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) strains was 3.1% (4 strains) in escherichia coli, 8.0% (2 strains) in citrobacter koseri, 2.5% (3 strains) in klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% (2 strains) in enterobacter cloacae, 0.9% (1 strains) in serratia marcescens, and 2.2% (2 strains) in proteus mirabilis. the proportion of metallo-beta-lactamase strains was 1.6% (5 strains) in p. aeruginosa. 4. of all species tested, peptostreptococcus spp. was the only species, which mic90 of  mepm was more than 4-fold higher than that in our previous study using clinical isolates during 2002 (0.25 microg/ml --> 1 microg/ml). therefore, there is almost no siginificant decrease in susceptibility of clinical isolates to meropenem. in  conclusion, the results from this surveillance study suggest that mepm retains its potent and broad antibacterial activity and therefore is a clinically useful  carbapenem at present, 9 years after available for commercial use.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between april 1998  and march 1999].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained in fiscal 1998 (from april 1998 to march 1999). the number of cases investigated as objectives was 225 for one year. a total of 429 strains (121 strains from primary infections and 308 strains from postoperative infections) were isolated from 183 cases (81.3% of total cases). in primary infections, the isolation rates of anaerobes and escherichia coli were higher than in postoperative infections, while in postoperative infections, those of gram-positive aerobes and pseudomonas aeruginosa were higher than in primary infections. on the whole, among gram-positive aerobes, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by staphylococcus aureus with high frequency in isolation from  postoperative infections. among gram-positive anaerobes, peptostreptococcus spp.  and streptococcus spp. were predominantly isolated. among gram-negative aerobes,  e. coli, p. aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae were frequently isolated. among gram-negative anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates. in primary infections, the percentage of gram-negative aerobes has gradually increased since fiscal 1995 or 1996 with these years as the turning point, while those of gram-positive and gram-negative  anaerobes have gradually declined. in postoperative infections, the percentage of gram-negative anaerobes has increased continuously since the mid-1980s. the percentage of mrsa among s. aureus rose to 89.7%, which was the highest level since the beginning of this study. the susceptibilities of b. fragilis, which did not show apparent changes, were recognized to have decreased against cephems in fiscal 1998. among other bacteria in b. fragilis group, development of resistance to cephems has continued on a long-term basis since the mid-1980s. e. coli and k. pneuminiae have obviously not changed in susceptibilities, however, the susceptibilities of isolated strains in fiscal 1998 against high-generation cephems, oxacephems and monobactams have declined. we found neither vancomycin-resistant nor teicoplanin-resistant strains of s. aureus and enterococcus spp.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  == meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position c1  which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (dhp-1),  thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in c2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the pbps. it covers gram positive aerobes (staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, enterococcus faecalis, rhodococcus equi, listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter, aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria, moraxella) and anaerobes  (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, clostridium, peptostreptococcus, and propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: p. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and h. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci,  streptococci and staphylococci). meropenem has no activity on enterococcus faecium, s. aureus resistant to methycillin, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the oprd porin (oprd2 in enterobacteria and p. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the pbps (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).

TI  == subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the dominican republic.
AB  == a study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in santo domingo, dominican republic. paper point sampling, transport in vmga iii, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. nonselective culturing showed gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in  10 patients. parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the usa. in conclusion, fewer  spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in santo domingo patients compared to those in usa. high levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in santo domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against fresh clinical isolates from superficial suppurative foci].
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 5 drugs (ciprofloxacin (cpfx), and 4 drugs used as standard) were determined to investigate antibacterial potencies of cpfx against bacterial strains isolated in 1989 from superficial suppurative foci. the clinical isolates tested included 375 strains from 11 aerobic bacterial species, and 50 strains from 2 anerobic bacterial genera (group) for a total of 425 isolates. interpreting mic level distributions of these drugs as the expression of antibacterial potencies, the results are as follows. 1. when activities of new-quinolone antibiotics were tested, we found that, cpfx expressed far superior antibacterial potency to ofloxacin (oflx) and norfloxacin (nflx) against coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and peptostreptococcus spp., although the activity of cpfx against bacteroides fragilis group was weaker than that of oflx, and cpfx had similar activity against staphylococcus aureus to oflx. 2. in comparison to beta-lactam antibiotics, cpfx was inferior to amoxicillin (ampc) against e. faecalis and inferior to ampc and cefaclor (ccl) against peptostreptococcus spp.  against all other bacterial species, however, cpfx expressed superior antibacterial potency to ampc and ccl. 3. scattered findings of low sensitivity or resistance to cpfx were observed among the s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. faecium, p. vulgaris, m. morganii, p. aeruginosa and b. fragilis (group) species, but with an exception of e. faecium, the incidence of resistance strains was low.

TI  == use of intravenous ciprofloxacin in difficult-to-treat infections.
AB  == intravenous ciprofloxacin was administered to 54 patients who were either critically ill or in whom oral administration was not possible. the 31 males and  23 females ranged in age from 20 to 89 years (mean, 53.2 +/- 17.8 years). patients had "difficult-to-treat" infections, i.e., respiratory infections (15),  abscesses (four intraabdominal, three lung, two soft tissue, and one intrahepatic), deep soft tissue infections (10), chronic post-traumatic osteomyelitis in exacerbation (nine), upper urinary tract infection (five), malignant external otitis (two), catheter-related bacteremia (two), and infectious endocarditis (one). thirty patients (56 percent) had serious associated medical problems. pathogens included pseudomonas aeruginosa (38 isolates), acinetobacter species (10 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (eight isolates), escherichia coli (two isolates), proteus mirabilis (one isolate), kingella kingae (one isolate), bacteroides fragilis (eight isolates), and peptostreptococcus species (five isolates). minimal inhibitory concentrations of  ciprofloxacin ranged from 0.003 to 2 micrograms/ml. in 39 patients, the isolated  microorganisms were multi-resistant; resistance included ceftazidime and amikacin in 32 patients. in 24 patients, ciprofloxacin was given exclusively by the intravenous route at a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours; in 30 patients, treatment was completed after discontinuation of the parenteral drug with the oral preparation of ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours. the duration of  parenteral treatment ranged from six to 40 days (mean, 14.9 days). a successful clinical response was observed in 49 patients (91 percent), while five (9 percent) failed to show a response. bacteriologic outcomes were as follows: eradication of pathogen in 33 patients (61.1 percent), persistence in 18 (33.3 percent), and relapse in three (5.6 percent), with development of resistance to ciprofloxacin in nine patients (16.7 percent) and superinfection in two patients  (3.7 percent). side effects included vein irritation at the site of the infusion  (three patients), abnormal elevation in liver enzyme levels (two patients), reversible renal failure (one patient), and nausea (one patient). parenteral ciprofloxacin is a safe, well-tolerated, and effective therapy for the critically ill patient, and can be replaced with the oral form when clinically appropriate.

TI  == cefamandole therapy in hand infections.
AB  == hand lacerations, especially when inadequately treated, may result in infections  caused by aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic infections most commonly result from human bite injuries in which there is contact between hand and mouth. the search continues for an ideal antibiotic to employ when anaerobic organisms are suspected. in this study cefamandole, a new cephalosporin antibiotic, was employed whenever anaerobic hand infections were suspected following trauma. in each patient quantitative cultures for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms were  obtained. all organisms isolated were tested by standard susceptibility assays for both aerobes and anaerobes. in the case of anaerobes, minimum inhibitory concentration assays were also performed. after the initial culture was obtained, each patient received approximately 1.5 gm of cefamandole every 6 hours for a period of 5 days. this therapy was changed only if susceptibility studies indicated resistance to cefamandole. in our patients, 58% of the infectious organisms were aerobic and facultative anaerobic and 42% were obligate anaerobes. the predominant organisms isolated were staphylococcus aureus and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, which accounted for 42% of the infections. in most of the aerobic infections a single organism was isolated, whereas multiple organisms were identified in the anaerobic infections. all but one of the infections responded to cefamandole; the one that didn't was caused by enterobacter cloacae and required treatment with an aminoglycoside. because of its broad-spectrum coverage, which includes both aerobes and anaerobes, cefamandole is useful in treating infections, especially those resulting from human bites.
