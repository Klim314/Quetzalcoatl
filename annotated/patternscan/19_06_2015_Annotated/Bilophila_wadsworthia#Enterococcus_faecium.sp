TI  == maternal exposure to fish oil primes offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts associated with altered immune cell balance.
AB  == our previous studies revealed that offspring from rat dams fed fish oil (at 8% and 18% energy), developed impaired intestinal barriers sensitizing the colon to  exacerbated injury later in life. to discern the mechanism, we hypothesized that  in utero exposure to fish oil, rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (pufa), caused abnormal intestinal reparative responses to mucosal injury through differences in intestinal microbiota and the presence of naive immune cells. to identify such mechanisms, gut microbes and naive immune cells were compared between rat pups born to dams fed either n-6 pufa, n-3 pufa or breeder chow. maternal exposure to either of the pufa rich diets altered the development of the intestinal microbiota with an overall reduction in microbial density. using qpcr, we found that each type of pufa differentially altered the major gut phyla; fish  oil increased bacteroidetes and safflower oil increased firmicutes. both pufa diets reduced microbes known to dominate the infant gut like enterobacteriaceae and bifidobacteria spp. when compared to the chow group. uniquely, maternal fish  oil diets resulted in offspring showing blooms of opportunistic pathogens like bilophila wadsworthia, enterococcus faecium and bacteroides fragilis in their gut microbiota. as well, fish oil groups showed a reduction in colonic cd8+ t cells,  cd4+ foxp3+ t cells and arginase+ m2 macrophages. in conclusion, fish oil supplementation in pharmacological excess, at 18% by energy as shown in this study, provides an example where excess dosing in utero can prime offspring to harbor intestinal pathobionts and alter immune cell homeostasis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2010  and march 2011].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2010 to march 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. such as enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and enterococcus avium was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. such as streptococcus anginosus and staphylococcus spp. such as staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. such as e. faecalis  and e. faecium was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. such as s. aureus from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli and r aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by e. cloacae and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of parvimonas micra, eggerthella lenta, streptococcus constellatus, gemella morbillorum, and collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed.
