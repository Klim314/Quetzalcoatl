TI  == detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  == fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in norway and usa were screened for the presence of the bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(oxa), bla(ampc), bla(cfxa), and bla(cepa/cbla) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the pcr products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified dna. thirty-four of the  53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the pcr assays. all beta-lactamase-producing prevotella and capnocytophaga spp. were cfxa positive. tem-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of escherichia coli and neisseria sp., and one strain of citrobacter freundii possessed an ampc-type  beta-lactamase. screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. sequence analyses showed that most cfxa positive prevotella and capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the cfxa2 and cfxa3 enzyme. the present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  == objective: to study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. design: retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. setting: navy hospital in bethesda, md. results: sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). the predominant aerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), escherichia coli (n = 7), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and klebsiella sp (n =  3). the most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). propionibacterium acnes and peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; b fragilis and enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and s aureus and p aeruginosa and citrobacter sp, with burns. conclusion: these data illustrate the  importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
