TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == in-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  == background: owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. the essential oil of the thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional  medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. this essential oil  may also have an anticancer activity. methods: the essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by gc/ms analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by hplc method. the essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial  activity. result: the terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. in this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. the essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteridis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (mic). all the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. these activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. hplc confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. conclusion: methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. the technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using dpph, abts and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. the present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties  and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.

TI  == activity of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract against mrsa, mrcns, mssa, bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi.
AB  == temu kunci (kaempferia pandurata (roxb.)) has a number of benefits and one of these is antibacterial. the rhizome is said to have antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactocillus sp. and candida albicans. the aim of the study is to test the antibacterial activity of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) rhizome ethanol extract on methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-resistant coagulase negative staphylococci (mrcns), methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi. antimicrobial activity of the extract was assayed by the microdilution method using mueller hinton broth with sterilized 96 round-bottomed microwells to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) as well as to  determine the time-kill activity. the mic of the extract was 16 ppm for both bacillus subtilis and mrsa; 8 ppm for both mssa and salmonella typhi and 4 ppm for mrcns. ethanol extract of kaempferia pandurata (roxb.) showed antibacterial activity against all the tested bacteria and was the most potent against mrcns, with mic 4 ppm. the killing profile test of the extract displayed bactericidal activity at 8-16 ppm against mrsa, mssa, bacillus subtilis and salmonella typhi and bacteriostatic activity at 4 ppm towards mrcns.

TI  == tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  == binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. the present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are  isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. the results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. we hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. the alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. these findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of cichorium intybus root extract using  orthogonal matrix design.
AB  == solvent, impregnation time, sonication repetitions, and ultrasonic power were important factors in the process of ultrasound-assisted extraction from chicory (cichorium intybus) root, while there were no studies about optimizing these 4 factors for extract yield, total phenolic content (tpc), antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activity of the extracts using orthogonal matrix design. the present research demonstrated that the solvent composition played a significant role in the improving extract yield, tpc, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. the other 3 factors had inequable effect on different purposes, ultrasonic power could improve tpc and antioxidant activity, but long time of extraction lowered antioxidant activity. the tpc increased from 22.34 to  27.87 mg gae (gallic acid equivalents)/100 g (dry extracts) with increasing solvent polarity. the half inhibition concentration (ic(50,) mug/ml) of the radical scavenging activity of the chicory extracts ranged from 281.00 to 983.33  mug/ml. the content of caffeoylquinic acids of root extract, which was extracted  by the optimal combination was 0.104%. several extracts displayed antibacterial activities against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella typhi, while penicillium sp. and aspergillus sp. resisted against all the extracts. combination of 70% ethanol v/v, 24-h impregnation time, 3 sonication rounds, and 300-w ultrasonic input power was found to be the optimal combination for the chicory extract yield, tpc, antioxidant activity, and antibacterial activity.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-o-lauroyl ester.
AB  == aims: to determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (p), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-o-lauroyl ester (pl), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. methods  and results: p and its lauroyl ester were tested against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. p showed no inhibitory effect against  the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and  different bacilllus sp. however, 150 mug ml(-1) of pl inhibited escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, many bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus atcc29213, enterococcus avium dsmz17511, and different listeria monocytogenes strains. in the last case, l. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. a bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning  and transmission electronic microscopies. conclusions: pl could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. a bactericidal effect was also determined on l. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. p did not show any antimicrobial property at all. significance and impact of the study: pl is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-listeria property.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6.
AB  == biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. in two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6 formed  mixed biofilms with bacillus sp. strain 4j6 but was largely predominant over paracoccus sp. strain 4m6 and vibrio sp. strain d01. the supernatant of pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 liquid culture (sn(3j6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living paracoccus sp. 4m6 and vibrio sp. d01 cells, but it  impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. antibiofilm molecules of sn(3j6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial  attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect  but not the loss of cell viability. sn(3j6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all gram-negative marine strains tested except other pseudoalteromonas strains. biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3-  to 225-fold. interestingly, sn(3j6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli. such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  == lactobacillus spp., referred to as ij-1 and ij-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. according to the analyses of 16s rdna sequence, lactobacillus sp. ij-1 showed greater than 99% homology with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016(t), and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 had  greater than 99% homology with the l. gasseri atcc 33323(t) and l. johnsonii atcc 33200(t). the ph changes in the culture media of lactobacillus sp. ij-1 and lactobacillus sp. ij-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. both strains inhibited the growth of  pathogenic microorganisms, such as listeria monocytogenes atcc 19111, salmonella  enterica kctc 12401, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus kctc 3881, and bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.

TI  == photodynamic treatment: a novel method for sanitation of food handling and food processing surfaces.
AB  == the photodynamic bactericidal effect of the photoactive dyes acriflavine neutral, rose bengal, phloxine b, and malachite green (oxalate salt) at concentrations of  5 to 5,000 microg/ml against two gram-negative strains (escherichia coli ljh 128  and salmonella typhimurium c1058), two gram-positive strains (bacillus sp. c578 and listeria monocytogenes ljh 375), and yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae c1172) was investigated. incubation of the investigated bacteria with acriflavine neutral under illumination resulted in a significant reduction in cell numbers compared with dark incubation. rose bengal caused a significant killing effect for bacteria incubated both in the dark and under illumination. malachite green was active against gram-positive bacteria under illumination and did not affect gram-negative bacteria or yeasts. incubation with phloxine b resulted in a significant decline in cell numbers for gram-positive bacteria, both in the dark  and under illumination; gram-negative bacteria and yeasts were unaffected. conjugation of rose bengal and phloxine b with poly(vinyl amine) resulted in an enhanced bactericidal effect during both dark and light incubation. this was explained by electrostatic interaction of the polymer with the cell surface, which resulted in closer contact of the photoactive dye and cell. no killing effect was observed for yeasts incubated with dye conjugates. filter paper treated with dye-poly(vinyl amine) conjugates showed high photodynamic bactericidal activity against the bacterial strains, but not against the yeasts.  the extent of bacterial killing depended on the nature and concentration of the dye conjugate and the type of microorganism. the presented data suggest that a photodynamic approach for constructing "self-decontaminating" materials has potential.

TI  == bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances from campylobacter spp.
AB  == twenty-five campylobacter isolates were screened for production of antimicrobial  substances using a deferred antagonism assay. sixteen isolates showed activity against either staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis or  candida albicans. the inhibitory activity was sensitive to treatment with pronase e, trypsin and pepsin, suggesting that the antimicrobial compound(s) are proteinaceous. activity spectra of isolates included s. aureus, micrococcus luteus, streptococcus sp., bacillus subtilis, a drug-resistant clinical isolate of s. aureus and one isolate of c. albicans. producing isolates showed cross-immunity and inhibitory activity was only observed on solid media. the findings of this study suggest that campylobacter produces proteinaceous inhibitory substances.

TI  == distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.
