TI  == oral administration of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus partially alleviates tma-induced atopic dermatitis in mice through improving intestinal microbiota.
AB  == aims: the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of lactobacillus casei variety rhamnosus (lcr35) on atopic dermatitis (ad)-like symptoms in mice.  methods and results: ad-like skin lesions in balb/c mice were induced by sensitization and subsequent repeated challenges with trimellitic anhydride (tma) for 10 days. lcr35 was orally administered to the mice once daily throughout the  study. in the tma-induced ad model, orally administered lcr35 suppressed significantly irritant-related scratching behaviour and skin dehydration as well  as apparent severity of ad. lcr35 also significantly decreased serum levels of ige and il-4, but not ifn-gamma, implying the restoration of tma-induced disruption of th1/th2 balance. quantitative real-time pcr targeting hypervariable regions of 16s rdna gene of faecal microbiota indicated that the lcr35 treatment  increased the population of bifidobacterium, lactobacilli, enterococcus and bacteroides fragilis group, but decreased those of clostridium coccoides group. conclusions: lcr35 has the ability to suppress the development of ad in mice, possibly through the modulation of th1/th2 balance and gut microbiota. significance and impact of the study: lcr35 has a strong potential as a probiotic for preventing ad.

TI  == a pilot study on the effect of lactobacillus casei zhang on intestinal microbiota parameters in chinese subjects of different age.
AB  == ageing of the population is an imminent global problem. lactobacillus casei zhang (lcz) was isolated from inner mongolian fermented milk, koumiss. lcz possesses numerous probiotic properties in in vitro tests and in animal models. however, it has never been tested in any human trial. in the current study, the impact of oral consumption of lcz on different age groups was tested. chinese subjects, including 10 young, 7 middle-aged and 7 elderly volunteers (with mean age of 24.3, 47.6 and 64.7, respectively), were recruited. each subject took 10.6 log10  cfu lcz daily for a continuous period of 28 days. several parameters, including the amounts of lcz and four selected groups of bacteria, change of bacterial diversity, short chain fatty acids (scfa) and total bile acids (tba), were monitored in faecal samples collected from the subjects before starting, during and after stopping oral lcz consumption. the consumption of lcz exhibited beneficial effects to the subjects by modulating faecal microbiota in a temporal  manner with a prolonged elevation of scfa and reduction of tba. the potentially harmful pseudomonas and acinetobacter genera were suppressed by the probiotic administration. furthermore, a moderately divergent response was observed in the  indigenous gut populations of bifidobacterium and bacteroides fragilis group in different age subjects. taken together, the current study has provided proof on the positive effect of probiotic consumption and crucial insights into the design and application of probiotic-based products to users of different age segments.

TI  == probiotic lactobacillus casei zhang ameliorates high-fructose-induced impaired glucose tolerance in hyperinsulinemia rats.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic effects of lactobacilluscasei zhang on impaired glucose tolerance (igt) by using fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia rats. methods: rats were fed 25 % fructose solution for hyperinsulinemia with l.casei zhang for prevention or therapy. serum levels of insulin, glucagon-like peptide-2 (glp-2), osteocalcin, malondialdehyde (mda), total intestinal bile acids and hepatic glycogen contents were determined by assay kits. the major bacteria from feces and liver expression of adiponectin receptor 2 (adipor2), liver x receptor-alpha (lxr-alpha), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (ppar-gamma) and vitamin k epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 mrna were assessed by rt-pcr. pancreas injury was evaluated by histological analysis. results: lactobacilluscasei zhang significantly increased numbers of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium and decreased clostridium in the intestine (p < 0.01). meanwhile, liver glycogen contents were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). in preventive group, accompanied by significantly lower insulin and glp-2 levels (p < 0.05), l.casei zhang prevented rats from an increase in oral glucose tolerance area under curve  (auc) which was significant in hyperinsulinemia group (p < 0.05). in therapeutic  group, l.casei zhang administration possessed improved glucose tolerance (p < 0.05), which were associated with increased osteocalcin level (p < 0.01), improved intestinal bile acids secretion (p = 0.060), decreased serum mda levels  (p < 0.05) and upregulation of lxr-alpha, ppar-gamma and adipor2 gene expression, as well as an increase in bacteroides fragilis (p < 0.05). conclusions: lactobacilluscasei zhang administration exert both preventive and ameliorative effect on oral glucose tolerance auc in igt rats but may be via different mechanisms. l.casei zhang could prevent rats from increased auc through glp-2 lowering, while the ameliorative effect in high-fructose-fed post-adolescent rats may be via b. fragilis enriched vitamin k2-dependent osteocalcin mechanism in which adipor2, lxr-alpha and ppar-gamma signaling were involved.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using  1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus.  these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria  (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum  was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.

TI  == multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  == bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (mls) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 s ribosomal rna confers resistance to m, l, and s b-type (mlsb) antibiotics. investigation, by dna annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from streptococcus (groups a,b,d, and h, and pneumoniae), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus licheniformis, bacteroides fragilis, lactobacillus casei, and streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the mlsb resistance (r) determinants. a minimum of four distinct classes of mlsb r determinants could be defined: classes a and b for the gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class c for b. licheniformis, and class d for bact. fragilis. these data do not support the hypothesis that the r determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the gram-positive cocci. the genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards mlsb antibiotics. inactivation of the drug confers resistance  to m and/or l and/or s or sa or sb antibiotics and has been detected in strains of streptococcus, staph. aureus, lactobacillus, c. perfringens, streptomyces, and recently in the gram-negative organism escherichia coli. we have cloned and sequenced a dna fragment conferring high level resistance (mic greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. the distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. the gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of e. coli belonging to various biotypes, in klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic  in enterobacteria.

TI  == effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. the effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
