TI  == substrate-driven gene expression in roseburia inulinivorans: importance of inducible enzymes in the utilization of inulin and starch.
AB  == roseburia inulinivorans is a recently identified motile representative of the firmicutes that contributes to butyrate formation from a variety of dietary polysaccharide substrates in the human large intestine. microarray analysis was used here to investigate substrate-driven gene-expression changes in r. inulinivorans a2-194. a cluster of fructo-oligosaccharide/inulin utilization genes induced during growth on inulin included one encoding a beta-fructofuranosidase protein that was prominent in the proteome of inulin-grown cells. this cluster also included a 6-phosphofructokinase and an abc transport system, whereas a distinct inulin-induced 1-phosphofructokinase was linked to a fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system (pts ii transport enzyme). real-time pcr analysis showed that the beta-fructofuranosidase and adjacent abc transport protein showed greatest induction during growth on inulin, whereas the 1-phosphofructokinase enzyme and linked sugar phosphotransferase transport system were most strongly up-regulated during growth on fructose, indicating that these two clusters play distinct roles in the use of inulin. the r. inulinivorans beta-fructofuranosidase was overexpressed in escherichia coli and shown to hydrolyze fructans ranging from inulin down to sucrose, with greatest activity on fructo-oligosaccharides. genes induced on starch included the major extracellular alpha-amylase and two distinct alpha-glucanotransferases together with a gene encoding a flagellin protein. the latter response may be concerned with improving bacterial access to  insoluble starch particles.

TI  == a new tetracycline efflux gene, tet(40), is located in tandem with tet(o/32/o) in a human gut firmicute bacterium and in metagenomic library clones.
AB  == the bacterium clostridium saccharolyticum k10, isolated from a fecal sample obtained from a healthy donor who had received long-term tetracycline therapy, was found to carry three tetracycline resistance genes: tet(w) and the mosaic tet(o/32/o), both conferring ribosome protection-type resistance, and a novel, closely linked efflux-type resistance gene designated tet(40). tet(40) encodes a  predicted membrane-associated protein with 42% amino acid identity to teta(p). tetracycline did not accumulate in escherichia coli cells expressing the tet(40)  efflux protein, and resistance to tetracycline was reduced when cells were incubated with an efflux pump inhibitor. e. coli cells carrying tet(40) had a 50% inhibitory concentration of tetracycline of 60 microg/ml. analysis of a transconjugant from a mating between donor strain c. saccharolyticum k10 and the  recipient human gut commensal bacterium roseburia inulinivorans suggested that tet(o/32/o) and tet(40) were cotransferred on a mobile element. sequence analysis of a 37-kb insert identified on the basis of tetracycline resistance from a metagenomic fosmid library again revealed a tandem arrangement of tet(o/32/o) and tet(40), flanked by regions with homology to parts of the vang operon previously  identified in enterococcus faecalis. at least 10 of the metagenomic inserts that  carried tet(o/32/o) also carried tet(40), suggesting that tet(40), although previously undetected, may be an abundant efflux gene.
