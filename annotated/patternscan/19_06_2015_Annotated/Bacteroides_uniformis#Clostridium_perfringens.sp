TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == maldi-tof identification of the human gut microbiome in people with and without diarrhea in senegal.
AB  == background: in africa, there are several problems with the specific identification of bacteria. recently, maldi-tof mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for the routine microbial identification in many clinical laboratories. methodology/principal findings: this study was conducted using feces from 347 individuals (162 with diarrhea and 185 without diarrhea) sampled in health centers in dakar, senegal. feces were transported from dakar to marseille, france, where they were cultured using different culture conditions. the isolated colonies were identified using maldi-tof. if a colony was unidentified, 16s rrna sequencing was performed. overall, 2,753 isolates were tested, allowing for the identification of 189 bacteria from 5 phyla, including 2 previously unknown species, 11 species not previously reported in the human gut,  10 species not previously reported in humans, and 3 fungi. 2,718 bacterial isolates (98.8%) out of 2,750 yielded an accurate identification using mass spectrometry, as did the 3 candida albicans isolates. thirty-two bacterial isolates not identified by maldi-tof (1.2%) were identified by sequencing, allowing for the identification of 2 new species. the number of bacterial species per fecal sample was significantly higher among patients without diarrhea (8.6+/-3) than in those with diarrhea (7.3+/-3.4; p = 0.0003). a modification of  the gut microbiota was observed between the two groups. in individuals with diarrhea, major commensal bacterial species such as e. coli were significantly decreased (85% versus 64%), as were several enterococcus spp. (e. faecium and e.  casseliflavus) and anaerobes, such as bacteroides spp. (b. uniformis and b. vulgatus) and clostridium spp. (c. bifermentans, c. orbiscindens, c. perfringens, and c. symbosium). conversely, several bacillus spp. (b. licheniformis, b. mojavensis, and b. pumilus) were significantly more frequent among patients with  diarrhea. conclusions/significance: maldi-tof is a potentially powerful tool for  routine bacterial identification in africa, allowing for a quick identification of bacterial species.

TI  == isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  == media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (nsp) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. e. faecium , streptococcus , bacteroides and clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind  gut of chickens. strict anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides ovatus , b. uniformis , presumably b. capillosus and clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16s rdna homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. additionally, streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in sds/page zymograms.

TI  == a new bacteroides conjugative transposon that carries an ermb gene.
AB  == the erythromycin resistance gene ermb has been found in a variety of gram-positive bacteria. this gene has also been found in bacteroides species but  only in six recently isolated strains; thus, the gene seems to have entered this  genus only recently. one of the six bacteroides ermb-containing isolates, wh207,  could transfer ermb to bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain bt4001 by conjugation. wh207 was identified as a bacteroides uniformis strain based on the sequence of its 16s rrna gene. results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis experiments demonstrated that the transferring element was normally integrated into the bacteroides chromosome. the element was estimated from pulsed-field gel data to be about 100 kb in size. since the element appeared to be a conjugative transposon (ctn), it was designated ctnbst. ctnbst was able to mobilize coresident plasmids and the circular form of the mobilizable transposon nbu1 to bacteroides and escherichia coli recipients. a 13-kb segment that contained ermb  was cloned and sequenced. most of the open reading frames in this region had little similarity at the amino acid sequence level to any proteins in the sequence databases, but a 1,723-bp dna segment that included a 950-bp segment downstream of ermb had a dna sequence that was virtually identical to that of a segment of dna found previously in a clostridium perfringens strain. this finding, together with the finding that ermb is located on a ctn, supports the hypothesis that ctnbst could have entered bacteroides from some other genus, possibly from gram-positive bacteria. moreover, this finding supports the hypothesis that many transmissible antibiotic resistance genes in bacteroides are carried on ctns.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of flomoxef compared to moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and  clindamycin against anaerobes.
AB  == to assess the in vitro activity of flomoxef (6315-s), moxalactam, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against anaerobes 197 clinical isolates (27 bacteroides fragilis, 42 b. thetaiotaomicron, 10 b. vulgatus, 7 b. ovatus, 6 b. uniformis, 6 b. distasonis, 7 bacteroides melaninogenicus group, 11 bacteroides oralis group, 21 clostridium difficile, 7 c. perfringens, 3 c. sporogenes, 3 clostridium spp., 33 propionibacterium acnes, 14 peptococcaceae) were studied by  means of agar dilution tests. the mic90 of b. fragilis was less than 2 micrograms/ml for flomoxef, less than 4 micrograms/ml for moxalactam, less than 16 micrograms/ml for cefoxitin, less than 128 micrograms/ml for cefotaxime and less than 2 micrograms/ml for clindamycin. the respective mic90's of b. thetaiotaomicron were less than 64, less than 128, less than 32, less than 256 and 8 micrograms/ml. strains of the other bacteroides species and groups were more susceptible to flomoxef and the other antibiotics than b. thetaiotaomicron.  against clostridium difficile flomoxef (mic90 less than 4 micrograms/ml) proved to be superior to the other agents tested. most of the clostridium strains other  than c. difficile were also susceptible to flomoxef; anaerobic grampositive cocci and propionibacterium acnes were very sensitive (mic90's less than 1 and less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml, respectively). its anti-anaerobic activity, together with its efficacy against aerobes, should make flomoxef a useful adjunct to the arsenal of modern antibiotic therapy.

TI  == rapid glutamic acid decarboxylase test for identification of bacteroides and clostridium spp.
AB  == a rapid 4-h test for glutamic acid decarboxylase is described for the identification of certain anaerobic bacteria. the test substrate consisted of 1.0 g of l-glutamic acid, 0.3 ml of triton x-155, and 0.05 g of bromcresol green sodium salt in 1 liter of water. the substrate was dispensed in 0.5-ml amounts into test tubes, and a turbid suspension was made with the test organism. the test was then incubated aerobically at 35 degrees c for 4 h. the development of a blue color was considered positive. a total of 345 strains of clinically isolated anaerobic bacteria were tested. all isolates of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis. clostridium perfringens, and clostridium sordellii gave a positive reaction. some isolates of bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides vulgatus were also positive. the use of this rapid test in conjunction with other rapid methods, such as the spot indol test, will enable laboratory workers to report these pathogens on the same day on which an inoculum of pure culture growth on agar is available.

TI  == acute appendicitis and bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == bacteria belonging to the bacteroides fragilis group (b. fragilis, b. ovatus, b.  vulgatus, b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis) were cultured in quantities of less than or equal to 10(5) c.f.u./ml from the excised appendix from 30 patients. twenty-two patients (group i) had an acute purulent appendicitis (three with perforation), four were classified as slightly inflamed  cases (group 2) and four had a normal appendix (group 3). the b. fragilis group of bacteria dominated among the anaerobic isolates, but bifidobacteria, fusobacteri, clostridium perfringens, lactobacilli, leptotrichia and veillonella, in decreasing order, were isolated as well. among isolates of aerobic bacteria, e. coli was most frequently isolated (26/30 patients). no other genus was isolated from more than four of the appendices. serological investigations of the humoral antibody response to polysaccharide antigens from four of the bacteroides species showed that a doubling of the titer, or more, in paired serum samples could be observed as follows: against b. fragilis 6/22 patients (group 1), 3/8 patients (groups 2 and 3). the corresponding figures for b. ovatus were 11/22 and 2/8, b. vulgatus 3/22 and 0/8 and b. distasonis 4/22 and 0/8. sera from two patients with ruptured appendix, and b. fragilis cultivated, showed the highest titer increases against the b. fragilis antigen. the data from the bacteriological and immunological investigations make us conclude that (i) the b. fragilis group of bacteria is the most common anaerobic group of bacteria isolated from normal and diseased appendices, (ii) the mere isolation of b. fragilis, encapsulated or not, does not imply an etiological role in appendicitis since there was no obvious difference in titer increases against b. fragilis in sera from patients with or without an inflamed appendix, and (iii) high, and significant, titer increases against b. fragilis are seen in sera from patients with ruptured appendix.
