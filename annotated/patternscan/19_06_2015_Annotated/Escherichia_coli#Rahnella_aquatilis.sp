TI  == prevalence and characterization of esbl- and ampc-producing enterobacteriaceae on retail vegetables.
AB  == in total 1216 vegetables obtained from dutch stores during 2012 and 2013 were analysed to determine the prevalence of 3rd-generation cephalosporin (3gc) resistant bacteria on soil-grown fresh produce possibly consumed raw. vegetables  grown conventionally and organically, from dutch as well as foreign origin were compared. included were the following vegetable types; blanched celery (n=192), bunched carrots (n=190), butterhead lettuce (n=137), chicory (n=96), endive (n=188), iceberg lettuce (n=193) and radish (n=120). overall, 3gc-resistant enterobacteriaceae were detected on 5.2% of vegetables. based on primary habitat  and mechanism of 3gc-resistance, these bacteria could be divided into four groups: esbl-producing faecal species (escherichia coli, enterobacter spp.), ampc-producing faecal species (citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp.), esbl-producing environmental species (pantoea spp., rahnella aquatilis, serratia  fonticola), and ampc-producing environmental species (cedecca spp., hafnia alvei, pantoea spp., serratia plymuthica), which were detected on 0.8%, 1.2%, 2.6% and 0.4% of the vegetables analysed, respectively. contamination with faecal 3gc-resistant bacteria was most frequently observed in root and bulb vegetables (average prevalence 4.4%), and less frequently in stem vegetables (prevalence 1.6%) and leafy greens (average prevalence 0.6%). in dutch stores, only four of the included vegetable types (blanched celery, bunched carrots, endive, iceberg lettuce) were available in all four possible variants: dutch/conventional, dutch/organic, foreign/conventional, foreign/organic. with respect to these vegetable types, no statistically significant difference was observed in prevalence of 3gc-resistant enterobacteriaceae between country of origin or cultivation type (5.2%, 5.7%, 5.7% and 3.3%, respectively). vegetables consumed raw may be a source of dissemination of 3gc-resistant enterobacteriaceae and their resistance genes to humans. the magnitude of the associated public health risk presumably depends on the types of bacteria that are ingested, i.e., faecal  or environmental species, and may therefore be higher for root and bulb vegetables compared to leafy greens.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria are not detected in supragingival plaque samples from human fecal carriers of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == background: the prevalence of infections caused by cefotaximase-munich (ctx-m)-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (esbl-e) has rapidly increased during the past 15 years. enterobacteriaceae are commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and long-term intestinal carriage is considered important for the spread of esbl and as a source of clinical infections. oral biofilm such as supragingival plaque is known to contain numerous antibiotic resistance determinants and may also represent a poorly investigated site for esbl carriage and further spread. objective: to investigate possible carriage of esbl-producing bacteria in supragingival plaque of known fecal carriers of these bacteria. design: we screened for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic esbl-producing bacteria and bla ctx-m in supragingival plaque samples from healthy human adults with culture-verified fecal carriage of ctx-m-producing escherichia coli. the presence or absence of enterobacteriaceae and esbl-producing bacteria in plaque samples was evaluated using culture-based methods and consensus ctx-m pcr. results: oral samples were obtained from 17 participants with known previous carriage of esbl-producing e. coli. no esbl-producing bacteria or esbl genes were detected using culture-based and molecular methods. one colony of rahnella aquatilis harboring the class a esbl gene bla rahn-1/2 was identified in an oral sample from one of the participants.  conclusion: this pilot study supports the notion that the presence of ctx-m-producing bacteria is uncommon in oral plaque of healthy human adult fecal  carriers. due to the limited number of persons tested, a low prevalence of oral esbl-carriage in healthy adults or carriage in selected groups of patients cannot be excluded. to our knowledge, this is the first description of an r. aquatilis with the rahn-1/2 gene in the oral cavity.

TI  == identification and genetics of 6-thioguanine secreted by erwinia species and its  interference with the growth of other bacteria.
AB  == we identified a compound in culture supernatants of erwinia species, such as erwinia amylovora, e. pyrifoliae, e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis, e. persicina and e. rhapontici absorbing at 340 nm, which was associated before with the yellow pigment produced by e. amylovora on media containing copper ions. the compound was purified from e. tasmaniensis strain et1/99 supernatants by chromatography on dowex-1 and dowex-50 columns and identified by hplc/ms and nmr  analysis as 6-thioguanine (6tg). its signal at 167 da matched with the expected molecular mass. by random mutagenesis with minitn5, we obtained mutants defective in the genes for pyrimidine and purine metabolism. a specific gene cluster with ycf genes described by us before, absent in the corresponding region of escherichia coli, was identified in the genome sequence of three erwinia species  and named tgs region for thioguanine synthesis. clones of the tgs gene cluster promoted 6tg synthesis and secretion in e. coli, when the bacteria were grown in  minimal medium supplemented with amino acids. 6tg was bacteriostatic for e. coli  and salmonella typhimurium strains, with cell growth resumed after prolonged incubation. similar results were obtained with p. agglomerans strains. bacteria from the genus pectobacterium were barely and rahnella or gibbsiella species were not inhibited by 6tg. adenine and guanine relieved the toxic effect of 6tg on e.  coli. non-producing strains were fully virulent on host plants. 6tg synthesis may help erwinias to interfere with growth of some microorganisms in the environment.

TI  == characterization of an extended-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from a novel enterobacterial species taxonomically related to rahnella spp./ewingella spp.
AB  == objectives: to characterize the naturally occurring beta-lactamase gene identified from a clinical isolate belonging to a novel enterobacterial species that is closely related to rahnella spp. and ewingella spp. methods: shotgun cloning and expression in escherichia coli were performed in order to characterize this resistance determinant. enzymatic activities were measured by uv spectrophotometry after an ion-exchange chromatography purification procedure. results: a chromosomal gene coding for the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) smo-1 was identified from a novel enterobacterial species that is taxonomically related to rahnella aquatilis and ewingella americana. the beta-lactamase efficiently hydrolysed penicillins and cefotaxime, and shared 75%  amino acid identity with the plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase sfo-1 from serratia  fonticola, 74% amino acid identity with the plasmid-mediated esbl ctx-m-2 originating from kluyvera spp. and 72% amino acid identity with the chromosomally encoded and intrinsic rahn-1 from r. aquatilis. conclusions: we have identified a novel enterobacterial species recovered from a clinical specimen, constituting another potential source of acquired esbl. the esbl shared significant similarities with the ctx-m-type enzymes.

TI  == a novel 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase from rahnella aquatilis with  significantly reduced glyphosate sensitivity.
AB  == the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (epsps; ec 2.5.1.19) is a key enzyme in the shikimate pathway for the production of aromatic amino acids and chorismate-derived secondary metabolites in plants, fungi, and microorganisms. it is also the target of the broad-spectrum herbicide glyphosate. natural glyphosate resistance is generally thought to occur within microorganisms in a strong selective pressure condition. rahnella aquatilis strain gr20, an antagonist against pathogenic agrobacterial strains of grape crown gall, was isolated from the rhizosphere of grape in glyphosate-contaminated vineyards. a novel gene encoding epsps was identified from the isolated bacterium by complementation of an escherichia coli auxotrophic aroa mutant. the epsps, named aroa(r. aquatilis), was expressed and purified from e. coli, and key kinetic values were determined.  the full-length enzyme exhibited higher tolerance to glyphosate than the e. coli  epsps (aroa(e. coli)), while retaining high affinity for the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate. transgenic plants of aroa(r. aquatilis) were also observed to be more resistant to glyphosate at a concentration of 5 mm than that of aroa(e. coli). to probe the sites contributing to increased tolerance to glyphosate, mutant r. aquatilis epsps enzymes were produced with the c-strand of  subdomain 3 and the f-strand of subdomain 5 (thr38lys, arg40val, arg222gln, ser224val, ile225val, and gln226lys) substituted by the corresponding region of the e. coli epsps. the mutant enzyme exhibited greater sensitivity to glyphosate  than the wild type r. aquatilis epsps with little change of affinity for its first substrate, shikimate-3-phosphate (s3p) and phosphoenolpyruvate (pep). the effect of the residues on subdomain 5 on glyphosate resistance was more obvious.

TI  == identification of the region required for maintaining phw126 in its monomeric form.
AB  == the phw126-like plasmids are a recently discovered small group of cryptic plasmids replicating by the rolling circle mode. the replication origin of phw126 consists of a conserved stretch, four perfect direct repeats and a so-called accessory region. the latter increases plasmid stability but is not absolutely necessary for replication. here, we report that deletion of the accessory region  causes rapid multimerization of phw126. while the number of phw126-units per cell remains constant, the number of physically independent plasmid molecules is reduced by approximately 40%, rendering random distribution to daughter cells less effective. a conserved inverted repeat within the accessory region could be  identified as a sequence necessary for maintaining phw126 in its monomeric form.  a mutant version of phw126 lacking this inverted repeat could be rescued by placing the single-strand initiation site (ssi) of phw15 on the plus strand, while including the ssi in the opposite direction had no effect. thus, our data provide evidence that multimer formation is, besides copy number reduction and ssdna accumulation, an additional means how loss of a mechanism ensuring efficient lagging strand synthesis may cause destabilization of rolling circle plasmids.

TI  == occurrence of gram-negative bacteria in hens' eggs depending on their source and  storage conditions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the qualitative composition of gram-negative microbes, mainly of the family enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic bacteria  such as salmonella, in the albumens and yolks and on the shells of hens' eggs, depending on their source and on the temperature and duration of their storage. a total of 375 table eggs were studied, from a large-scale poultry farm, a small-scale poultry farm and a supermarket. each group was divided into 5 subgroups according to the temperature and duration of their storage during the study. two serotypes of bacteria of the genus salmonella were identified: s. enteritidis and s. arizonae. strains of salmonella spp. were also isolated. apart from salmonella and escherichia coli, among the most frequently isolated bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae were enterobacter spp., klebsiella spp. and citrobacter freundii. qualitative analysis of the bacterial microflora of the eggs also showed the presence of other gram negative bacteria, including acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp., tatumella ptyseos, providencia stuartii, serratia liquefaciens, flavimonas oryzihabitans, vibrio metschnikovii, leclercia  adecarboxylata, kluyvera spp., rahnella aquatilis, proteus mirabilis, and achromobacter spp. the study demonstrated that the conditions applied, i.e., the  temperature and duration of storage, did not significantly influence the prevalence of particular species of gram-negative bacteria in the eggs. however,  based on the analysis of contamination of eggs with salmonella depending on their source, it can be concluded that the system in which the hens are housed affects  the risk of contamination of eggs with these pathogens.

TI  == production of biogenic amines "in vitro" in relation to the growth phase by enterobacteriaceae species isolated from traditional sausages.
AB  == histidine, lysine, ornithine and tyrosine decarboxylase activities were tested in 79 strains of enterobacteriaceae (41 of hafnia alvei, 17 of serratia liquefaciens, 5 of enterobacter cloacae, 4 of citrobacter braakii, 2 of proteus vulgaris, 2 of proteus mirabilis, 2 of providencia stuartii, 2 of klebsiella terrigena, 1 of rahnella aquatilis, 1 of salmonella arizonae, 1 of citrobacter youngae and 1 of escherichia coli) isolated from botillo, a spanish traditional sausage. in general, the strains were positive for all four activities, with the  exception of two strains of h. alvei and the e. coli strain, which did not display histidine decarboxylase activity. the strains of p. mirabilis and p. stuartii did not exhibit any of the four activities tested. accumulation of putrescine and cadaverine was studied throughout growth of the 75 strains that displayed ornithine and lysine decarboxylase activities. biogenic amines were produced particularly in the exponential phase, with maximum accumulation occurring after between 12 to 72 h, depending on the biogenic amine and microbial species considered. maximum accumulation of putrescine varied greatly between species and within the same species, and ranged from 18 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 7325 mg/l in a h. alvei strain. maximum accumulation of cadaverine varied less than that of putrescine, and ranged from 30 mg/l in the r. aquatilis  strain to 1935 mg/l in a s. liquefaciens strain.

TI  == an efficient plasmid vector for constitutive high-level expression of foreign genes in escherichia coli.
AB  == the levansucrase gene (lsra) from rahnella aquatilis was strongly expressed in a  constitutive manner in escherichia coli when cloned into a pbluescript ks-based prl1cp plasmid vector. the native promoter upstream of lsra and the lacz promoter cooperatively enhanced the expression of lsra to a level that was comparable to that of the t7 promoter, which is used in commercial pet expression vector system. a putative rho-independent transcription termination signal downstream of lsra was crucial for gene expression. this plasmid vector also proved to be applicable for efficient expression of other foreign genes in e. coli.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae and related organisms isolated from shell eggs collected during commercial processing.
AB  == in the united states, commercial shell eggs are washed and graded before retail.  since passage of the egg products inspection act in 1971, processing guidelines have been set to ensure that external and internal characteristics are maintained. however, less is known about how commercial processing affects the safety of shell eggs. to identify enteric bacteria entering plants and persisting throughout processing, eggs were collected from 3 us commercial shell egg-processing plants on 3 separate visits. on each plant visit, 12 eggs were collected from each of 12 sites along the processing line: accumulator, prewash rinse, first washer, second washer, sanitizer rinse, dryer, oiler, check detection/scales, 2 egg grader/packer head lanes, rewash belt entrance, and rewash belt exit. each egg was sampled by a rinse technique, and the rinsate was  plated onto violet red bile glucose agar with overlay for the detection and enumeration of enterobacteriaceae. from each plate, up to 5 colonies were randomly selected and isolated for identification to genus or species by using biochemical tests. several genera and species were detected at each of the 3 plants. sites from which the greatest numbers of isolates were identified were those collected from eggs during preprocessing (accumulator, prewash rinse) or from eggs judged as dirty (rewash belt entrance or exit). sites yielding the smallest number of isolates were those during or at the end of processing. escherichia coli and enterobacter spp. were isolated from each of the 9 plant visits. other genera isolated from at least 1 of the 3 plants included cedecea, citrobacter, erwinia, hafnia, klebsiella, kluyvera, leclercia, morganella, proteus, providencia, rahnella, salmonella, and serratia. non-enterobacteriaceae  isolated and identified included aeromonas, chryseomonas, listonella, pseudomonas, sphingobacterium, vibrio, and xanthomonas. all of the genera and species were recovered less frequently from fully processed eggs than from unwashed eggs, indicating that shell eggs are less contaminated with bacteria as  a result of commercial washing procedures.

TI  == binding of nontarget microorganisms from food washes to anti-salmonella and anti-e. coli o157 immunomagnetic beads: most probable composition of background eubacteria.
AB  == we present herein the composition of bacterial communities occurring in ground chicken and the changes which arise in these populations based upon nonselective  partitioning by commercially-available dynal anti-salmonella and anti-e. coli o157 immunomagnetic beads (imb). our enumeration and colony selection protocol was based upon a 6 x 6 drop plate method (n = 18 for each 25-g sub-sampling) using a dilution which resulted in ca. 4-8 colonies per drop. an average of 82 +/- 13 colonies were selected from three 25-g ground chicken subsamplings per batch, each of which was repeated seasonally for one year. dna was extracted from each colony and the composition of eubacteria in each of these harvests was determined by sequence-based identification of 16s rdna amplicons. the gram-positive bacteria brochothrix thermosphacta and carnobacterium maltaromticum were the most commonly found organisms in both the total chicken wash (pbs) and in the imb-bound (pbs-washed) fractions. the remaining background organisms which also adhered to varying degrees to commercial imbs were: pseudomonas oleovorans,  acinetobacter lwoffi, serratia spp., and one rahnella spp. a large number of the  organisms were also cladistically evaluated based on rdna basepair disparities: all brochothrices were monophyletic; twelve different pseudomonads were found along with eight carnobacteria, seven acinetobacteres, four serratiae, and two rahnellae. carnobacterium alone showed an imb-based concentration enhancement (ca. two to sixfold).

TI  == coliform and pathologic bacteria in sierra nevada national forest wilderness area lakes and streams.
AB  == objective: to analyze backcountry-area water quality in us department of agriculture forest service-designated wilderness areas for the presence of coliform and potentially pathogenic bacteria. methods: thirty-one backcountry lakes and streams were selected that would stratify the risk based on use by backpackers, pack animals, commercial grazing animals, or natural unaffected wilderness areas. sites included desolation wilderness (10 sites), carson-iceberg wilderness (4 sites), emigrant wilderness (3 sites), hoover wilderness (6 sites), john muir wilderness (3 sites), and golden trout wilderness (5 sites). water was  collected in sterile tubes and quantification was performed through millipore bacterial samplers. on return to the laboratory, bacteria were harvested from the samplers and subjected to qualitative analysis that identified species according  to standard laboratory methods. results: coliform bacteria were detected in 14 of 31 sites (45%). eight sites had high levels of coliforms. all 8 of these sites correlated with heavy human use or commercial grazing. coliforms were identified  as escherichia coli. in addition, 1 sample contained yersinia entercolitica. all  samples contained expected amounts of normal aquatic bacteria, including pseudomonas spp, rahnella aquatilis, serratia spp, and other nonpathogenic species of yersinia in concentrations of 600 to 10,000 colony-forming units per 100 ml. conclusions: in this study, coliform bacteria were found at nearly half of the sampling sites. high coliform levels correlated with high-impact human use or cattle grazing.

TI  == histamine-related hygienic qualities and bacteria found in popular commercial scombroid fish fillets in taiwan.
AB  == to determine the histamine-related hygienic qualities and bacteria of scombroid fish fillets sold in traditional retail markets, 61 samples were collected from northern and southern taiwan. it was found that the content of volatile base nitrogen in most samples was below 25 mg/100 g, which is the regulatory level in  taiwan. the ratio of unacceptable samples/total samples for aerobic plate count and escherichia coli was 100% and 15% in northern samples and 100% and 20% in southern samples, respectively, compared with the requirements of hygienic standards. the average content of various biogenic amines in all samples were lower than 3 mg/100 g, except for histamine average content (4.6 mg/100 g) in southern samples. among southern samples, four samples contained 12.8 to 28.8 mg/100 g histamine, which is more than 5 mg/100 g that is the allowable limit suggested by the u.s. food and drug administration. furthermore, 14 bacterial strains were isolated from sailfish fillets on a selective medium for histamine-forming bacteria. these presumptive histamine-forming strains, such as  proteus, enterobacter, klebsiella, rahnella, and acinetobacter, have been identified and found to produce 20 to 2,000 ppm histamine after incubating at 37  degrees c for 24 h.

TI  == development of a plating medium for selection of helicobacter pylori from water samples.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a simple plating medium to allow large-scale screening of water samples for the presence of helicobacter pylori. five conventional plating media (brain heart infusion, brucella agar, columbia blood agar base, campylobacter agar kit skirrow, and hpspa medium), each containing a commercial antibiotic supplement, were initially evaluated. eight strains selected as common waterborne organisms (acinetobacter, aeromonas, bacillus, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococcus, helicobacter pylori, and  pseudomonas strains) were individually plated onto each of these media. three organisms (acinetobacter, e. coli, and h. pylori) were able to grow on all five media. this growth was unacceptable since helicobacter grows very slowly and competing organisms must be inhibited for up to 7 days. therefore, a more selective medium (hp agar) containing a novel mixture of growth supplements plus  amphotericin b and polymyxin b was developed. this medium also included a phenol  red color indicator for urease production. aliquots of nonsterile well water that contained native flora (flavobacterium, serratia, citrobacter, pasteurella, ochrobactrum, rahnella, and unidentified molds) and were further adulterated with the eight strains listed above (10(6) cfu of each strain per 100 ml) were spiked  with h. pylori and were plated. in spite of the heavy mixed microbial load, only  h. pylori colonies grew during 7 days of incubation at 37 degrees c. the color indicator system allowed presumptive identification of h. pylori colonies sooner  (12 to 20 h) than the conventional media tested allowed. the hp formulation developed in this study provides a medium with superior selectivity for h. pylori from mixed microbial populations in water and reduces the time required to complete the assay.

TI  == identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from erwinia persicina.
AB  == from whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, erp-1, with a pi value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kda. erp-1 shared 45 to 50% amino  acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from citrobacter koseri, kluyvera ascorbata, kluyvera cryocrescens, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus penneri, rahnella aquatilis, serratia fonticola, yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-9. the substrate profile of the noninducible erp-1 was similar  to that of these beta-lactamases. erp-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.

TI  == molecular characterization of the growth phase-dependent expression of the lsra gene, encoding levansucrase of rahnella aquatilis.
AB  == expression of the lsra gene from rahnella aquatilis, encoding levansucrase, is tightly regulated by the growth phase of the host cell; low-level expression was  observed in the early phase of cell growth, but expression was significantly stimulated in the late phase. northern blot analysis revealed that regulation occurred at the level of transcription. the promoter region was identified by primer extension analysis. two opposite genetic elements that participate in the  regulation of lsra expression were identified upstream of the lsra gene: the lsrs gene and the lsrr region. the lsrs gene encodes a protein consisting of 70 amino  acid residues (m(r), 8,075), which positively activated lsra expression approximately 20-fold in a growth phase-dependent fashion. the cis-acting lsrr region, which repressed lsra expression about 10-fold, was further narrowed to two dna regions by deletion analysis. the concerted action of two opposite regulatory functions resulted in the growth phase-dependent activation of gene expression in escherichia coli independent of the stationary sigma factor sigma(s).

TI  == differences in attachment of salmonella enterica serovars and escherichia coli o157:h7 to alfalfa sprouts.
AB  == numerous salmonella enterica and escherichia coli o157:h7 outbreaks have been associated with contaminated sprouts. we examined how s. enterica serovars, e. coli serotypes, and nonpathogenic bacteria isolated from alfalfa sprouts grow on  and adhere to alfalfa sprouts. growth on and adherence to sprouts were not significantly different among different serovars of s. enterica, but all s. enterica serovars grew on and adhered to alfalfa sprouts significantly better than e. coli o157:h7. e. coli o157:h7 was essentially rinsed from alfalfa sprouts with repeated washing steps, while 1 to 2 log cfu of s. enterica remained attached per sprout. s. enterica newport adhered to 3-day-old sprouts as well as  pantoea agglomerans and 10-fold more than pseudomonas putida and rahnella aquatilis, whereas the growth rates of all four strains throughout seed sprouting were similar. s. enterica newport and plant-associated bacteria adhered 10- to 1,000-fold more than e. coli o157:h7; however, three of four other e. coli serotypes, isolated from cabbage roots exposed to sewage water following a spill, adhered to sprouts better than e. coli o157:h7 and as well as the pseudomonas and rahnella strains. therefore, attachment to alfalfa sprouts among e. coli serotypes is variable, and nonpathogenic strains of e. coli to be used as surrogates for the study of pathogenic e. coli may be difficult to identify and should be selected carefully, with knowledge of the biology being examined.

TI  == comparison of methods for determining the numbers and species distribution of coliform bacteria in well water samples.
AB  == aims: enumeration of coliform bacteria and escherichia coli is the most widely used method in the estimation of hygienic quality of drinking water. the yield of target bacteria and the species composition of different populations of coliform  bacteria may depend on the method.three methods were compared. methods and results: three membrane filtration methods were used for the enumeration of coliform bacteria in shallow well waters. the yield of confirmed coliform bacteria was highest on differential coliform agar, followed by les endo agar. differential coliform agar had the highest proportion of typical colonies, of which 74% were confirmed as belonging to the enterobacteriaceae. of the typical colonies on lactose tergitol 7 ttc agar, 75% were confirmed as enterobacteriaceae, whereas 92% of typical colonies on les endo agar belonged to  the enterobacteriaceae. les endo agar yielded many serratia strains, lactose tergitol 7 ttc agar yielded numerous strains of rahnella aquatilis and enterobacter, whereas differential coliform agar yielded the widest range of species. conclusion: the yield of coliform bacteria varied between methods. each  method compared had a characteristic species distribution of target bacteria and  a typical level of interference of non-target bacteria. identification with routine physiological tests to distinct species was hampered by the slight differences between species. high yield and sufficient selectivity are difficult  to achieve simultaneously, especially if the target group is diverse. significance and impact of the study: the results showed that several aspects of  method performance should be considered, and that the target group must be distinctly defined to enable method comparisons.

TI  == molecular cloning of a gene encoding the thermoactive levansucrase from rrahnella aquatilis and its growth phase-dependent expression in eescherichia coli.
AB  == a levansucrase gene (lsra) from rahnella aquatilis atcc33071 was isolated from a  genomic library and the nucleotide sequence of the lsra structural gene was determined. lsra is composed of 1248 bp and encodes 415 amino acid residues with  a calculated molecular mass of 45.9 kda. although the amino acid sequence of lsra gene showed good conservation with the sequences of reported levansucrases and of the conserved regions thought to be implicated in the enzyme activity, comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences certified the dissimilarity of the proteins from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the lsra gene was expressed from its own promoter in escherichia coli in an active form. the lsra expression in e. coli-prl1cpr was affected by the growth phase of cells: it was repressed in the early phase of growth, but was significantly stimulated during the entrance of cells into the late phase of growth. the growth-phase-dependent fashion of lsra expression was altered in a constitutive-like fashion by the deletion of an upstream region of lsra (pnd137), suggesting that the growth-phase dependent expression of lsra was mediated by the deleted upstream region.

TI  == refolding and purification of zymomonas mobilis levansucrase produced as inclusion bodies in fed-batch culture of recombinant escherichia coli.
AB  == zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was overproduced by the fed-batch culture of recombinant escherichia coli harboring a novel expression system that is constitutively expressed by the promoter from the rahnella aquatilis levansucrase gene. most of the levansucrase was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial  cytoplasm, accounting for approximately 20% of the total cellular protein. refolding after complete denaturation by high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride was not successful, resulting in large amounts of insoluble aggregates. during the development of the refolding method, it was found that direct solubilization of the inclusion bodies with triton x-100 reactivated the enzyme, with a considerable refolding efficiency. about 65% of inclusion body levansucrase was refolded into active levansucrase in the renaturation buffer containing 4% (v/v) triton x-100. the in vitro refolded enzyme was purified to 95% purity by single-step deae-sepharose ion exchange chromatography. triton x-100 was removed by this ion exchange chromatography.

AB  == among recent clinical isolates in japan, strain cu264 was discovered which formed unusual colonies. this strain was identified as rahnella aquatilis which is usually found in water. the antibiotic susceptibilities against tetracycline, carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, sulphonamide, neomycin, fosfomycin, rifampicin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid, were investigated. the result demonstrated that the strain was highly resistant to fosfomycin only. it was further shown that this resistance was transmissible with low frequency to serratia marcescens whereas it was not transmissible to escherichia coli.

TI  == enterobacteriaceae found in high numbers in fish, minced meat and pasteurised milk or cream and the presence of toxin encoding genes.
AB  == enterobacteriaceae were found in high numbers after storage at 7 degrees c in 6%  of consumers packs of pasteurised milk or cream, in 31% of retailed fish and in 100% of retail packs of minced meat. seventy two fresh-water fishes, 40 packs of  minced meat and 430 milk packs were sampled. one hundred and eighty four isolates were randomly picked from tryptone glucose extract (tge) agar (30 degrees c for 3d) or violet red bile glucose (vrbg) agar (37 degrees c for 1d). in minced meat, serratia liquefaciens, hafnia alvei, rahnella aquatilis were frequently encountered. on fish, the most frequently found species were r. aquatilis, and in milk, the dominating species were s. liquefaciens, h. alvei and r. aquatilis. one to three isolates of citrobacter freundii were found in all three food categories. using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique, the gene of escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (lt) was indicated in one fish isolate of r. aquatilis whereas heat-stable toxin genes (s.t.) were indicated in four h. alvei  isolates, two originating from fish and two from minced meat. positive pcr-reaction for vero cytotoxin genes were found in one h. alvei strain originating from fish (vt1), in two s. liquefaciens strains from minced meat (vt2), and in a c. freundii reference strain. one of the st-positive h. alvei strains from meat harboured the eaea gene involved in the attaching phenotype of  enteropathogenic e. coli.

TI  == expression of genes from rahnella aquatilis that are necessary for mineral phosphate solubilization in escherichia coli.
AB  == rahnella aquatilis is a gram-negative bacterium that can fix atmospheric nitrogen and also has the ability to solubilize mineral phosphate. we have cloned the genes that confer the mineral phosphate solubilizing (mps) trait from this organism by mobilizing a cosmid library of r. aquatilis into escherichia coli hb101. a 7.0-kb ecori fragment from a cosmid, when transferred into e. coli strains hb101 and dh5 alpha, conferred the ability to solubilize hydroxyapatite and the production of gluconic acid to e. coli. the relative amounts of soluble phosphate and gluconic acid produced by the cloned 7.0-kb ecori fragment in e. coli were significantly higher than those of r. aquatilis. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two complete open reading frames (orf1 and orf2) and a partial  orf, orf1 and orf2 encoded proteins of molecular mass 10 kda and 44 kda. the 44-kda protein showed extensive sequence similarity to pqqe of erwinia herbicola, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the 10-kda protein revealed strong similarity to the pqqd of k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

TI  == a major outer membrane protein of rahnella aquatilis functions as a porin and root adhesin.
AB  == a 38-kda major outer membrane protein (omp) was isolated from the nitrogen-fixing enterobacterium rahnella aquatilis cf3. this protein exists as a stable trimer in the presence of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at temperatures below 60 degrees c. single channel experiments showed that this major omp of r. aquatilis cf3 is able to form pores in the planar lipid membrane. two oligonucleotides encoding the n-terminal portion of the 38-kda omp and c-terminal portion of ompc were used to  amplify the 38-kda gene by pcr. the deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong homology with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, and serratia marcescens ompc sequences, except loops l6 and l7, which are postulated  to be cell surface exposed. on the basis of the ompf-phoe three-dimensional structure, it seems likely that this 38-kda organizes three 16-strand beta-barrel subunits. the relationship between the structure and the double functionality of  this protein as porin and as a root adhesin is discussed.

TI  == a novel strategy for the isolation of luxi homologues: evidence for the widespread distribution of a luxr:luxi superfamily in enteric bacteria.
AB  == the pheromone n-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (ohhl) regulates expression  of bioluminescence in the marine bacterium vibrio fischeri, the production of carbapenem antibiotic in erwinia carotovora and exoenzymes in both e. carotovora  and pseudomonas aeruginosa. a characteristic feature of this regulatory mechanism in v. fischeri is that it is cell density-dependent, reflecting the need to accumulate sufficient pheromone to trigger the induction of gene expression. using a lux plasmid-based bioluminescent sensor for ohhl, pheromone production by e. carotovora, enterobacter agglomerans, hafnia alvei, rahnella aquatilis and serratia marcescens has been demonstrated and shown also to be cell density-dependent. production of ohhl implies the presence in these bacteria of a gene equivalent to luxi. chromosomal banks from all five enteric bacteria have yielded clones capable of eliciting ohhl production when expressed in escherichia coli. the luxi homologue from both e. carotovora (cari) and e. agglomerans (eagi) were characterized at the dna sequence level and the deduced protein sequences have only 25% identity with the v. fischeri luxi. despite this, cari, eagi and luxi are shown to be biologically equivalent. an insertion mutant of eagi demonstrates that this gene is essential for ohhl production in e. agglomerans.
