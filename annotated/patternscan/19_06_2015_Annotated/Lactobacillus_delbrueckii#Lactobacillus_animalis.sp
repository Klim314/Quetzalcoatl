TI  == proteolytic and ace-inhibitory activities of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria as affected by different levels of fat, inulin and starter culture.
AB  == in this study, the effects of fat (0.5 %, 3.2 % and 5.0 %), inulin (0.0 and 1.0 %) and starter culture (0.0 %, 0.5 %, 1.0 % and 1.5 %) on the angiotensin converting enzyme (ace)-inhibitory activity of probiotic yogurt containing non-viable bacteria were assessed. proteolytic activities of bacteria were also investigated. yogurts were prepared either using a sole yogurt commercial culture including streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus or bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 and lactobacillus acidophilus la5 in addition to yogurt culture. relative degrees of proteolysis were found to be considerably higher in yogurt samples than uht milk as the control. both regular  and probiotic yogurts showed considerable ace-inhibitory activities. results showed that degree of proteolysis was not influenced by different fat contents, while was increased by high concentration of starter culture (1.5 % w/w) and reduced by inulin (1 % w/w). ace-inhibitory activities of yogurt were also negatively affected by the presence of inulin and high levels of fat (5 % w/w). moreover, yogurt containing probiotic bacteria showed higher inhibitory against ace in comparison to the yogurt prepared with non-probiotic strains.

TI  == plant extract enhances the viability of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus acidophilus in probiotic nonfat yogurt.
AB  == a commercial plant extract (prepared from olive, garlic, onion and citrus extracts with sodium acetate (sa) as a carrier) was evaluated to extend the viability of yogurt starter and probiotic bacteria as a means to enhance the shelf life of live and active culture, probiotic nonfat yogurt. yogurts prepared  from three different formulas (0.5* plant extract, 0.25* sa, or no supplement) and cultures (yogurt starter plus bifidobacterium animalis,lactobacillus acidophilus, or both probiotics) were assessed weekly during 29 days of storage at 5 degrees c. supplemented yogurt mixes had greater buffering capacities than non-supplemented yogurt mixes. at the end of storage, lactobacillus bulgaricus and l. acidophilus counts in supplemented yogurts were greater compared with non-supplemented yogurts. supplementation did not affect streptococcus thermophilus and b. animalis counts. hence the greater buffering capacity of yogurt containing plant extract could enhance the longevity of the probiotics, l. bulgaricus and l. acidophilus, during storage.

TI  == antistaphylococcal action of lacto- and bifidobacteria and interleukn-2.
AB  == antistaphylococcal action of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281, l. acidophilus lmv b-7279 and bifidobacterium animalis vkb as well as interleukin-2 (il-2) has been determined on the model of experimental staphylococcal infection in mice. it has been established that peroral administration of certain probiotic strains of lacto- and bifidobacteria or composition l. acidophilus lmv b-7279--l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus imv b-7281 with il-2 to mice favored the reducing of terms of staphylococcus persistence in the kidneys of experimental mice. the studied schemes are promising for treatment of patients with surgical infection.

TI  == effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on growth, bile survival and cholesterol uptake abilities of dairy-related bacteria.
AB  == background: three strains of lactic acid bacteria and one probiotic bifidobacterium strain sourced from milk origin were considered to select for the best synbiotic-like combination for cholesterol uptake ability. for that purpose, fermentative characteristics, bile salt hydrolase activity, bile survival and cholesterol removal were assessed in the presence of different carbohydrates. results: carbohydrate fermentability was highly variable among the different strains, and lactulose was the only prebiotic to favour growth of all strains, whereas pectin led to low population regardless of the strain. bile survival of bacteria could be improved by the preferred carbon source and was related to their bile salt hydrolase activities. all together, our results showed that the most advantageous synbiotic-like combinations to achieve cholesterol uptake abilities were lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb 340 with raffinose, streptococcus thermophilus ta040 or lactobacillus rhamnosus lbre-lsas with lactulose, and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb12 with mannitol. conclusion: the suggested synbiotics may represent new promising functional dairy additives.

TI  == effect of probiotics on the development of dimethylhydrazine-induced preneoplastic lesions in the mice colon.
AB  == purpose: to determine the effect of probiotics on the development of chemically induced (1, 2-dimethylhydrazine) colonic preneoplastic lesions, in mice. methods: the animals were divided into five groups. the control group was injected with carcinogen alone and the other groups also received probiotics (1- lactobacillus  delbrueckii ufv-h2b20; 2- bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb12; 3- l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 plus b. animalis var. lactis bb12; and 4- saccharomyces boulardii) administered orally in drinking water throughout fourteen weeks. results: consumption of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria alone resulted in a significant reduction of the total number of aberrant crypt foci (55.7% and 45.1%, respectively). significant reduction in the number of these small foci (<3 aberrant crypts) was only observed in the group treated with lactobacilli (52.2%) in comparison to control group. the number of larger foci (>3 aberrant crypts) crypts had no significant reduction. conclusion: l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 and b.  animalis var. lactis bb12 administered alone protect colonic preneoplastic lesions in mice, while the combined treatment of these bacteria and the administration of s.boulardii were not effective in reducing such colonic lesions.

TI  == development of bacteria identification array to detect lactobacilli in thai fermented sausage.
AB  == to improve the quality and safety of food products, there is a need in the food industry for a reliable method for simultaneously monitoring multiple bacterial strains. microarray technology is a high-throughput screening approach that can provide an alternative for bacteria detection. a total of 164 bacteria-specific probes were designed from 16s rrna gene sequences to target 12 bacteria species,  including lactic acid bacteria and selected food pathogens. after fabrication onto aminosilane-coated slides, hybridization conditions of the array were optimized for high specificity and signal intensities. the array was applied to detect 12 bacteria individually and was specific to all (lactobacillus plantarum  group, l. fermentum, l. brevis, l. delbrueckii, l. casei, l. sakei, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus luteus and listeria monocytogenes) except l. animalis. multiplex detection using mixed bacteria populations was evaluated and accurate detection was obtained. the feasibility of using the array to detect the target bacteria in food was evaluated with thai fermented sausages  (nham). meat samples were collected on days 2, 3 and 7 after natural fermentation, l. plantarum-inoculated fermentation and l. brevis-inoculated fermentation before applying to the array. the naturally-fermented nham contained l. sakei, l. delbrueckii, l. plantarum and l. fermentum. the l. plantarum-inoculated nham showed a similar lactic acid bacteria population but the positive signal level for l. plantarum was higher than with natural fermentation. the l. brevis-inoculated nham contained l. brevis, l. plantarum, l. delbrueckii and l. fermentum. the array was used to monitor bacteria population dynamics during the fermentation process. the naturally-fermented and l. brevis-inoculated samples showed lower positive signal levels of l. plantarum on  day 2, but signals gradually increased on days 3 and 7 of the fermentation. in contrast, the l. plantarum-started fermentation showed a higher positive signal level on day 2 than the natural and l. brevis-inoculated samples, and the positive signal level remained high on days 3 and 7. the bacteria identification  array was proven to be useful as an alternative method to detect and monitor target bacteria populations during food fermentation.

TI  == fatty acid profile, trans-octadecenoic, alpha-linolenic and conjugated linoleic acid contents differing in certified organic and conventional probiotic fermented milks.
AB  == development of dairy organic probiotic fermented products is of great interest as they associate ecological practices and benefits of probiotic bacteria. as organic management practices of cow milk production allow modification of the fatty acid composition of milk (as compared to conventional milk), we studied the influence of the type of milk on some characteristics of fermented milks, such as acidification kinetics, bacterial counts and fatty acid content. conventional and organic probiotic fermented milks were produced using bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis hn019 in co-culture with streptococcus thermophilus ta040 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lb340. the use of organic milk led to a higher acidification rate and cultivability of lactobacillus bulgaricus. fatty  acids profile of organic fermented milks showed higher amounts of trans-octadecenoic acid (c18:1, 1.6 times) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including cis-9 trans-11, c18:2 conjugated linoleic (cla-1.4 times), and alpha-linolenic acids (ala-1.6 times), as compared to conventional fermented milks. these higher levels were the result of both initial percentage in the milk and increase during acidification, with no further modification during storage. finally, use of bifidobacteria slightly increased cla relative content in the conventional fermented milks, after 7 days of storage at 4 degrees c, whereas no  difference was seen in organic fermented milks.

TI  == rapid and accurate bacterial identification in probiotics and yoghurts by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == probiotic food is manufactured by adding probiotic strains simultaneously with starter cultures in fermentation tanks. here, we investigate the accuracy and feasibility of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for bacterial identification at the species level in  probiotic food and yoghurts. probiotic food and yoghurts were cultured in columbia and lactobacillus specific agar and tested by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) for the detection and quantification of lactobacillus sp. bacterial identification was performed by maldi-tof analysis and by amplification and sequencing of tuf and 16s rdna genes. we tested 13 probiotic food and yoghurts and we identified by qpcr that they presented 10(6) to 10(7) copies of lactobacillus spp. dna/g. all products contained very large numbers of living bacteria varying from 10(6) to 10(9) colony forming units/g. these bacteria were  identified as lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, bifidobacterium animalis,  lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus. maldi-tof ms presented 92% specificity compared to the molecular assays. in one product we found l. lactis, instead of bifidus spp. which was mentioned on the label and for another  l. delbrueckii and s. thermophilus instead of bifidus spp. maldi-tof ms allows a  rapid and accurate bacterial identification at the species level in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified. practical application: maldi-tof ms is rapid and specific for the identification of bacteria in probiotic food and yoghurts. although the safety and functionality of probiotics  are species and strain dependent, we found a discrepancy between the bacterial strain announced on the label and the strain identified.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == effect of kynurenic acid on the viability of probiotics in vitro.
AB  == probiotics are bacteria that are commercially available as dietary supplements. one of the important properties of probiotics is their ability to survive in the  intestine. recent evidence has identified kynurenic acid (kyna) as a bactericidal constituent of intestinal fluid. these data led us to study the influence of kyna on the viability of selected probiotics. we found that kyna supported the growth  of bacteria in the probiotics acidolac (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium) and lakcid forte (lactobacillus rhamnosus) or retarded the growth of bacteria from the acidolac, biogaia (lactobacillus reuteri protectis),  dicoflor (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg), lacium (lactobacillus plantarum) and trilac (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) probiotics depending on its concentration. kyna did not affect the viability of bacteria from the probiotic linex (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12). our results suggest a potential role of kyna in the regulation of bacterial growth in the digestive system.

TI  == impact of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis bb-12 and, lactobacillus acidophilus la-5-containing yoghurt, on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults.
AB  == this randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel dose-response study investigated the impact of 4-week commercial yoghurt consumption supplemented with bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (bb-12) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la-5) on fecal bacterial counts of healthy adults. fifty-eight volunteers were randomly assigned to three different groups: 1. placebo (no probiotic, no starter and no green tea extract); 2. yoptimal (10(9)cfu/100g of bb-12 and la-5 and 40mg  of green tea extract) and 3. yoptimal-10 (10(10)cfu/100g of bb-12, 10(9)cfu/100g  of la-5 and 40mg of green tea extract). these yoghurt products also contained lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (10(7)cfu/100g) and streptococcus thermophilus (10(10)cfu/100g). the quantitative pcr (qpcr) results showed that there were significant increases (p=0.02) in bifidobacteria counts with the yoptimal treatment as compared to baseline. the fecal numbers of b. animalis subsp. lactis and la-5 significantly increased in the two probiotic treatments compared to the placebo treatment. viable counts of fecal lactobacilli were significantly higher (p=0.05) and those of enterococci were significantly lower (p=0.04) after the intervention when compared to placebo. no significant difference was observed between treatments in volunteers' weight, waist girth, blood pressure, fasting plasma triglyceride and hdl-c concentrations, as well as  cholesterol/hdl-cholesterol ratio. however, a significant increase in plasma cholesterol levels was observed in the placebo group (p=0.0018) but the levels remained stable in the two probiotic yoghurt groups. these results show that probiotic strains supplemented in the form of yoghurt remain active during gut transit and are associated with an increase in beneficial bacteria and a reduction in potentially pathogenic bacteria. this trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as nct00730626.

TI  == beneficial effects of a synbiotic supplement on self-perceived gastrointestinal well-being and immunoinflammatory status of healthy adults.
AB  == the use of synbiotics as health promoters is still poorly defined, and human intervention studies are scarce. this study was designed to evaluate the effects  of a commercialized synbiotic product containing lactobacillus acidophilus la5, bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis bb-12, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and fructooligosaccharides on the self-reported gastrointestinal well-being and the immunoinflammatory status of healthy human subjects. in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 20 women and 16 men (25-45 years old) received either three tablets per day of the synbiotic product (2.4 x 10(9) colony-forming units/day) or placebo during 6 weeks. gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habits were evaluated through a self-administered questionnaire. in those subjects suffering from any kind of digestive disturbance (mild dyspepsia,  flatulence, postprandial bloating, constipation, etc.), improvements in symptoms  after product consumption were also evaluated. blood lymphocyte subsets, phagocytic activity, serum c-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin, and adhesion molecules concentrations were analyzed prior and after treatment. a significant improvement in overall self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms and bowel habit was found in the synbiotic group. a marginal effect of treatment (analysis of variance p = .050) was observed with l-selectin, which showed a significant decrease in the synbiotic group (p = .019). in addition, basal l-selectin levels  correlated with final intercellular adhesion molecule (icam)-1 levels (r = 0.468; p = .050), and basal icam-1 levels tended to correlate negatively with final l-selectin concentration (r = -0.457; p = .056). none of these correlations was found in the placebo group. the rest of the immunological parameters studied were not modified by the intervention. in conclusion, consumption of the synbiotic product improves self-perceived bowel habits and might facilitate a better profile of adhesion molecules in healthy adults.

TI  == impact of probiotic supplementation on mortality of induced 1,2-dimethylhydrazine carcinogenesis in a mouse model.
AB  == rationale: probiotic bacterial strains have been increasingly used in clinical practice as many health benefits result from their use. however, severe side effects such as bacteremia and fungemia have been reported in inmunocompromised patients and those with chronic disease. objective: the purpose of this study was to report the impact of probiotic supplementation on the mortality of mice undergoing carcinogenesis induction with 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (dmh). methods: two treatment protocols were used. in experiment 1, lactobacillus delbrueckii ufv-h2b20, bifidobacterium animalis var. lactis bb12, and saccharomyces boulardii were added to the drinking water, to control mice and those undergoing injections of dmh daily. probiotic supplementation was started 1 wk before and continued throughout the 6 wk of dmh injections. in experiment 2, the same probiotics were  administered daily, except on the first day that dmh was administered. the mortality of these animals was recorded. bacterial translocation was determined in mice in experiment 1. results: groups with dmh-induced injury treated with lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and the mixture of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria  presented with 40%, 30%, and 60% mortality, respectively. death happened mainly between 48 h and 72 h after the first injection of dmh. on the other hand, no mice in experiment 2 died during the study period. bacteria were found to be translocated to mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. conclusion: supplementation of l. delbrueckii ufv-h2b20 and b. animalis var. lactis bb12 in mice with dmh-induced injury led to death in some animals. the results suggest that increased bacterial translocation was probably related to mortality. these findings are an alert to the potentially severe side effects associated with the  use of probiotics under extremely stressful situations.

TI  == [probiotic properties of industrial strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria].
AB  == lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from the samples of dry microbial substance "vivolac" and identified. the lactic acid bacteria were identified as lactobacillus acidophilus. l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. paracasei. bifidobacteria belonged to the species bifidobacterium animalis. manifestation of biological activity of all studied strains was investigated. it  was shown, that adhesive activity of the studied strains depended on the genus of the strain: lactobacilli manifested medium adhesiveness to buccal epithelium (medium adhesive index 2.07-2.26), bifidobacteria manifested high adhesiveness (medium adhesive index 4.11-4.76). antagonism against pathogenic and opportunistic reference strains was manifested to a greater extent to pseudomonas aeruginosa. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were resistant to aminoglycosides. sensitivity of the studied strains to antibiotics did not depend on the genus and species of microorganism. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium strains were capable  to survive in gastric juice and at different concentration of bile, which is promising for development of probiotic preparations on the basis of these strains.

TI  == dynamics of fecal microbiota in hospitalized elderly fed probiotic lkm512 yogurt.
AB  == the comprehensive dynamics of intestinal microbiota including uncultured bacteria in response to probiotic consumption have not been well studied. the aims of this study were twofold: firstly to analyze the impact on intestinal microbiota of yogurt fermented by bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis lkm512, lactobacillus  delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus lkm1759, and streptococcus thermophilus lkm1742 (lkm512 yogurt) and placebo fermented by these lactic acid bacterial strains without lkm512; and secondly to investigate the changes in intestinal microbiota  that influence the concentration of pa, one of the beneficial metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestine. the lkm512 yogurt/placebo trial was performed in six hospitalized elderly patients (three men and three women with an average age of 80.3 years) and lasted seven weeks with the following schedule: pre-consumption for one week, lkm512 yogurt consumption for two weeks, washout period for two weeks, and placebo consumption for two weeks. the amount of ingested lkm512 yogurt or placebo was 100 g/day/individual. fecal samples were analyzed using t-rflp and real-time pcr. the t-rflp patterns in five of the six volunteers were changed in a similar fashion by lkm512 yogurt consumption, although these patterns were individually changed following consumption of placebo. it was confirmed that b. animalis subsp. lactis was increased dramatically and lactobacillus spp. tended to be decreased by lkm512 yogurt consumption. some indigenous uncultured bacteria were increased and some decreased by lkm512 yogurt/placebo consumption. the similar changes in the intestinal microbiota of the elderly caused by consumption of the lkm512 yogurt were found to be influenced by the lkm512 strain itself, and not by the lactic acid bacteria in the yogurt. moreover, this study suggests that the increase in intestinal pa concentrations caused by lkm512 yogurt consumption is probably dependent on the lkm512 strain colonizing the intestine.

TI  == effects of fructooligosaccharide and whey protein concentrate on the viability of starter culture in reduced-fat probiotic yogurt during storage.
AB  == viability of yogurt starter cultures and bifidobacterium animalis was assessed during 28 d storage in reduced-fat yogurts containing 1.5% milk fat supplemented  with 1.5% fructooligosaccharide or whey protein concentrate. these properties were examined in comparison with control yogurts containing 1.5% and 3% milk fat  and no supplement. although fructooligosaccharide improved the viability of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus, and bifidobacterium animalis, the highest growth was obtained when milk was supplemented with whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt (p < 0.05). supplementation with 1.5% whey protein concentrate in reduced-fat yogurt increased the viable counts of s. thermophilus, l. delbrueckii subs. bulgaricus,  and b. animalis by 1 log cycle in the 1st week of storage when compared to control sample. similar improvement in the growth of both yogurt bacteria and b.  animalis was also obtained in the full-fat yogurt containing 3% milk fat and no supplement. addition of whey protein concentrate also resulted in the highest content of lactic and acetic acids (p < 0.05). a gradual increase was obtained in organic acid contents during the storage.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacterium spp. isolated from dairy and pharmaceutical products.
AB  == the outlines of antibiotic resistance of some probiotic microorganisms were studied. this study was conducted with the double purpose of verifying their ability to survive if they are taken simultaneously with an antibiotic therapy and to increase the selective properties of suitable media for the isolation of samples containing mixed bacterial populations. we isolated from commercial dairy and pharmaceutical products, 34 strains declared as probiotics, belonging to the  genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, and 21 strains of starter culture bacteria. all the microorganisms have been compared by electrophoresis of the soluble proteins for the purpose of identifying them. a multiplex-pcr with genus- and species-specific primers was used to detect for bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis presence. all bifidobacteria were b. animalis subsp. lactis except  one bifidobacterium longum. sometimes the identification showed that the used strain was not the one indicated on the label. the lactobacilli were lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. the streptococci were all streptococcus thermophilus. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 24 common antibiotic substances has been valued by the broth microdilution method. all tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin, bacitracin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, erytromycin, novobiocin, penicillin g, rifampicin (mic(90) ranging from 0.01 to 4 microg/ml);  resistant to aztreonam, cycloserin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, polymyxin b and spectinomycin (mic(90) ranging from 64 to >1000 microg/ml). the susceptibility to cephalothin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, lincomycin, metronidazole, neomycin, paromomycin, streptomycin, tetracycline and vancomycin was variable and depending on the species.

TI  == identification and differentiation of lactobacillus, streptococcus and bifidobacterium species in fermented milk products with bifidobacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to identify and discriminate bacteria contained in commercial fermented milks with bifidobacteria by the use of amplified ribosomal  dna restriction analysis (ardra) and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) techniques. ardra of the 16s rdna gene and rapd were performed on 13 lactobacillus strains, 13 streptococcus and 13 bifidobacterium strains isolated from commercial fermented milk. lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium animalis isolates were identified by genus- and  species-pcr and also, they were differentiated at genus and species level by ardra using mwoi restriction enzyme. the ardra technique allowed for the discrimination among these three related genus with the use of only one restriction enzyme, since distinctive profiles were obtained for each genus. therefore it can be a simple, rapid and useful method for routine identification. also, rapd technique allowed the discrimination of all bacteria contained in dairy products, at genus- and strain-level by the performance of one pcr reaction.

TI  == synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  == thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. the organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococcus faecium. folate was synthesised by s. thermophilus, bifidobacteria,  and e. faecium. s. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). generally,  lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was  additive. fermentations using a combination of bifidobacterium animalis and s. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low  in terms of recommended daily allowance.
