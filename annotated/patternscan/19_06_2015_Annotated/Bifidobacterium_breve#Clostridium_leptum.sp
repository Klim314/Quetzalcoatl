TI  == molecular monitoring of the development of intestinal microbiota in japanese infants.
AB  == the faecal microbiota of 166 healthy japanese newborns was analysed periodically  from day 1 after birth until the age of 3 years by using the reverse transcription-quantitative pcr. faecal ph and the organic acid concentration were also examined. colonisation by both facultative anaerobes and strict anaerobes was confirmed in 95% of the meconium tested. bifidobacterium-predominant microbiota was established subsequently in most of the infants by 3 months after  birth. bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium catenulatum group and bifidobacterium bifidum were the species mainly detected. intergroup correlation analysis revealed that the bifidobacterial population levels, but not other strict anaerobe groups, were found to be negatively correlated with those of the enterobacteriaceae from 7 days until 3 months after birth. faecal ph was maintained at about 6 until 6 months after birth and reached 6.6 at 3 years after birth. the initial concentration of faecal organic acids (19 mum/g of faeces) just after birth increased until 3 years after birth to the level of 111 mum/g of faeces. early start of feeding formula milk promoted colonisation by obligate anaerobes such as the clostridium coccoides group, the clostridium leptum subgroup, prevotella, and atopobium cluster during the 3 months after birth. population levels of the bifidobacteria until 1 month after birth and those of the bacteroides fragilis group until 6 months after birth were lower in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered normally. the results suggested that both earlier start of feeding of formula milk and the mode of infant delivery were found to be important in the development of intestinal microbiota in early infancy.

TI  == interplay between weight loss and gut microbiota composition in overweight adolescents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of an obesity treatment program on the gut microbiota and body weight of overweight adolescents. thirty-six adolescents (13-15 years), classified as overweight according to the international obesity task force bmi criteria, were submitted to a calorie-restricted diet (10-40%) and increased physical activity (15-23 kcal/kg body weight/week) program over 10 weeks. gut bacterial groups were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr before and after the intervention. a group of subjects (n=23) experienced >4.0 kg weight loss and showed significant bmi (p=0.030) and bmi z-score (p=0.035) reductions after the intervention, while the other group (n=13) showed <2.0 kg weight loss. no significant differences in dietary intake were found between both groups. in the whole adolescent population, the intervention led to increased bacteroides fragilis group (p=0.001) and lactobacillus group (p=0.030) counts, and to decreased clostridium coccoides group (p=0.028), bifidobacterium longum (p=0.031), and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p=0.044) counts. in the high weight-loss group, b. fragilis group and lactobacillus group counts also increased (p=0.001 and p=0.007, respectively), whereas c. coccoides group and b. longum counts decreased (p=0.001 and p=0.044, respectively) after the intervention. total bacteria, b. fragilis group and clostridium leptum group, and bifidobacterium catenulatum group counts  were significantly higher (p<0.001-0.036) while levels of c. coccoides group, lactobacillus group, bifidobacterium, bifidobacterium breve, and bifidobacterium  bifidum were significantly lower (p<0.001-0.008) in the high weight-loss group than in the low weight-loss group before and after the intervention. these findings indicate that calorie restriction and physical activity have an impact on gut microbiota composition related to body weight loss, which also seem to be  influenced by the individual's microbiota.
