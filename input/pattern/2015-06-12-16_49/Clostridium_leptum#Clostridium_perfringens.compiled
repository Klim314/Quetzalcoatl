TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Characterization of the gut microbiota of Papua New Guineans using reverse transcription quantitative PCR.
AB  - There has been considerable interest in composition of gut microbiota in recent years, leading to a better understanding of the role the gut microbiota plays in health and disease. Most studies have been limited in their geographical and socioeconomic diversity to high-income settings, and have been conducted using small sample sizes. To date, few analyses have been conducted in low-income settings, where a better understanding of the gut microbiome could lead to the greatest return in terms of health benefits. Here, we have used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting dominant and sub-dominant groups of microorganisms associated with human gut microbiome in 115 people living a subsistence lifestyle in rural areas of Papua New Guinea. Quantification of Clostridium coccoides group, C. leptum subgroup, C. perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis group, Bifidobacterium, Atopobium cluster, Prevotella, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Lactobacillus spp. was conducted. Principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed two dimensions with Prevotella, clostridia, Atopobium, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus grouping in one dimension, while B. fragilis, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus grouping in the second dimension. Highland people had higher numbers of most groups of bacteria detected, and this is likely a key factor for the differences revealed by PCoA between highland and lowland study participants. Age and sex were not major determinants in microbial population composition. The study demonstrates a gut microbial composition with some similarities to those observed in other low-income settings where traditional diets are consumed, which have previously been suggested to favor energy extraction from a carbohydrate rich diet.
TI  - Cytokine response of human mononuclear cells induced by intestinal Clostridium species.
AB  - Altered composition of intestinal microbiota has been associated with various immunological disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Although Clostridium species are major inhabitants of the intestinal tract, their interaction with the host immunological system is yet poorly characterized. In this study, cytokine responses of human monocytic cell line THP-1 and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to six type strains representing common intestinal clostridial species were determined. The strains induced diverse cytokine responses in both THP-1 cells and PBMC. Clostridium perfringens was the most potent inducer of both tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), as compared to Clostridium histolyticum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium sporosphaeroides and Blautia coccoides. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in PBMC was most efficiently stimulated by C. sporosphaeroides. The same PBMC preparations that responded strongly to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also responded strongly to bacterial stimulation. This indicates that the level of responsiveness is an individual feature of mononuclear cell preparations, and that the overall cytokine response is composed by a combination of host factors and microbial structures affecting them. This work supports the idea that the composition of the intestinal clostridial population influences immune responses and is likely to play an important role in intestinal homeostasis.
TI  - Chicken intestine microbiota following the administration of lupulone, a hop-based antimicrobial.
AB  - The use of antibiotic growth promotants in poultry rearing is a public health concern due to antibiotic resistance in bacteria and the harborage of resistance genes. Lupulone, a hop beta-acid from Humulus lupulus, has been considered as a potential feed additive growth promotant. Here, the effect of lupulone was evaluated for its effect on the microbiota of the chicken intestine. The intestinal microbiota of broilers was quantified after the addition of 125 mg L(-1) lupulone to water and challenge with Clostridium perfringens. Microbial DNA was extracted from the broiler midgut and cecal sections and bacterial groups were quantified using real-time PCR. The predominant cecal bacterial groups were Clostridium leptum subgroup 16S rRNA gene Cluster IV, Clostridium coccoides subgroup 16S rRNA gene Clusters XIVa and XIVb and Bacteroides, whereas Lactobacillus, the Enterobacteriaceae family and Enterococcus dominated the midgut. Lupulone at 125 mg L(-1) significantly decreased the C. perfringens subgroup 16S rRNA gene Cluster I, which contains several pathogenic species, in both the midgut and the cecum and Lactobacillus in the midgut. No significant changes were noted in the overall microbiota for the cecum or the midgut. Lupulone warrants further evaluation as a botanical agent to mitigate C. perfringens overgrowth in antibiotic-free reared poultry.
TI  - Determinants of the human infant intestinal microbiota after the introduction of  first complementary foods in infant samples from five European centres.
AB  - Although it is well established that early infant feeding has a major influence on the establishment of the gut microbiota, very little is understood about how the introduction of first solid food influences the colonization process. This study aimed to determine the impact of weaning on the faecal microbiota composition of infants from five European countries (Sweden, Scotland, Germany, Italy and Spain) which have different lifestyle characteristics and infant feeding practices. Faecal samples were collected from 605 infants approximately 4 weeks after the introduction of first solid foods and the results were compared with the same infants before weaning (6 weeks of age) to investigate the association with determining factors such as geographical origin, mode of delivery, previous feeding method and age of weaning. Samples were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry using a panel of 10 rRNA targeted group- and species-specific oligonucleotide probes. The genus Bifidobacterium (36.5 % average proportion of total detectable bacteria), Clostridium coccoides group (14 %) and Bacteroides (13.6 %) were predominant after weaning. Similar to pre-weaning, northern European countries were associated with a higher proportion of bifidobacteria in the infant gut microbiota while higher levels of Bacteroides and lactobacilli characterized southern European countries. As before weaning, the initial feeding method influenced the Clostridium leptum group and Clostridium difficile+Clostridium perfringens species, and bifidobacteria still dominated the faeces of initially breast-fed infants. Formula-fed babies presented significantly higher proportions of Bacteroides and the C. coccoides group. The mode of birth influenced changes in the proportions of bacteroides and atopobium. Although there were significant differences in the mean weaning age between countries, this was not related to the populations of bifidobacteria or bacteroides. Thus, although the faecal microbiota of infants after first complementary foods was different to that before weaning commenced, many of the initial influences on microbiota composition were still evident.
TI  - Establishment of an analytical system for the human fecal microbiota, based on reverse transcription-quantitative PCR targeting of multicopy rRNA molecules.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was established for the precise evaluation of human intestinal microbiota. Group- and species-specific primer sets for Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp. (six subgroups and three species), Enterococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. targeting 16S rRNA gene sequences were newly developed for the quantitative analysis of such subdominant populations in human intestines. They were used together with previously reported group-specific primer sets for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and six predominant bacterial groups (the Clostridium coccoides group, the Clostridium leptum subgroup, the Bacteroides fragilis group, Bifidobacterium spp., the Atopobium cluster, and Prevotella spp.) for the examination of fecal samples from 40 healthy adults by RT-qPCR with lower detection limits of 10(2) to 10(4) cells per g of feces. The RT-qPCR method gave data equivalent to those yielded by qPCR for predominant populations of more than 10(8) cells per g of feces and could quantify bacterial populations that were not detectable (Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas) or those only detected at lower incidences (Prevotella, C. perfringens, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus) by qPCR or the culture method. The RT-qPCR analysis of Lactobacillus spp. at the subgroup level revealed that a subject has a mean of 4.6 subgroups, with an average count of log(10)(6.3 +/- 1.5) cells per g of feces. These results suggest that RT-qPCR is effective for the accurate enumeration of human intestinal microbiota, especially the entire analysis of both predominant and subdominant populations.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of the intestinal bacterial community in one- to three-week-old commercially reared broiler chickens fed conventional or antibiotic-free vegetable-based diets.
AB  - AIMS: To explore the effect of drug-free poultry production on the intestinal microflora of broiler chickens, the bacterial community of this environment was quantitatively profiled in both conventionally reared birds and birds reared without antibiotic growth promotants (AGPs) on a vegetable-based diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative, real-time PCR with group-specific 16S rDNA primer sets was used to enumerate the abundance of the following chicken gastrointestinal (GI) tract phylogenetic groups: the Clostridium leptum-Faecalibacterium prausnitzii subgroup (Clostridium genus cluster IV), the Clostridium coccoides - Eubacterium rectale subgroup (Clostridium cluster XIVa and XIVb), the Bacteroides group (including Prevotella and Porphyromonas), Bifidobacterium spp., the Enterobacteriaceae, the Lactobacillus group (including the genera Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Aerococcus and Weissella), the Clostridium perfringens subgroup (Clostridium cluster I), Enterococcus spp., Veillonella spp., Atopobium spp., Campylobacter spp. and the domain Bacteria. A species-specific 5'-nuclease (Taqman) assay was also employed to specifically assess Cl. perfringens abundance. Ten birds were sampled from each of two commercial chicken houses, one in which feed was supplemented with AGPs and exogenous animal protein, and the other vegetable-based and drug-free, at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. The ileal community was dominated by two large populations, the lactobacilli and the Enterobacteriaceae, with those taxa much more numerous in drug-free vegetable-based diet fed birds than those conventionally reared at the 7- and 14-day time periods. The progressive changes in microflora in both the conventional and drug-free caeca were similar to each other, with the Enterobacteriaceae sequences dominating at day 7, but being replaced by obligate anaerobe signature sequences by day 14. Of note was the finding that all the day 14 and day 21 replicate caecal samples from the drug-free house were positive for Campylobacter spp. averaging >10(8) 16S rDNA gene copies per gram wet weight. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative, real-time PCR indicates that the effects of drug-free rearing on the chicken GI tract microbial community are most pronounced in the ileal region, but AGPs may be important in controlling Campylobacter colonization of the caecum. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A quantitative taxonomic understanding of the shifting microbial ecology of the broiler chicken gut microbiota is important in the light of AGP withdrawal. AGP withdrawal has occurred in response to concerns over the transfer of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria to humans via the food production chain.
TI  - Identification of predominant human and animal anaerobic intestinal bacterial species by terminal restriction fragment patterns (TRFPs): a rapid, PCR-based method.
AB  - Identification of predominant human and animal intestinal tract anaerobes by conventional methods is cumbersome, time-consuming and less sensitive as compared to molecular methods. We have developed a molecular technique to identify most of the abundant intestinal microflora by polyermase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a 16S rRNA gene fragment using a pair of universal PCR primers. The forward PCR primer was labelled with 6-carboxyfluorescein amino hexy (6-FAM) fluorescent dye to detect the terminal fragment of the PCR products after digestion with restriction enzymes. The PCR products were purified and digested with restriction enzymes and were analysed by capillary electrophoresis using an automated DNA sequencer. The data was analysed with GeneScan software 2.1. Eleven bacteria (Eubacterium biforme, E. limosum, Peptostreptococcus productus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, C. perfringens and Escherichia coli) that are predominant in human and animal intestinal tract were successfully identified by this rapid molecular technique. This protocol is rapid, accurate, sensitive and capable of identifying multiple organisms in a single sample.
TI  - Isolation of nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants of nitroreductase-producing Clostridium sp. strains from the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of Clostridium leptum, Clostridium paraputrificum, two other Clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. All of the Clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. The nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. At least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible Bacillus sp. strain. Nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. This study indicates that Clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.
TI  - The use of PCR to monitor the population abundance of six human intestinal bacterial species in an in vitro semicontinuous culture system.
AB  - Six PCR primer sets complementary to the 16S rDNAs (rRNA genes) were developed and shown to be specific for the following anaerobic bacteria: Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. perfringens, C. leptum, Bacteroides vulgatus, B. distasonis, and B. thetaiotaomicron, respectively. These primers were used for PCR to detect and monitor the bacteria in a semicontinuous culture system designed to mimic intestinal microflora in the human gastrointestinal tract. Except for C. perfringens, the five species of Bacteroides and Clostridia present in the in vitro culture system were detected by the PCR, and the titers varied from 10(-2) to 10(-6) dilutions. The role of azo dye reduction by these bacterial species in the system was examined and discussed.
