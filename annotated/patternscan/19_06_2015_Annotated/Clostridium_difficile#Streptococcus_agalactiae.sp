TI  == influence of sequence mismatches on the specificity of recombinase polymerase amplification technology.
AB  == recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) technology relies on three major proteins, recombinase proteins, single-strand binding proteins, and polymerases,  to specifically amplify nucleic acid sequences in an isothermal format. the performance of rpa with respect to sequence mismatches of closely-related non-target molecules is not well documented and the influence of the number and distribution of mismatches in dna sequences on rpa amplification reaction is not  well understood. we investigated the specificity of rpa by testing closely-related species bearing naturally occurring mismatches for the tuf gene sequence of pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or mycobacterium tuberculosis and for the  cfb gene sequence of streptococcus agalactiae. in addition, the impact of the number and distribution of mismatches on rpa efficiency was assessed by synthetically generating 14 types of mismatched forward primers for detecting five bacterial species of high diagnostic relevance such as clostridium difficile, staphylococcus aureus, s. agalactiae, p. aeruginosa, and m. tuberculosis as well as bacillus atropheus subsp. globigii for which we use the spores as internal control in diagnostic assays. a total of 87 mismatched primers were tested in this study. we observed that target specific rpa primers with mismatches (n > 1) at their 3'extrimity hampered rpa reaction. in addition, 3 mismatches covering both extremities and the center of the primer sequence negatively affected rpa yield. we demonstrated that the specificity of rpa was multifactorial. therefore its application in clinical settings must be selected and validated a priori. we recommend that the selection of a target gene must consider the presence of closely-related non-target genes. it is advisable to choose target regions with a high number of mismatches (>/=36%, relative to the size of amplicon) with respect to closely-related species and the best case scenario would be by choosing a unique target gene.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of azd0914, a new spiropyrimidinetrione dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent activity against gram-positive, fastidious gram-negative, and atypical bacteria.
AB  == azd0914 is a new spiropyrimidinetrione bacterial dna gyrase/topoisomerase inhibitor with potent in vitro antibacterial activity against key gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae), fastidious gram-negative (haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae), atypical (legionella pneumophila), and anaerobic (clostridium difficile) bacterial species, including  isolates with known resistance to fluoroquinolones. azd0914 works via inhibition  of dna biosynthesis and accumulation of double-strand cleavages; this mechanism of inhibition differs from those of other marketed antibacterial compounds. azd0914 stabilizes and arrests the cleaved covalent complex of gyrase with double-strand broken dna under permissive conditions and thus blocks religation of the double-strand cleaved dna to form fused circular dna. whereas this mechanism is similar to that seen with fluoroquinolones, it is mechanistically distinct. azd0914 exhibited low frequencies of spontaneous resistance in s. aureus, and if mutants were obtained, the mutations mapped to gyrb. additionally, no cross-resistance was observed for azd0914 against recent bacterial clinical isolates demonstrating resistance to fluoroquinolones or other drug classes, including macrolides, beta-lactams, glycopeptides, and oxazolidinones. azd0914 was bactericidal in both minimum bactericidal concentration and in vitro time-kill studies. in in vitro checkerboard/synergy testing with 17 comparator antibacterials, only additivity/indifference was observed. the potent in vitro antibacterial activity (including activity against fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates), low frequency of resistance, lack of cross-resistance, and bactericidal activity of azd0914 support its continued development.

TI  == establishing a list of qualifying pathogens under the food and drug administration safety and innovation act. final rule.
AB  == the food and drug administration (fda or agency) is issuing a regulation to establish a list of "qualifying pathogens'' that have the potential to pose a serious threat to public health. this final rule implements a provision of the generating antibiotic incentives now (gain) title of the food and drug administration safety and innovation act (fdasia). gain is intended to encourage  development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections, and provides incentives such as eligibility for designation as a fast-track product and an additional 5 years of  exclusivity to be added to certain exclusivity periods. based on analyses conducted both in the proposed rule and in response to comments to the proposed rule, fda has determined that the following pathogens comprise the list of ``qualifying pathogens:'' acinetobacter species, aspergillus species, burkholderia cepacia complex, campylobacter species, candida species, clostridium difficile, coccidioides species, cryptococcus species, enterobacteriaceae (e.g.,  klebsiella pneumoniae), enterococcus species, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium  tuberculosis complex, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria species, pseudomonas species, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, and vibrio cholerae. the preamble to the  proposed rule described the factors the agency considered and the methodology used to develop the list of qualifying pathogens. as described in the preamble of this final rule, fda applied those factors and that methodology to additional pathogens suggested via comments on the proposed rule.

TI  == rac1, rhoa, and cdc42 participate in hela cell invasion by group b streptococcus.
AB  == the group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important human pathogen with the ability to cause invasive disease. to do so, the bacteria must invade host cells. it has  been well documented that gbs are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host  cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. while some of the molecular aspects of the gbs-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. the objective  of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the rho-family gtpases rac, rho, and cdc42 in gbs invasion into epithelial cells. the epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using hela 229 cell culture. treatment of hela cells with 10 microm compactin, a pan-gtpase inhibitor, abolished gbs internalization,  suggesting that gtpases are involved in the gbs invasion process. the addition of toxin b or exoenzyme c3 to hela cells before gbs infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the rho-family gtpases are involved in gbs entry. examining invasion of gbs into hela cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; gbs invasion into hela cells transiently transfected with dominant negative rac1, cdc42, or rhoa reduced invasion by 75%,  51%, and 42%, respectively. results of this study suggest that the rho-family gtpases are required for efficient invasion of hela cells by gbs.

TI  == alpha c protein of group b streptococcus binds host cell surface glycosaminoglycan and enters cells by an actin-dependent mechanism.
AB  == group b streptococcus (gbs) colonizes mucosal surfaces of the human gastrointestinal and gynecological tracts and causes disease in a wide range of patients. invasive illness occurs after organisms traverse an epithelial boundary and enter deeper tissues. previously we have reported that the alpha c protein (acp) on the surface of gbs mediates gbs entry into me180 cervical epithelial cells and gbs translocation across layers of these cells. we now demonstrate that acp interacts with host cell glycosaminoglycan (gag); the interaction of acp with me180 cells is inhibited if cells are pretreated with sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of sulfate incorporation, or with heparitinases. the interaction is also inhibited in the presence of soluble heparin or heparan sulfate or host cell-derived gag. in addition, acp binds soluble heparin specifically in inhibition and dot blot assays. after interaction with host gag, soluble acp enters me180 cells and fractionates to the eukaryotic cell cytosol. these events  are inhibited in cells pretreated with cytochalasin d or with clostridium difficile toxin b. these data indicate that full-length acp interacts with me180  cell gag and enters the eukaryotic cell cytosol by a mechanism that involves rho  gtpase-dependent actin rearrangements. we suggest that these molecular interactions drive acp-mediated translocation of gbs across epithelial barriers,  thereby facilitating invasive gbs infection.

TI  == molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pre25 of enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  == plasmid pre25 from enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to e. faecalis jh2-2, lactococcus lactis bu2, and listeria innocua l19. its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the  largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (plasmid 46 (2001) 170). the gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pip501 of streptococcus agalactiae. erythromycin resistance is due to a 23s ribosomal rna methyl transferase, again as found in pip501 (ermb). the aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon tn5405 of staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae, s. aureus, campylobacter coli, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium difficile. pre25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pip501. of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsb, trac, trsf, trsj, and trsl). the enterococcal part is joined into the pip501 part by insertion elements is1216v of e. faecium tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of is1062 (e. faecalis) and is1485 (e. faecium). pre25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == in vitro activity of flomoxef in comparison to other cephalosporins.
AB  == flomoxef and cefazolin had nearly the same activity against staphylococci, which  was stronger than that of other cephalosporins. against streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae, cefotaxime and cefazolin were more active than flomoxef, but the other cephamycins were less active than flomoxef. in comparison to the other cephalosporins, latamoxef and flomoxef had higher activity against branhamella catarrhalis, whereas cefotaxime, latamoxef and cefotetan were more active against haemophilus influenzae. flomoxef was the only drug exhibiting activity against clostridium difficile. the activity of flomoxef and latamoxef against bacteroides fragilis was stronger than that of the other cephalosporins, but bacteroides bivius was resistant to each of these antibiotics.
