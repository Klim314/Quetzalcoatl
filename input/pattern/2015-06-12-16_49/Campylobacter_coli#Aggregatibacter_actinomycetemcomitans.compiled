TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from Haemophilus ducreyi, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested. The findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of CDT-host interactions.
TI  - Prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin production in periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a newly identified virulence factor produced by several pathogenic bacteria implicated in chronic infection. Seventy three strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria were examined for the production of CDT by a HeLa cell bioassay and for the presence of the cdt gene by PCR with degenerative oligonucleotide primers, which were designed based on various regions of the Escherichia coli and Campylobacter cdtB genes, which have been successfully used for the identification and cloning of cdtABC genes from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans Y4 (M. Sugai et al., Infect. Immun. 66:5008-5019, 1998). CDT activity was found in culture supernatants of 40 of 45 tested A. actinomycetemcomintans strains, but the titer of the toxin varied considerably among these strains. PCR experiments indicated the presence of Y4-type cdt sequences in these strains, but the rest of A. actinomycetemcomitans were negative by PCR amplification and also by Southern blot analysis for the cdtABC gene. In the 40 CDT-positive strains, Southern hybridization with HindIII-digested genomic DNA revealed that there are at least 6 restriction fragment length polymorphism types. This suggests that the cdtABC flanking region is highly polymorphic, which may partly explain the variability of the CDT activity in the culture supernatants. The rest of tested strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria did not have detectable CDT production by the HeLa cell assay and for cdtB sequences by PCR analysis under our experimental conditions. These results strongly suggested that CDT is a unique toxin predominantly produced by A. actinomycetemcomitans among periodontopathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) operon in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the CdtB protein is responsible for G2 arrest of the cell cycle in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtB gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we report that the cdt locus in A. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, Y4, 29522, and HK1651. There is also strong homology with the Cdt proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (29-48%). Analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans mRNA by RT-PCR suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdtA are coexpressed with cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. We next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. Cell extracts of E. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce G2 arrest in the cell cycle of PHA-activated human T cells. These experiments suggest that expression of cdtB alone is sufficient to induce G2 arrest in human T cells, but do not exclude the possibility that cdtC also contributes to cell cycle arrest. The implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual Cdt proteins are discussed.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a G2 arrest in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (ISF) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by perturbing cell cycle progression. We now report that ISF is the product of the cdtB gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt). The ISF polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with Hemophilus ducreyi CdtB protein and </=60% homology with Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni CdtB. Pretreatment of PHA-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng ISF results in G2 arrest of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells results in G2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. However, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to ISF than HeLa cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of Cdts with cell lines. ISF-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin A and B1 levels, but contain reduced levels of cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1). Additionally, the majority of Cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. In contrast, PHA-induced G2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active Cdk1. Failure of ISF-treated cells to dephosphorylate Cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of Cdc25. These studies suggest that the CdtB protein alone is capable of inducing G2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of HeLa cells. Our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB (ISF) and possibly for other Cdt family members as well. Thus, Cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with Cdt-producing organisms.
TI  - Comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - Saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (SAM), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated bone and on various mammalian cell populations. In this study, the relative ability of the SAM from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha has been investigated. The bacteria investigated were Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia and Campylobacter rectus. Human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the SAM, or of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each SAM. All SAMs demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - Mono-Mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. Activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. However, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each SAM when compared on a concentration basis (w/v). The most active SAM was from A. actinomycetemcomitans with those from E. corrodens and P. gingivalis being slightly less active. The least active cytokine-stimulating SAMs were from C. rectus and Pr. intermedia. One major difference between the SAMs and E. coli LPS was the inability of the former to stimulate HGFs to release IL-1 beta or TNF alpha although they could stimulate PBMCs to release these cytokines. This may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.
