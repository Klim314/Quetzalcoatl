TI  == isolation and characterization of a novel adenosine deaminase inhibitor, iada-7,  from bacillus sp. j-89.
AB  == adenosine deaminase (ada), an enzyme involved in purine metabolism, catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of adenosine into inosine and free ammonia. ada regulation has been targeted as a potential therapeutic agent for viral infections and lymphoproliferative disorders. in this study, we isolated a novel ada inhibitor from a culture of bacillus sp. j-89, and evaluated its anti-proliferative activity on human cancer cell lines. the ada inhibitor was deduced as a 2-n-methyl-2,4-diazacycloheptanone by analyses of uv, ir, ei-mass, (1)h-nmr, (13)c-(1)h nmr, and (13)c-nmr spectroscopy, and was designated iada-7. iada-7 was shown to inhibit purified mammalian and actinomyces ada. iada-7 also inhibited the proliferation of both jurkat t cells (ic(50) = 15 microg/ml) and j 82 (human  transitional-cell carcinoma, bladder) cells (ic(50) = 25 microg/ml). in jurkat t  cells, apoptosis with 15 microg/ml iada-7 for 24 and 48 hours was 9 and 13%, respectively. these results suggest that iada-7 can inhibit ada activity in multiple species and that it may represent a good candidate as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent due to its demonstrated anti-proliferative activity on cancer cells.

TI  == diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil.
AB  == biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (hdm). we characterized biosurfactant producing microbial populations from a long beach soil, california (usa) and a hong kong soil (china), contaminated with diesel oil. a total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. the highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of l1, l2 and l3 isolates from a long beach soil (41.4mn m(-1)). isolate l1 (acinetobacter  junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5 mn m(-1)). the emulsifying capacity evaluated by the e24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate l5 (74%). no substantial emulsification was achieved with the  cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. based on surface tension and the e24 index results, isolates f1, f2, f3, f4, l1, l2, l3 and l4 were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing as bacillus cereus, bacillus sphaericus, b. fusiformis, acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, pseudomonas sp. and b. pumilus, respectively. cluster analyses of 16s rrna gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. five isolates (isolates f1, f2, f3, f4 and l4) belong to the firmicutes order, two isolates (l1 and l3) belong to the proteobacteria order and one isolate (l2) is an actinomyces sp. simpson's index (1 - d) and the shannon-weaver index (h) revealed more diversity of hdm in the hong kong soil, while evenness (e) and the equitability (j) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  == characterization and molecular cloning of a novel enzyme, inorganic polyphosphate/atp-glucomannokinase, of arthrobacter sp. strain km.
AB  == a bacterium exhibiting activities of several inorganic polyphosphate [poly(p)]- and atp-dependent kinases, including glucokinase, nad kinase, mannokinase, and fructokinase, was isolated, determined to belong to the genus arthrobacter, and designated arthrobacter sp. strain km. among the kinases, a novel enzyme responsible for the poly(p)- and atp-dependent mannokinase activities was purified 2,200-fold to homogeneity from a cell extract of the bacterium. the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 30 kda. this enzyme phosphorylated glucose and mannose with a high affinity for glucose, utilizing poly(p) as well as atp, and was designated poly(p)/atp-glucomannokinase. the k(m) values of the enzyme for glucose, mannose, atp, and hexametaphosphate were determined to be 0.50, 15, 0.20, and 0.02 mm, respectively. the catalytic sites for poly(p)-dependent phosphorylation and atp-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme were found to be shared, and the poly(p)-utilizing mechanism of the enzyme was shown to be nonprocessive. the gene encoding the poly(p)/atp-glucomannokinase was cloned from arthrobacter sp. strain km, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. this gene contained an open reading frame consisting of 804 bp coding for a putative polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 29,480 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of the polypeptide exhibited homology to the amino acid sequences of the poly(p)/atp-glucokinase of mycobacterium tuberculosis h37rv (level of homology, 45%), atp-dependent glucokinases of corynebacterium glutamicum (45%), renibacterium salmoninarum (45%), and bacillus subtilis (35%),  and proteins of bacteria belonging to the order actinomyces whose functions are not known. alignment of these homologous proteins revealed seven conserved regions. the mannose and poly(p) binding sites of poly(p)/atp-glucomannokinase are discussed.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

TI  == beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms in apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis.
AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == purification and characterization of three thermostable endochitinases of a noble bacillus strain, mh-1, isolated from chitin-containing compost.
AB  == a thermophilic and actinic bacterium strain, mh-1, which produced three different endochitinases in its culture fluid was isolated from chitin-containing compost.  the microorganism did not grow in any of the usual media for actinomyces but only in colloidal chitin supplemented with yeast extract and (2, 6-o-dimethyl)-beta-cyclodextrin. compost extract enhanced its growth. in spite of the formation of branched mycelia, other properties of the strain, such as the formation of endospores, the presence of meso-diaminopimelic acid in the cell wall, the percent g+c of dna (55%), and the partial 16s ribosomal dna sequence, indicated that strain mh-1 should belong to the genus bacillus. three isoforms of endochitinase (l, m, and s) were purified to homogeneity and characterized from bacillus sp. strain mh-1. they had different molecular masses (71, 62, and 53 kda), pis (5.3, 4.8, and 4.7), and n-terminal amino acid sequences. chitinases l, m, and s showed relatively high temperature optima (75, 65, and 75 degreesc) and  stabilities and showed ph optima in an acidic range (ph 6.5, 5.5, and 5.5, respectively). when reacted with acetylchitohexaose [(glcnac)6], chitinases l and s produced (glcnac)2 at the highest rate while chitinase m produced (glcnac)3 at  the highest rate. none of the three chitinases hydrolyzed (glcnac)2. chitinase l  produced (glcnac)2 and (glcnac)3 in most abundance from 66 and 11% partially acetylated chitosan. the p-nitrophenol (pnp)-releasing activity of chitinase l was highest toward pnp-(glcnac)2, and those of chitinases m and s were highest toward pnp-(glcnac)3. all three enzymes were inert to pnp-glcnac. agcl, hgcl2, and (glcnac)2 inhibited the activities of all three enzymes, while mncl2 and cacl2 slightly activated all of the enzymes.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii.
AB  == an antibiotic produced by the scab disease-suppressive streptomyces diastatochromogenes strain ponssii has been isolated and partially characterized. the antibiotic is produced throughout culture growth, with maximum amounts accumulating in the broth when the culture is in the early stationary phase of growth. the activity declines within about 30 h after the culture enters stationary phase. purification techniques included chromatography on amberlite xad-2, deae sephadex and sp sephadex in addition to c18 hplc with an average yield of 75%. this antibiotic only inhibits pathogenic strains of s. scabies that cause scab disease on potato and other tuberous vegetables and does not affect s. griseus, s. venezuelae, actinomyces bovis, nocardia asteroides, clostridium perfringens, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, serratia marcescens and escherichia coli. the antibiotic has a molecular weight of 500 or less, and is stable for weeks at acidic ph but is very labile at alkaline ph conditions.

TI  == [main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern cameroon].
AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.

TI  == isolation and amino acid sequence of a glutamic acid specific endopeptidase from  bacillus licheniformis.
AB  == an endopeptidase cleaving specifically at the carboxyl side of acidic amino acid  residues, preferentially at glutamic acid, has been isolated from a commercial extract obtained by fermentation with bacillus licheniformis. using ion-exchange  chromatography and affinity chromatography on bacitracin-sepharose, it was possible, from 100 ml commercial extract, to isolate 100 mg homogeneous enzyme in a yield of 50%. it is the first description of a large-scale isolation of a glu/asp-specific enzyme. the preparation was essentially free of contaminating activities. the isolated enzyme consists of one peptide chain of 222 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular mass of 23,589 da. the determined amino acid sequence shows similarity to the glu/asp-specific enzymes previously isolated from staphylococcus aureus v8, actinomyces sp. and streptomyces thermovulgaris. the substrate preference of the enzyme has been investigated. although non-specific cleavages were observed after prolonged hydrolysis at high  enzyme concentrations the enzyme appears to be essentially specific for glu-xaa and asp-xaa, with strong preference for the former. the isolated enzyme exhibits  a bell-shaped ph/activity profile with an optimum at ph 7.5-8.0. the activity is  adversely affected by high ionic strength and beneficially affected by the inclusion of calcium ions in the assay medium. the enzyme is completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate, suggesting that it is a serine endopeptidase. it is partially inhibited by edta.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == evaluation of a scheme for predicting the gram-staining reaction of organisms causing bovine mastitis.
AB  == the accuracy of a scheme for predicting the gram-staining reaction of organisms causing bovine mastitis in cows with systemic signs of disease (anorexia) was evaluated over 1 year. criteria for making the predictions included: season of year, stage of lactation, appearance of milk, detection and duration of teat injuries, and milk odor. it was possible to determine the cause by microbiologic  culture of specimens from 136 of the 147 cows of the study. of 78 infections caused by gram-negative (mostly coliform) organisms, 62 (79%) were predicted accurately to be caused by gram-negative organisms. of 57 infections caused by gram-positive organisms, 45 (79%) were predicted correctly to be caused by gram-positive organisms. correctly predicted as gram-positive organisms causing infection were: actinomyces pyogenes in 20 of 21 (95%) cows; staphylococcus sp in 14 of 22 (64%) cows; streptococcus sp in 10 of 13 (77%) cows and bacillus sp in 1 cow. overall accuracy, in those instances when bacteria were isolated (136 cows), was 78%.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.

TI  == [effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  == bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains,  the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, streptococcus sanguis, s. saprophyticus, s. faecalis, escherichia coli, micrococcus flavus, actinomyces viscosus, veillonella sp., enterobacter liquefaciens, yersinia enterocolitica. lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. proteus vulgaris, y. enterocolitica and chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. the yeasts endomyces lactis, saccharomyces cerevisiae, rhodotorula mucilaginosa and cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. the kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did  not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
