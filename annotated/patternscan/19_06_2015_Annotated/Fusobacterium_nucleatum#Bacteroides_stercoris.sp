TI  == review of the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic pathogens.
AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == in vitro activity of gemifloxacin (sb 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  == gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) cfu/spot. comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (du-6859a), penicillin g, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. the mic(50) and mic(90) (mics at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for  clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for fusobacterium varium  (13), 0.5 and 1; for fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for prevotella melaninogenica (11),  1 and 1. gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than  trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were  equivalent against clostridia and p. asaccharolytica. gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (du 6859a) against peptostreptococci, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria.  sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of bacteroides and other genera of gram-negative anaerobic rods.
AB  == a numerical taxonomy was performed on 157 cultures (141 different strains) of species of bacteroides, polyphyromonas, prevotella [not prevotella (labroue, 1976)] and fusobacterium. isolates were each tested for 111 phenotypic characters which included possession of constitutive enzymes, fermentation of specific carbohydrates, gas chromatographic analysis of metabolic end-products and of cellular carboxylic acid composition. computation of similarity coefficients was  followed by a single-linkage cluster analysis. at the 94% similarity level, the following groupings at genus level were apparent: (1) bacteroides ureolyticus; (2) fusobacterium mortiferum, f. necrogenes, f. necrophorum, f. nucleatum and f.  varium; (3) b. caccae, b. distasonis, b. eggerthii, b. fragilis, b. merdae, b. ovatus, b stercoris, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformus and b. vulgatus; (4) b. splanchnicus; (5) porphyromonas asaccharolytica; (6) b. bivius (prevotella bivia); (7) b. disiens (p. disiens); (8) b. intermedius (p. intermedia);and (9) b. melaninogenicus (p. melaninogenica). single isolates of b. ruminicola (p. ruminicola), b. denticola (p. denticola) and b. capillosus did not cluster with other strains.
