TI  - Isolation and identification of microbes associated with mobile phones in Dammam  in eastern Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine microbial contamination of mobile phones in the city of Dammam, in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia, and identify the most important microbial species associated with these phones in order to take the necessary remedial measures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis of a total of 202 samples was done to identify fungal and pathogenic bacteria isolates. Sterile swabs were firmly passed on the handset, the buttons and the screens of mobile phones, then inoculated into media of bacteria and fungi. Frequency distribution of isolates were calculated. RESULTS: There were 737 isolated of the following bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria sicca, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterobacter aerogenes at the rate of 56.58, 13.57, 8.01, 7.73, 6.51, 3.66, 2.85 and 1.09% respectively. There were fungal isolates as follows: Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium sp., Penicillium spp., Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus ochraceus at the rate of 29.07, 26.74, 20.93, 10.47, 6.98, 2.33, 2.33, 1.16%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that all mobile phones under consideration were infected by several microbes, most of which belonged to the natural flora of the human body as well as airborne fungi and soil. This means that it is necessary to sterilize hands after contact with a phone since it is a source of disease transmission.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin versus cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared the use and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to cefuroxime axetil for adult patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. METHOD: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) versus cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily) for 2 to 3 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial maxillary sinus infections or acute exacerbation of chronic bacterial sinusitis. Patients with microbiologically and radiologically confirmed sinusitis infection composed the efficacy population. RESULTS: Of the 83 patients enrolled, 13 of 42 (31%) ciprofloxacin- and 19 of 41 (46%) cefuroxime axetil-treated patients had a respiratory pathogen isolated from a sinus aspiration. The most frequent pretherapy isolated included Haemophilus influenzae (11), streptococcus species (20), staphylococcus species (7), Proteus mirabilis (3), and Neisseria sicca (3). At the end of therapy, clinical resolution or improvement in efficacy-valid patients was achieved in 12 (100%) ciprofloxacin-treated patients and in 14 (74%) cefuroxime axetil recipients. The five (26%) cefuroxime axetil clinical failures were due to development of superinfection. Bacteriologic eradication occurred in 12 (100%) and 14 (100%) ciprofloxacin and cefuroxime axetil patients, respectively. Similar clinical and bacteriologic response rates were observed at the 2- to 4-week follow-up. Among 83 intent-to-treat patients, 19 (45%) ciprofloxacin and 14 (34%) cefuroxime axetil patients had drug-related adverse events. The most common adverse event in both treatment groups was gastrointestinal. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that ciprofloxacin is efficacious in the management of acute bacterial sinusitis.
