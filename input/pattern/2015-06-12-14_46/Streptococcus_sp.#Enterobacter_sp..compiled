TI  - [Profile and susceptibility to antibiotics in urinary tract infections in children and newborns from 2012 to 2013: Data from 1879 urine cultures].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We present recent data on the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of uropathogenic bacteria isolated in children and newborns in our region over the past 2years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study on the positive urine cultures from pediatric and neonatal populations during 2012-2013. Bacteria were identified using conventional methods. Susceptibility testing was performed and interpreted as recommended by the committee of the susceptibility of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM). RESULTS: We collected 1879 non-redundant bacteria with more than 73% Escherichia coli. Children and infants (mean age, 32months [range, 1month to 14years]) accounted for 84% of the bacteria collected and newborns (mean age, 12days [range, 1day to 1month]) 16%. A female predominance was observed in the pediatric population (M:F sex ratio, 3.2), whereas for the neonatal population, the proportions were almost identical in both sexes (M:F sex ratio, 1.1). Most of the positive urine cultures (n=1234) were from the community. Hospitalized patients (n=636) were divided into pediatric (60%) and neonatal units (40%). Five bacterial genera dominated the bacteriological profile: E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., and Enterococcus. The susceptibility of the main BUP antibiotics used for treatment of frequent UTI showed the effectiveness of furadoine, imipenem, fosfomycin, and colistin. Amoxicillin kept constant activity against Enterococcus and Streptococcus agalactiae. The rates of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to beta-lactam antibiotics were high, especially in the neonatal population. The production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) was noted in 12.8% of pediatric Enterobacteria vs. 22.6% of the neonatal strains. For community Enterobacteriaceae, the activity of beta-lactam antibiotics was limited with 11.2% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (C3G), including 8.6% ESBL production. CONCLUSION: The impact of widespread use of beta-lactam antibiotics in neonatal and pediatric environments is felt. Colistin, imipenem, and fosfomycin are the most frequently used antibiotics active against bacteria responsible for neonatal and pediatric UTI; however, they cannot be used as probabilistic treatment. Nitrofurans seem to be active antibiotics on UTI, but they present limits in their use in neonatal and pediatric populations. Their indication in case of pyelonephritis should be discussed.
TI  - Bacterial community structure associated with elective cesarean section versus vaginal delivery in Chinese newborns.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Increasing attention is being paid to the potential for cesarean birth to influence the taxa of the bacteria that compose the infant intestinal microbiota. The present study characterized the diversity of the intestinal microbiota in newborn infants delivered vaginally (VD) or by cesarean section (CD). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed using fecal specimens collected on days 2 and 4 of postnatal life from 25 VD infants and 16 CD infants. Profiles of the fecal microbiota were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in combination with 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing of the clones corresponding to the degenerating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands. RESULTS: On days 2 and 4 of postnatal life, VD and CD infants did not differ in the richness and evenness of the fecal bacterial community; however, the taxa of the fecal microbiota were significantly different between the 2 groups. In VD infants, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides sp, and Bifidobacterium longum were the dominant microbes. In CD infants, Staphylococcus sp, Clostridium sp, Enterobacter sp, and Streptococcus sp were more common. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that delivery method has a profound influence on the structure of the intestinal microbiota in Chinese newborn infants. This is in accordance with data reported in other regions.
TI  - Chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  - The essential oil (EO) composition of ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi was analyzed by GC-MS. The oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). Seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). The major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). Trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. The antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Corynebacterium sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Bacillus sp., Nocardia sp. and Streptococcus group D). The essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius Raddi has shown to be active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/mL to 56.86 mug/mL. However, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, Gram-positive species showed greater sensitivity to the action of EO, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.
TI  - Causes, diagnosis and therapy of common diseases in neonatal puppies in the first days of life: cornerstones of practical approach.
AB  - Neonatal diseases and losses are a common and often unavoidable problem within breeding kennels. Altogether, morbidity and mortality ranges, according to the literature, from 5 to 35%. Among non-infectious causes besides hypoxia during birth, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia and dehydration are mostly responsible for puppy diseases and losses. Approximately 90% of all deaths in hypoxaemic pups occur during the first 2 days. Of 183 pups with hypoxia, 63 died, 92.7% of them within 48 h after birth. Among infectious causes, bacterial infection is the most common cause of neonatal mortality. Escherichia coli, streptococci, staphylococci, Pseudomonas sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and some other micro-organisms are regularly involved in neonatal infections. Post-mortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp. as responsible bacteria. The dam and the environment are suspected as sources of neonatal infections as it was shown by genetic relatedness of responsible bacterial strains isolated in both puppies and their dams. From a total of 517 puppies with bacterial infections, the treatment results documented that parenteral administration of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in 308 neonates showed the best result. Diagnosis of diseases is often made difficult by the absence of variability in clinical signs contrary to adult dogs. Findings during a physical examination in pups differ from those in adults. Furthermore, treatment recommendations have to meet the special conditions in neonates concerning drug metabolism and excretion.
TI  - Identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16S rRNA gene libraries.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [POE]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [PTE]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [EE]). Several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. However, until now, the polybacterial communities of POE, PTE, and EE have not been precisely studied. Hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16S rRNA gene libraries. Of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-PCR-positive samples. The obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA) to identify unique clones. The multiple types of ARDRA patterns (P=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (P=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in POE, PTE, and EE. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in EE. Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus spp. (n=19), Streptococcus spp. (n=18), Staphylococcus spp. (n=6), Exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), Gemella spp. (n=2), Enterococcus spp. (n=2), a Lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a Clostridium sp. (n=1), and a Nocardia sp. (n=1), and Gram-negative bacteria, including Serratia spp. (n=18), Pseudomonas spp. (n=10), Enterobacter spp. (n=8), Acinetobacter spp. (n=3), Pantoea spp. (n=3), a Haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a Massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. Interestingly, among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. Besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. Therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of POE, PTE, and EE infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - [Diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (BF) on the surface of the implanted material. The majority of natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. However, there always only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. The aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of BF on endotracheal tube (ETT), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. METHOD: Thirty-five ETTs were obtained from 26 neonates on mechanical ventilator (from October 2012 to March 2013) in Department of Neonatology of Children's Hospital. Among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. DGGE profiling of 16S rDNA gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. TA Cloning Kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF. RESULT: The mean bands of 35 ETTs cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE, and the mean Shanon-Wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. The 16 ETTs were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. The indwelling days of 6/7 patients' ETTs increased, the Shanon-siener indexes were decreased. Among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different Shanon-siener indexes. The result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained Klebsiella SP., 28 cases (80%) had Pseudomonas SP., 27 cases (77%) had Streptococcus SP., and 32 cases (91%) had Uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) Klebsiella SP. and 22/27(82%) Streptococcus SP. were accompanied by Pseudomonas SP.. There were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. Eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the ETTs on which Klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. CONCLUSION: The diversity of microbiota in BF on ETT was confirmed. 16S rDNA PCR-DGGE could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ETT-BF, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of BF.
TI  - Bacterial superinfection in zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL) is a polymorphic disease. It is generally accepted that bacterial superinfection may play a role in the clinical appearance of the lesions and may delay or prevent the healing process. However, the pattern of bacterial pathogens involved has rarely been investigated. MATERIAL/METHODS: The aim of this study was to identify the bacterial species contaminating the suspected ZCL and their susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics. Microscopic examination of stained smears and cultures were used to differentiate ZCL from non-ZCL lesions in a rural area north of Isfahan, Iran from July to December 2009. Bacteria were isolated from the lesions and identified and antibiotic susceptibility was determined by standard microbiological techniques. RESULTS: The results show that 602 (68%) of 855 patients were positive for ZCL, of which 83.4% with volcano-shape, 8.8% psoriasiform, 6.6% popular form and 1.2% with other atypical forms of ZCL. The bacteria were isolated from 66.8% of ZCL (70% of volcano-shape, 60% of psoriasiform and 25% of popular form) and 64.7% of non-ZCL lesions. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (41.7%) and S. epidermidis (28%) followed by Bacillus sp. Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Ciprofloxacin, Erythromycin, Cefazolin and Clindamycin were the most effective antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial superinfection appears to be very common in ZCL, but its prevalence is not different from that of non-ZCL lesions and it has little effect on the clinical appearance of anthroponotic cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL). Local lesion care and management of bacterial superinfection must be considered in the treatment of ZCL.
TI  - Antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiont marine Enterobacter sp at Kavaratti Island, Lakshadweep archipelago.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To isolate antibacterial potential of sponge endosymbiotic bacteria from marine sponges at Lakshadweep archipelago. Also to identify the potent bacteria by 16s rDNA sequencing and determine the antibacterial activity against clinical pathogens by MIC. METHODS: Sponge samples was collected from sub-tidal habitats at Kavaratti Island and identified. The endosymbiotic bacteria were isolated and selected potential bacteria which show antibacterial activity in preliminary screening against clinical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella typhi (S. typhi), Klebsiella pneumoniea (K. pneumoniea) and Streptococcus sp. by disc diffusion assay. The crude extracts of potential bacteria LB3 was tested against clinical pathogens by MIC. The LB3 strain was identified by 16s rDNA sequencing, 1 111 bp was submitted in NCBI (HQ589912) and constructed phylogenetic tree. RESULTS: Sponge sample was identified as Dysidea granulosa (D. granulosa) and potential bacteria LB3 identified as Enterobacter sp TTAG. Preliminary screening of sponge isolates against clinical pathogens, LB3 strain was selected as potential producer of secondary metabolites and crude extract was implies on MIC of LB3 have confirmed with lowest concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in broth medium influence of crude extract on growth inhibitory activity after 5 h of incubation period and completed the inhibitory activity at 15 h. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concluded that phylogenetic analysis of endosymbiotic bacteria Enterobacter sp from sponge D. granulosa of Lakshadweep islands showed significant antibacterial activity against clinical bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Potential application of extracts from Indian almond (Terminalia catappa Linn.) leaves in Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens Regan) culture.
AB  - Indian almond (Terminalia catappa Linn.) leaves with green and red coloration were tested for bactericidal activity with pathogenic bacteria and their acute toxicity to Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens Regan). Powder of Indian almond leaves was extracted with water at the ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and then freeze-dried to a dry powder. Bactericidal efficacy was tested against 28 isolates of pathogenic bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter spp., Plesiomonas shigelloides, Pseudomonas spp., Shewanella putrefaciens, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp.) isolated from Siamese fighting fish. A paper disc diffusion method was tested on Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) by inoculating 1 x 106 CFU/mL of each bacterial suspension. Paper disks (5 mm) were impregnated with either 10 microl of green or red Indian almond leaf extract at a concentration of 12,000 ppm, then laid on the surface of the MHA. The results revealed that aqueous extract of red Indian almond leaves could inhibit the growth of tested bacteria better than the green extract. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined. Extracts of green and red leaves were diluted in Mueller Hinton Broth (MHB) to obtain a starting extract concentration of 6,000 ppm then twofold serially diluted in a 96-well microtitre plate. The pathogenic bacteria were inoculated into each well at a density of 1 x 105 CFU/mL and incubated at 35 degrees C for 24 h. The growth of bacteria was detected by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliium bromide. The MIC of the red leaf extract ranged from 187.5 to 375 ppm which was lower than for green leaf extract (375-750 ppm). The MBC range of the red leaf extract was 375-750 ppm which was lower than for the green leaf extract (750-1,500 ppm). Acute toxicity tests (96-h LC50) of Indian almond green and red leaf water extracts in Siamese fighting fish were conducted. A logarithmic-spaced series of Indian almond leaf extract concentrations (6 concentrations) between the highest concentration that did not kill fish and the lowest concentration that killed all fish were used. Each concentration had three replicates (20 fish/replication). Mortality was observed after 96 hours. The LC50 value was calculated using probit analysis. The 96-h LC50 value for green and red leaf extracts was 1,765.69 and 1,651.21 ppm, respectively. When Siamese fighting fish were cultured in water added with Indian almond water extract at 5 concentrations for 5 days and then challenged with Aeromonas hydrophila at a concentration of 1 x 106 CFU/mL, the survival rate of the Siamese fighting fish infected by A. hydrophila could be decreased by bathing with Indian almond red leaf extract at 750 ppm while green leaf Indian almond extract was effective for Aeromonad septicemia therapy in Siamese fighting fish when used at a concentration of 1,000 ppm. In conclusion, red leaf Indian almond aqueous extract had high potential for the control of pathogenic bacteria at a concentration of 750 ppm which should be safe for Siamese fighting fish taking into consideration the toxic level of the extract.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  - Resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. Therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. Tigecycline (Tygacil, Wyeth) is a relatively new FDA and EMEA approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. In this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. In overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/L, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean MIC values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/L, respectively). MIC50 and MIC90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/L for E. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/L for Klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/L for various Enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/L for Pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/L for Acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L for Serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/L for Streptococcus sp. The MIC values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for Acinetobacter sp. (included A. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.
TI  - Effect of neem extract against the bacteria isolated from marine fish.
AB  - Marine ornamental fishes are exceedingly valuable due to their high demand in domestic and international markets. There is a growing global interest to rear the fishes in captivity. But problem due to bacteria and fungi are the major hitch in captive condition. Since, the use of antibiotics is banned, an attempt was made to ascertain in vitro assay of the neem leaves extract against the bacterial pathogens isolated from infected fishes. Bacterial strains isolated from infected regions of the clown fishes Amphiprion sebae and A. ocellaris were identified as Aeromonas hydrophila, Enterobacter sp., E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp., Streptococcus sp., Vibrio cholerae, V. alginolyticus, V. parahaemolyticus and Yersinia enterocolitica. Ethanol and methanol extracts were highly inhibitory to the bacterial isolates when compared to other solvents. Ethanol extracts exhibited low minimum inhibitory concentration (75-250 microg ml(-1)) as compared to other extracts. The present finding revealed that the neem leaf extract significantly reduces the bacterial pathogens and their infection in marine ornamental fishes.
TI  - The use of culture-independent tools to characterize bacteria in endo-tracheal aspirates from pre-term infants at risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  - Although premature infants are increasingly surviving the neonatal period, up to  one-third develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Despite evidence that bacterial colonization of the neonatal respiratory tract by certain bacteria may be a risk factor in BPD development, little is known about the role these bacteria play. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of culture-independent molecular profiling methodologies to identify potential etiological agents in neonatal airway secretions. This study used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and clone sequence analyses to characterize bacterial species in endo-tracheal (ET) aspirates from eight intubated pre-term infants. A wide range of different bacteria was identified in the samples. Forty-seven T-RF band lengths were resolved in the sample set, with a range of 0-15 separate species in each patient. Clone sequence analyses confirmed the identity of individual species detected by T-RFLP. We speculate that the identification of known opportunistic pathogens including S. aureus, Enterobacter sp., Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus sp., within the airways of pre-term infants, might be causally related to the subsequent development of BPD. Further, we suggest that culture-independent techniques, such as T-RFLP, hold important potential for the characterization of neonatal conditions, such as BPD.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - [Activity of tigecycline against pathogen bacteria isolated in respiratory infectious disease in Europe. TEST study 2004-2007].
AB  - Tigecycline (TGC), a semisynthetic glycylcycline, has a documented activity on Gram+ and Gram- pathogens including oxacillin-resistant (MRSA) and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is an international surveillance study designed to assess the in vitro activity of TGC and 11 comparators against a range of important clinical pathogens from both the community and the hospital. The aim of this study was to assess efficacy of TGC, using this database, against pathogens implicated in community or hospital pneumonia and sinusitis. A total of 4163 isolates were consecutively collected in 21 European countries during three years (2004-2007). In all center, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) were determinated with the same Microscan panel (Dade-Behring). Tigecycline exhibited a good activity against respiratory pathogens, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Hundred percent of cocci Gram+ (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus sp.) and 100% of Haemophilus sp. are inhibited with 0.5 mg/L, without effect of an associated beta-lactam resistance mechanism. TGC is active in vitro on 89% of Enterobacteriaceae, with MIC 90 less or equal to 2mg/L. Eighty-nine percent of Enterobacter sp. and 77% of Serratia sp. are susceptible with range of MIC 90 from 2 to 4 mg/L. These interesting results obtained in vitro are to be strengthened by clinical studies.
TI  - The pathological newborn in small animals: the neonate is not a small adult.
AB  - The rate of perinatal death is variable but highest during parturition, immediately after birth and in the first days of life. Infectious diseases, above all bacterial, are the second most important cause of mortality after losses during parturition. A lot of factors are involved predisposing puppies and kittens to bacterial infections: respiratory distress, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, dehydration, congenital abnormalities. E. coli, streptococci and staphylococci, Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp. and anaerobes are regularly involved in bacterial infections in neonates. Postmortem findings especially document E. coli, Staphylococcus or Streptococcus species as causes of disease and death shortly after birth. The environment and mothers are suspected as sources of infection (vaginal discharge, milk, faeces, oropharynx, skin) for puppies and kittens. Genetic relatedness of bacterial strains in puppies and their mothers was found in staphylococci and E.coli. These results indicate that for repeated cases of bacterial infections in neonates diagnostic procedures of milk, vaginal and faecal swabs from bitches result in isolation of the responsible bacteria with a high probability and suggest that preterm treatment could help to control bacterial diseases and losses in pups.
TI  - Bacteria fauna from the house fly, Musca domestica (L.).
AB  - The house fly, Musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. The general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. The habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. Fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in Peninsular Malaysia. The flies were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. All materials used for collection of samples were sterile. Bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. Bacillus sp., Coccobacillus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Microccus sp., Streptococcus sp., Acinetobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus sp., Escherichia sp., Klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. Newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - The influence of endoscopic procedures upon the contamination of Helicobacter pylori cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the various diagnostic methods for the detection of Helicobacter pylori infection, histological examination and microbiological processing of gastric biopsy samples are assumed to be the gold standard techniques. AIMS: Since H. pylori culture can be affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria, we evaluated the efficacy of endoscope disinfection and the influence of endoscopic procedures on culture contamination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The procedures used during the first two routine endoscopies were evaluated during 28 consecutive days. Endoscopy room, forceps and endoscopic channel were analyzed before and after the beginning of normal procedures. After disinfection, a biopsy simulation was performed to verify the gastric bacteria. RESULTS: Endoscope disinfection removed all organisms from forceps and endoscopic channel with 100% efficacy. The most frequent non-H. pylori bacteria detected were Streptococcus bovis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensibility of the H. pylori culture was affected by the presence of non-H. pylori bacteria. CONCLUSION: The risk of transmission of microorganisms was not detectable when sterilized biopsy forceps and stringent disinfection standards were employed. Whilst S. bovis and E. hormaechei may be common in gastric microbial flora, the presence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus indicated that the manipulation of biopsies could be responsible for culture contamination with these bacteria.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  - AIM: The present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. METHODS: We identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). RESULTS: Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. A single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). Patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per mL of bile (> 105 cfu/mL). The predominant Gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were Escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), Enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), Pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). The predominant Gram-positive bacteria were Enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and Streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). Bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. All Gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all Gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (CIM90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/mL. Gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. Although all five isolates of E. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) E. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. CONCLUSION: E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. faecalis and Streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
TI  - Changing pattern of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  - Adequate infection prophylaxis and empirical antibiotic therapy are of critical importance after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We examined the evolution of bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics in 492 patients (198 allografts and 294 autografts) transplanted between 1982 and 1999 and evaluated whether ciprofloxacin prophylaxis and an empirical antibiotic regimen (glycopeptide + third-generation cephalosporin) were still valid. We collected all susceptibility tests performed during the initial hospitalization on blood cultures as well as routine surveillance cultures and analyzed susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and to major antibiotics used in our unit. Gram-positive cocci rapidly became resistant to ciprofloxacin (susceptibility around 70% in 1990 to less than 20% in 1998) but sensitivity to glycopeptides remained unaltered. There was a rapid decline in the number of patients colonized with Gram-negative bacilli in the early years of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. However, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin fell sharply from around 90% in 1990 to around 30% in 1999. In parallel, susceptibility to ceftazidime also decreased to less than 80% in recent years. Piperacillin (+/- tazobactam) did not show any variation over time and its efficacy remained too low (about 60%). Imipenem as well as recently introduced cefepim and meropenem showed stable and excellent profiles (>90% susceptibility). IN CONCLUSION: (1) quinolone prophylaxis has now lost most of its value; (2) the choice of a third-generation cephalosporin for empirical antibiotic therapy may no longer be the best because of the emergence of Gram-negative strains resistant to beta-lactamases, such as Enterobacter sp. More appropriate regimens of empirical antibiotic therapy in HSCT recipients may be based on the use of a carbapenem or fourth-generation cephalosporin.
TI  - [Correlation of 55 samples of contact lens fluid and direct swabbings of the eye  surface of symptomatic wearers of contact lenses].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiological examination of contact lens storage solutions may reveal the etiological organisms responsible for keratitis and additionally harbour environmental contaminants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1998, conjunctival and corneal smears and scrapes, as well as the storage solutions of 55 soft contact lens wearers were examined microbiologically in a prospective non-randomised cohort study involving 53x unilateral and 2x bilateral cases of keraitis. RESULTS: In 42 of the in-use contact lens storage solutions, the following organisms were found: 8x Bacillus sp., 7x P. aeruginosa and 8x other pseudomonads, 6x Alcaligenes xylosans, 4x Serratia liquefaciens, 4x Enterobacter sp., 4x coagulase negative staphylococci, 3x Serratia marcescens, 3x S. aureus, 2x Streptococcus faecalis, 1x Klebsiella oxytoca and 5x Acanthameba. A significant correlation of ocular cultures was found for Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Serratia, S. aureus, S. faecalis and Acanthameba, but not for Bacillus, Alcaligenes, and coagulase negative staphylococci. Fungi were not found. The more pronounced the clinical picture, the more Gram-negative bacteria were isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological examination of soft contact lens storage solutions of 55 keratitis patients confirmed that the microbes responsible were to be found in the fluid, in addition to environmental contaminants.
TI  - [Hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in Polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. This study describes the incidence of HAP in Poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in Polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and use of mechanical ventilation. The epidemiology of HAP as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. Data for this study was acquired from the Registry of Hospital-acquired Infectious Diseases for the year 1998. Out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be HAP. This study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed HAP (0.3%). Death occurred in 260 of 920 HAP cases or 30%; and HAP found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). The greatest incidence of HAP was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. The most frequently isolated causal agents were the Gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp.), and Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of HAP in this population. It was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. The isolated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). In the Enterobacteriaceae family, Klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and Enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.
TI  - 16S rDNA-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by PCR and DGGE fingerprinting.
AB  - PURPOSE: Establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. METHODS: From 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and DNA was extracted. Fragments of 200 bp, spanning the V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rDNA, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). For phylogenetic identification, DGGE bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16S rDNA clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened by DGGE. Sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the EMBL database. Furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from conventional cultivation. RESULTS: 16S rDNA could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. Sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. The following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: Staphylococcus (n = 8), Corynebacterium (n = 7), Propionibacterium (n = 7), Streptococcus (n = 6), Bacillus (n = 2), Acinetobacter (n = 3), Pseudomonas (n = 3), Proteus (n = 1), and Brevundimonas (n = 1). Four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. They had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of Pantoea and Enterobacter (n = 1), Kingella and Neisseria (n = 1), Serratia and Aranicola (n = 1), and Leuconostoc and Weissella (n = 2), respectively. Culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), Corynebacteria (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Streptococcus sp. (n = 1), Proteus sp. (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). In total, 45% of the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were PCR positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. No sample positive by culture gave negative results by PCR. CONCLUSIONS: 16S rDNA sequence analyses and DGGE fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.
TI  - Significance of fever in Jamaican patients with homozygous sickle cell disease.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and outcome of high fever in Jamaican children with homozygous sickle cell disease. DESIGN: Retrospective review of febrile episodes in a three year period (1 September 1993 to 31 August 1996). SETTING: Sickle cell clinic, an outpatient clinic in Kingston run by the Medical Research Council Laboratories (Jamaica). PATIENTS: Patients with homozygous sickle cell disease under 17 years of age presenting with an axillary temperature >/= 39.0 degrees C (102.4 degrees F). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnosis, death. RESULTS: There were 165 events in 144 patients (66 (45.8%) boys) with a median age of 6.1 years. Bacteraemia was found in 10 (6.1%) events (three Streptococcus pneumoniae, two Haemophilus influenzae type b, two Salmonella sp, one Escherichia coli, one Enterobacter sp, and one Acinetobacter sp), and urinary tract infections in four (2.4%). All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. Acute chest syndrome occurred in 36 (21.8%) events. A painful crisis was associated with 45 (27.3%) events and was the only pathology identified in 20 events (12.1%). Hospital admission was necessary in 66 cases including all those with bacteraemia and 31 with acute chest syndrome. There were two deaths: a 5 year old boy with septic shock associated with H influenzae septicaemia, and a 3 year old boy with the acute chest syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Painful crisis and acute chest syndrome were the most common complications associated with high fever, but other important associated features included bacteraemia and urinary tract infection. Enteric Gram negative organisms accounted for 50% of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of 9 antimicrobials against bacterial strains isolated from patients in intensive care units in brazil: MYSTIC Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - Multi-resistant bacterial strains are increasingly prevalent in hospital environments. Bacterial resistance is an important problem, especially for practitioners in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the selective pressure on the prevalent bacteria in these environments. The MYSTIC (Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection) study has been monitoring the performance of carbapenems and other antibiotics in different hospitals for at least 3 years. The in vitro activities of meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacilin/tazobactam, gentamicin, and tobramycin were compared against 452 recent clinical aerobic isolates. The isolates consisted of 19 species of Gram-negative bacteria (n=290) including K. pneumoniae (n=49), E. coli (n=48), A. baumannii (n=47), Enterobacter spp. (n=41), and P. aeruginosa (n=33) and 9 species of Gram-positive bacteria (n=162) including Staphylococcus aureus (n=63), Enterococcus faecalis (n=22), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22) and coagulase negative Staphylococci (n=21). All isolates were collected from ICU patients. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by Etest methodology, using standardized and controlled procedures. Meropenem and imipenem showed the lowest MIC(90) for all species tested. Gram-negative isolates showed the following overall resistance percentages to the other 7 drugs: tobramycin (43.1%), cefotaxime (38.6%), gentamicin (34.1%), ceftazidime (31.7%), ciprofloxacin (25.5%), piperacillin/tazobactam (26.9%), and cefepime (18.6%). Carbapenems were the most active drugs overall and only P. aeruginosa presented some degree of resistance (18.2%). We also evaluated the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) among all Enterobacteriaceae members (n=176) by Etest/ESBL strip. ESBL production was detected in 51 strains (29.0%). Among them, Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most prevalent at 59.2%, followed by Enterobacter spp. (19.5%) and E. coli (14.6%). The high level of resistance against several antimicrobials and the alarming rate of ESBL production may restrict therapeutic choice to the carbapenems in this selected group of patients.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of G1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  - G1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in Cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. A compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. We tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. The following are MIC50, MIC90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: E. coli 16, 16, 4 32; Klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; Citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; Enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; Coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; Enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; Staphylococcus aureus 8, 16, 4-16; Streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; Streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; Candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; Candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; Candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. MIC values appear lower for Gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. G1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.
TI  - Cocaine and lidocaine with phenylephrine as topical anesthetics: antimicrobial activity against common nasal pathogens.
AB  - Topical anesthetics are commonly used in the evaluation of nasal pathology. The anesthetics routinely used, 4% lidocaine with phenylephrine, or 4% cocaine, have been demonstrated to have varying inhibitory effects on bacterial cultures. The present study examined the antimicrobial activity of these topical anesthetics used in nasal procedures. The pathogens used were Branhamella catarrhalis, Enterobacter sp., Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Organisms were against two-fold serial dilutions of stock preparations of 4% lidocaine with 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.25% phenylephrine, 0.1% methylparaben, 250 mg/ml ampicillin, and 4% cocaine. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration for each of the solutions were obtained. The bacteria studied varied gently in their susceptibility to lidocaine with phenylephrine versus cocaine: Cocaine consistently exhibited greater antimicrobial activity than lidocaine. Phenylephrine and methylparaben showed slight antimicrobial activity. These topical anesthetics have slight bactericidal activity against nasal pathogens, which can sometimes lead to false-negative results. Otolaryngologists should recognize the possible antimicrobial effects of topical anesthetics when culturing specimens. This is especially important when the specimen will be used for guidance of antimicrobial therapy, as in the case of the critically ill patient who requires aspiration for organism-specific therapy. Further studies, specifically in vivo experiments, are needed to determine if use of the drugs produces a significant change in the ability to culture organisms from these sites. This type of study would, however, be difficult to perform, since most patients requiring aspiration are already on high-dose antibiotics that would inhibit the growth of most microorganisms. A modified aspiration technique using a less concentrated topical anesthetic will likely be required to increase the chances of obtaining positive cultures.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens isolated from patients with bloodstream infection: frequencies of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program (United States and Canada, 1997).
AB  - The SENTRY Program was established in January 1997 to measure the predominant pathogens and antimicrobial resistance patterns of nosocomial and community-acquired infections over a broad network of sentinel hospitals in the United States (30 sites), Canada (8 sites), South America (10 sites), and Europe (24 sites). During the first 6-month study period (January to June 1997), a total of 5,058 bloodstream infections (BSI) were reported by North American SENTRY participants (4,119 from the United States and 939 from Canada). In both the United States and Canada, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were the most common BSI isolates, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and beta-hemolytic streptococci were also among the 10 most frequently reported species in both the United States and Canada. Although the rank orders of pathogens in the United States and Canada were similar, distinct differences were noted in the antimicrobial susceptibilities of several pathogens. Overall, U.S. isolates were considerably more resistant than those from Canada. The differences in the proportions of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (26.2 versus 2.7% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), vancomycin-resistant enterococcal isolates (17.7 versus 0% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively), and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter sp. isolates (30.6 versus 6.2% for U.S. and Canadian isolates, respectively) dramatically emphasize the relative lack of specific antimicrobial resistance genes (mecA, vanA, and vanB) in the Canadian microbial population. Among U.S. isolates, resistance to oxacillin among staphylococci, to vancomycin among enterococci, to penicillin among pneumococci, and to ceftazidime among Enterobacter spp. was observed in both nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens, although in almost every instance the proportion of resistant strains was higher among nosocomial isolates. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase, and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens and resistance profiles is essential on national and international scales.
TI  - [Bacteremia after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with and without therapeutic procedure: frequency, associated factors and clinical significance].
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency, associate factors and clinical features of bacteremia in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), with or without therapeutic procedures. METHODS: Prospectively, 42 consecutives patients undergoing 46 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) from August to December 1994 were analyzed. The search for bacteremia was done by drawing 6 blood samples for cultures from peripheral blood. Two blood samples were collected before the ERCP and 4 of them after. The bottles used for cultures were Bactec bottles. The bottles were incubated in the Bactec 9240 system, and eventual bacteria detect were identificated by the manual routine of the laboratory and also with the autoScan/Microscan system. RESULTS: All blood cultures obtained before the ERCPs were negatives. Bacteremia were detected after 7 endoscopic procedures. In two episodes of bacteremia, the microorganism identified (Staphylococcus epidermidis) was considered to be a contaminant. The other 5 episodes of bacteremia were considered true bacteremia (frequency- 10.9%), and the microorganisms identified were: Streptococcus viridans, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiello oxytoca and Enterobacter aerogenes. This episodes were more frequent in the blood cultures obtained immediately after the ERCPs (p < 0.05), and occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics (p = 0.0192). Clinical manifestation of the episodes of bacteremia were not detected. CONCLUSION: The episodes of bacteremia occurred exclusively in the patients who were not receiving antibiotics, were transient and completely no symptomatic.
TI  - [The etiology of nosocomial infection in surgery: comparison of 2 years (1988 and 1996)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections (NI) make up an important problem in Public Health Care. From an etiologic point of view they are characterized by their constant evolution over time. Thus, the aim of this study was to know the etiologic variations of NI in the surgery departments of a university hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Active surveillance of NI in the departments of general, vascular and urologic surgery was undertaken in 1988 and 1996. The frequency of the presentation of different microorganisms was globally calculated and based on the localization of the infection. RESULTS: At present, the most important microorganisms were E. coli (20.6%), Enterococcus sp. (15.6%), S. epidermidis (8.8%), Streptococcus sp. (8.5%), other negative coagulase staphylococci (NCS) (5.7%), Pseudomonas sp. (5.5%), S. aureus (5.2%), and Candida sp. (4.3%). On analysis of the temporal evolution an increase was observed in gram positives (27.4% in 1988 and 46.4% in 1996). Enterococcus sp. increased in surgical infections (5.8% in 1988 and 15.8% in 1996) and in the urinary tract (8.5% in 1988 and 25.6% in 1996). Contrary to the S. epidermidis, the NCS increased in importance mainly in infections at the site of surgery (0% in 1988 to 5.1% in 1996). The appearance of Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp. and Proteus sp. decreased. CONCLUSIONS: A great variation was observed in the etiology of nosocomial infections in surgery departments not only over time but also based on the localization of the infection. In recent years gram positive infections have increased with a rise in the incidence of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci, in addition to greater protagonism by Candida sp.
TI  - Results of quantitative cultures of urine by free catch and catheterization from  healthy adult horses.
AB  - Quantitative urine cultures were performed on 11 male and 11 female healthy adult horses. Urine was collected by free catch and catheterization using standard methods. Results showed that all samples collected by free catch contained less than 20,000 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL. All samples collected by catheterization contained 500 CFU/mL or less. A significant difference was found between collection methods (P < .005), with catheterization having less contamination. In samples collected by free catch, females had significantly greater contamination than did males (P < .03). Predominant bacterial species isolated included Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Staphylococcus spp., Diptheroids sp., Proteus spp., and Enterococcus sp. Many samples contained multiple bacterial species. Bacterial isolates were representative of the normal bacterial flora of the equine urogenital tract. This paper establishes reference values for quantitative urine culture results in healthy adult horses to aid in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Infection by Strongyloides stercoralis in the county of Safor, Spain].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Strongyloides stercoralis is an endemic nematode in tropical and subtropical regions, but almost unknown in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to know some epidemiological, clinical and analytic features of this infection in our area (La Safor, Valencia), we performed a prospective study for 19 months. Through the search for the parasite in feces of patients with eosinophilia, we identified 37 subjects who were studied at diagnosis and 4 months later. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (89%) were currently, or had been agricultural workers, and thirty had worked barefooted and/or had drunk contaminated irrigation water. Twenty-three patients (62%) had a chronic or immunosuppressive diseases, and two of them on steroid treatment, developed a disseminated strongyloidiasis. Thirteen patients (35%) were asymptomatic; the rest had clinical manifestations attributed S. stercoralis, mainly digestive. Two of the patients with disseminated strongyloidiasis also had concomitant bacterial infections by Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus faecalis and Enterobacter sp. At diagnosis, besides eosinophilia, 86.5% had raised levels of IgE. Four months later treatment, the number of eosinophils was normal and IgE levels significantly decreased. The diagnostic yield of parasitic study of feces was increased with the number of samples examined. Thiabendazole achieved erradication of the parasite in 35 patients, and the other two died because of disseminated strongyloidiasis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of eosinophilia in patients from rural areas with subtropical climate should raise suspicion about infection by S. stercoralis, which, although sometimes is asymptomatic, may cause systemic bacterial infections in cases of hyperinfestation, specially when glucocorticoid treatment is given.
TI  - Treatment of PermCath-related sepsis in uremic patients.
AB  - Patients who use PermCath as the vascular access for long-term hemodialysis are occasionally confronted with catheter-related infections. Recently, we have treated 17 patients suffering from PermCath-related sepsis. The clinical presenting features were leukocytosis in 14/17, high fever and shaking chill during dialysis in 12/17, and signs of exit site infection in 3/17. No shock was found. All patients received clinical evaluation to exclude infection sources other than from blood and inside the catheter, such as pulmonary, genitourinary, hepatobiliary and cutaneous systems. Blood drawn from both PermCath and peripheral vein was sent for bacterial culture. Bacterial culture of the blood samples from PermCath revealed Staphylococcus sp. in 7/17, Pseudomonas sp. in 5/17, Enterobacter sp. in 4/17, Streptococcus sp. in 1/17. Fourteen blood samples from peripheral vein showed positive culture results identical to those from PermCath, but negative study were noted in three other patients. The patients were divided into two treatment groups: Group I: systemic antibiotics without PermCath removal in 7, Group II: "locked-in" retention in addition to systemic anti-biotics in 10. Antibiotics were empirically chosen according to bacteriological studies. In the "locked-in" retention treatment, antibiotics were retained into both the inflow and outflow PermCath lumens in the exact volume of each lumen for 24 hours. The antibiotics solutions were replaced on a daily basis. The same antibiotics were also given intravenously. Duration of treatment depended on clinical progression and follow-up blood culture results and ranged between 13 and 24 days. The schedule of dialysis was not changed through the period of PermCath-related sepsis. The sepsis was cured in all group II cases but not in 2 of group I and resulted in mortality in these 2 patients. The PermCaths were preserved in 5/7 in group I with two mortality cases and all except one preserved in group II patients without mortality. We suggested that "locked-in" retention in addition to systemic antibiotics is the treatment of choice for the patients with PermCath-related sepsis. This method also preserves the functional integrity of PermCath, which is the lifeline vascular access of the patients with exhausted native vessels.
TI  - Bacterial infection and semen characteristics in infertile men.
AB  - Semen samples of 190 men attending an andrology clinic were evaluated with bacteriological culture and categorized as negative (group I) and positive (group II); the effect of bacteriospemia on semen characteristics was also analyzed. Semen samples from both groups were simultaneously analyzed for routine parameters such as volume, sperm count, motility, viability and morphology. The semen culture was negative in 34% and positive in 66% of the samples. From 123 samples, 157 aerobes and 8 anaerobes were recovered. The most commonly isolated organism was Staphylococchs epidermidis (in 63% of the samples), followed by Streptococchs viridans (28%), Escherichia coli (9%), Staphylococcus aureus (5%), Streptococcus faecalis (5%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (4%), and Enterobacter agglomerans (4%). Other microorganisms, including Klebsiella sp, Candida sp., and Proteus mirabilis, were recovered in fewer than 4% of the specimens. The comparison of semen characteristics between infected and noninfected men showed that motile spermatozoa and viability were lower when the microorganisms were present in the semen. It would appear that the bacteria can have a direct effect on semen quality with negative consequences in fertility.
TI  - Antibiotics, biliary sepsis, and bile duct stones.
AB  - Bacteriologic studies of bile and blood cultures of 579 patients with ductal stones and infected bile revealed that 121 patients (21%) had associated bacteremia. Analysis of bile and stone cultures showed that Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Enterococcus sp, and Streptococcus sp were the most commonly isolated bacteria. Two-thirds of the patients with bacteremia had similar organisms isolated from blood and bile. Pharmacokinetic studies of the hepatic/biliary excretion profiles of ceftazidime, cefoperazone, imipenem, netilmicin, and ciprofloxacin were performed by ERCP and nasobiliary catheter drainage. The bile samples obtained immediately after cannulation from patients with complete biliary obstruction contained low or undetectable levels of the antibiotics administered--the exception being ciprofloxacin, which was present at a concentration of 20% of the serum level. In vitro determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of the aforementioned antibiotics against 199 isolates of biliary pathogens revealed imipenem and ciprofloxacin to have the highest antimicrobial activity. Based on pharmacokinetic studies and in vitro susceptibility findings, we conclude that ciprofloxacin is superior to the other tested antibiotics in prophylaxis and treatment of biliary sepsis.
TI  - [Clinical bacteriology and empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly at a national leprosarium].
AB  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia is one of the most important fatal respiratory diseases in the elderly. Prompt and precise empiric therapy is essential for recovery. Fourteen isolates from twelve elderly lepromatous leprosy patients (9 men, 3 women, mean age of 75.8 years) with hospital-acquired pneumonia were studied. Subsequently, empiric therapy with gentamicin and beta-lactams for nosocomial pneumonia in the elderly was examined. Fourteen types of bacteria isolated from expectorated sputum specimens consisted mainly of ten strains of gram-negative bacilli (71%) six of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one each of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Serratia liquefaciens, and Aeromonas hydrophilia and four strains of gram-positive cocci (29%) two of Staphylococcus sp., one each of Streptococcus sp. and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were not detected. Resistance rates of the etiologic agents to the antibiotics showed that gentamicin was 7.7%, ceftazidime 0%, and cefmetazole 23.1%. Cephalosporins were superior to penicillins. As a result of empiric therapy, six elderly leprosy patients with nosocomial pneumonia were cured and one improved temporarily. This study shows the necessity of specific empiric therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in a hospital with many elderly patients. The combination of gentamicin and beta-lactams is of value as an initial antibiotic therapy for hospital-acquired pneumonia in the elderly.
TI  - Microbiological studies of abscesses complicating Bothrops snakebite in humans: a prospective study.
AB  - Forty patients with abscesses at the site of Bothrops bite were evaluated. Ten brought the snake responsible for the bite, Bothrops jararaca in all cases. On admission a sample was collected from each case for aerobic and anaerobic culture, and no abscesses drained spontaneously. None of the patients had received antibacterial therapy at this time. The bacteria most frequently isolated were Morganella morganii (23 patients), Providencia rettgeri (7) Enterobacter sp. (4), Escherichia coli (3), group D streptococcus (11) and Bacteroides sp. (6). All enterobacteria tested were sensitive to chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and cefotaxime. Group D streptococci were sensitive to chloramphenicol, ampicillin and penicillin G, whereas anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. These results suggest that in cases of abscess formation secondary to Bothrops bite, chloramphenicol alone is a good choice, being both safe and cheap.
TI  - Bacterial meningitis in children: etiology and clinical features, an 11-year review of 618 cases.
AB  - During the period January 1980 to December 1990 (11 years) a retrospective study  of patients with bacterial meningitis who were admitted to Bangkok Children's Hospital was carried out. There were 618 patients with 77 cases (12.5%) occurring below the age of one month (neonatal meningitis), and 541 cases (87.5%) between one month to 15 years (childhood meningitis). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common pathogenic organism (16.9%) in neonatal meningitis; other causative agents in this age group included Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.0%), group B Streptococcus (11.7%), Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp (10.4% each). In childhood meningitis, Haemophilus influenzae was the most common causative organism (42.3%), and followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (22.2%) and Salmonella sp (12.4%). Excluding a 13 year-old leukemic patient, Salmonella meningitis occurred exclusively in infants, 87% of them were under six months, and 13% of them developed relapsing meningitis. Presenting symptoms and signs on admission of neonatal meningitis such as fever (81.8%), convulsions (45.4%), neck stiffness (22.5%), bulging fontanelle (33.3%) and Brudzinski sign (11.5%) were significantly less frequent than in the patients beyond the neonatal period (p < 0.05). The overall fatalities during 1980-1990 were 45.4% and 17.3% for neonatal meningitis and childhood meningitis, respectively. The fatalities of the two age groups declined significantly during 1987-1990 to 26.3% and 11.4% respectively.
TI  - The management of lateral sinus thrombosis.
AB  - The standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. For those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. Despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two. Both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. Amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature, and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Cloacal flora isolated from wild black-bellied whistling ducks (Dendrocygna autumnalis) in Laguna La Nacha, Mexico.
AB  - Cloacal swabs from 110 adult black-bellied whistling ducks trapped at Laguna La Nacha, Tamaulipas, Mexico, were cultured to determine the prevalence of normal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Twenty-five gram-negative enterobacteria and four gram-positive cocci were isolated. The most common isolates included Escherichia coli (54%), Staphylococcus spp. (29%), Streptococcus spp. (22%), Aeromonas hydrophila (15%) Enterobacter cloacae (14%), and Micrococcus sp. (14%). The implications of whistling ducks as possible reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria are discussed.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (PAPM/BP) in children. The results are summarized as follow: 1. Twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with PAPM/BP. Each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. Treatments were continued for 5-22 days. Clinical efficacies of PAPM/BP in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate of 91.7%. Seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (Haemophilus influenzae in 4, Branhamella catarrhalis in 3, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, Staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-Streptococcus in 1, Corynebacterium sp. in 1, Peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and Klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (S. aureus and P. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient No. 2). No adverse reactions were observed in any of the 12 patients. 2. MICs of PAPM were examined against 22 clinical isolates (H. influenzae 5, B. catarrhalis 3, alpha-Streptococcus 3, S. pneumoniae 2, Corynebacterium sp. 2, S. aureus 1, P. aeruginosa 1, P. micros 1, Enterobacter cloacae 1, Escherichia coli 1, Group D Streptococcus 1 and Staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. PAPM showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (CPZ) against S. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. However, the activity of PAPM against H. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of CPZ. 3. Pharmacokinetic studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic and clinical studies on cefpirome in pediatrics].
AB  - Cefpirome (CPR, HR 810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its pharmacokinetics, bacteriological and clinical effects in the field of pediatrics. 1. CPR was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae among Gram-positive cocci. Antibacterial activities of CPR were also strong against Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa among Gram-negative rods. 2. The plasma concentration 15 minutes after a bolus intravenous injection of 20 mg/kg was 80.4 micrograms/ml, and the T 1/2 (beta) was 1.03 hours. Plasma concentrations after intravenous drip infusion over 30 minutes of 20 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg were 48.3 and 117 micrograms/ml at the end of infusion, and T 1/2 (beta) for these dosage were 1.14 and 1.45 hours. 3. The urinary recovery rates over 6 hours after administration were 45.2-63.9% for CPR. 4. Clinical efficacies of CPR were excellent in 31 patients and good in 30 patients with an efficacy rate of 98.4%. In bacteriological examinations, causative organisms were eradicated with an eradication rate of 95.7%. 5. As side effects, diarrhea was observed in 5 patients and loose stool in 1 patient with an incidence of 8.2%. Abnormal values were found in some patients in clinical laboratory tests for eosinophilia, thrombocytosis and an elevation of GOT, GPT and triglyceride. These findings indicate that CPR will be useful against bacterial infections in pediatrics.
TI  - A randomized prospective study of ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with or without teicoplanin as an empiric antibiotic regimen for febrile neutropenic patients.
AB  - Febrile neutropenic patients were randomized to receive ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin with the addition of teicoplanin in cases with clinical suspicion of a Hickman line-associated infection. At 48 h both clinical and bacteriological analyses were made. Patients were categorized as: success, in cases of improvement or stability in the clinical condition; failure, if there was a deterioration of the clinical condition; and non-evaluable, in cases of protocol violation or death due to other causes. A total of 86 patients have completed the study so far; 43 patients were randomized to the ceftazidime and 43 to the ciprofloxacin group. Teicoplanin was added to the monotherapy in 12 patients in the ceftazidime group and 15 in the ciprofloxacin group. The diagnoses were: acute myelogenous leukaemia (25), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (34), Hodgkin's disease (17); acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (9) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (1). Forty-eight hour clinical assessment showed a response rate in the ceftazidime group of: success 18/31 (58%), failure 13/31 (42%); in the ceftazidime and teicoplanin group: success 8/12 (67%), failure 4/12 (33%); in the ciprofloxacin group: success 23/28 (82%), failure 5/28 (18%); and in the ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin group: success 11/15 (73%), failure 4/15 (27%). Blood cultures were positive in 48/86 (56%) cases, with more than one organism isolated in seven of these 48 cases. Organisms isolated were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (20), Escherichia coli (13), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Staphylococcus aureus (3), diphtheroids (3), Klebsiella sp. (3), Enterobacter cloacae (2), Streptococcus faecalis (2), Ent. adenocarboxylata (1), Clostridium septicum (1). Strept. B (1), alpha streptococcus (1) and P. fluorescens (1), In-vitro testing showed that all Gram-positive organisms were sensitive to teicoplanin, and Gram-negative organisms to ciprofloxacin or ceftazidime. There were seven cases of superimposed infections with eight organisms isolated, all cases occurring in patients receiving ciprofloxacin alone: coagulase-negative staphylococci (4), Strep. sangius (1), Strep. viridans (1), diphtheroids (1) and P. maltophilia (1). Both ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime are comparable in efficacy as empirical monotherapy for febrile neutropenic patients. There is, however, a significant increase in the incidence of superimposed infection in patients receiving only ciprofloxacin. In view of the very high incidence of Gram-positive septicaemia, we suggest that teicoplanin should be added as part of the initial empiric antibiotic regimen in all febrile neutropenic patients.
TI  - Use of potentially infected donor hearts for cardiac transplantation.
AB  - Despite the nationwide shortage of heart donors, more patients, some of whom are  critically ill, are being accepted as candidates for transplantation. Thus, on occasion, we have liberalized our donor criteria to meet the demand. We have recently transplanted 16 potentially infected donor hearts into critically ill recipients. Of these 16 donors, 7 had multiple positive blood cultures as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae (3), Staphylococcus aureus (2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1), and Enterobacter sp (1). Seven other donors were accepted despite high fevers (rectal temperature greater than 38.9 degrees C), leukocytosis (greater than 18 x 10(9)/L [greater than 18,000 cells/microL]), and pulmonary infiltrates with positive sputa (Enterobacter [3], Klebsiella pneumoniae [2], and Staphylococcus [2]). Two other donors with hepatitis B surface antigen positivity were deemed at high risk but were used because the recipients were in immediate need. Early mortality (less than or equal to 30 days) among the recipients was 3/16 (18.7%) with 1 patient dying of uncontrolled allograft rejection, 1 of hepatic failure, and 1 of Pseudomonas septicemia. Late mortality (greater than 30 days after operation) occurred in 6 patients: 2 patients died of hepatic failure, 3 died of graft atherosclerosis, and 1 died of iatrogenic hemorrhage after a liver biopsy. Only 1 patient died of infection unrelated to that of the donor, and the other patients had no infectious complications resulting from the organisms identified in their respective donors. Use of potentially infected donor hearts resulted in surprisingly few infectious complications in this group of recipients. This practice can be safe and should be considered when other options are unavailable.
TI  - Evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of Salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  - Thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. Positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (TSB). As blood cultures are often used for the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of Salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in TSB. Routine blood culture samples from Yonsei Medical Center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of TSB and thiol broth. The media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain CO2, but TSB contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Growth of S. paratyphi-A, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were similar in both media. However, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in TSB with S. typhi, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. It is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to TSB plus SPS for the culture of S. typhi from blood.
TI  - Microwave: practical cost-effective method for sterilizing urinary catheters in the home.
AB  - We used a standard microwave oven to sterilize red rubber catheters used for intermittent self-catheterization. Catheters were incubated for sixty minutes in a suspension of microorganisms isolated from the urine of patients with urinary tract infections. For each trial, 6 catheters were removed from their respective suspensions, placed in separate plastic freezer bags, distributed evenly in a microwave oven (avoiding cold spots), and microwaved simultaneously for twelve minutes. A control catheter was not microwaved. Two strains of each microorganism were tested. The urinary isolates were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus sp., Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., and Candida sp. In each experiment, all 6 catheters were sterilized. Repeat sterilization in the microwave oven did not affect the integrity of the catheters or the plastic bags. A water heat sink of constant volume was employed. A home microwave oven may be used as a method to sterilize red rubber catheters for reuse with a recommended time of twelve minutes at full power. This technique makes aseptic intermittent self-catheterization a practical possibility.
TI  - Bacteriological study of extracted IUCDs.
TI  - [Impact of infections on mortality in children with cancer].
AB  - A study of the role infections play in the death of 29 children with cancer was conducted from 1983 to 1988. An infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of their death. The most frequently found etiological agents found in hemocultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp and Candida spp. A retrospective study on the role of infections in the death of children with cancer was conducted. The clinical and autopsy records of 29 children who died between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. Infection was the main cause of death in twelve patients and was associated with hemorrhage in nine. Five of the patients were free of infection at the time of death. The most frequent etiologic agents found in blood cultures taken while still alive were: Staphylococcus epidermidis.
TI  - [Studies on 145 cases of septicemia in infancy and childhood--especially on septicemic patients with malignant and hematological diseases].
AB  - Clinical and bacteriological data of 145 inpatients with septicemia, treated at the hospital of Chiba University School of Medicine from 1972 to 1987, were reviewed by dividing them into three stages. (stages I: 1972-76, stage II: 1978-82, stage III: 1983-87) Patients with underlying diseases have been increasing: 91.8% of the total patients in stage III. Among the patients with underlying diseases, malignant and hematological diseases occupied about 60%, and in the other diseases, congenital heart diseases have been increasing in number. As to the organisms isolated, gram positive bacteria have increased, while gram negative bacteria have decreased. In stage III, the rate of gram positive organisms and gram negative ones accounted for 43.1% and 41.2% of all the isolates from the septic patients with malignant & hematological diseases, respectively. In patients with malignant & hematological diseases, alpha-streptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and Fusobacterium sp. have been increasing, whereas, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa decreasing. In patients with other underlying diseases, S. aureus, CNS, and non Fermenters have been increasing. Among the patients without underlying diseases, gram positive bacteria accounted for the major part. The decrease of gram negative organisms in patients with malignant and hematological diseases may partially depend on the introduction of polymixin B as the drug of gut decontamination. The outcome of septicemia in the patients with malignant & hematological diseases has been markedly improving through all the three stages. During stage III, episode mortality and case mortality rate proved to be 23% and 31%, respectively. The introduction of the third generation cephems has decreased the mortality rate for gram negative organisms and contributed to the improvement of the total prognosis. The prognosis was worst in the case of P. aeruginosa, showing a mortality rate of 50% during stage III. Coincidence rate of blood and other cultures have been largest in the case of P. aeruginosa, so, the drug sensitivity of the strain cultured from other sites is sometimes useful in the choice of antibiotics.
TI  - [Frequency of germ isolation from urinary infections in community practice; their sensitivity to 7 antibiotics including a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Evaluation on 1611 samples].
AB  - A multicenter study including 10 outpatient private laboratories (hospital laboratories excluded) was carried out in France. 1,611 urines samples from patients with UTI were collected during the forth trimester of 1987. The most frequently recovered pathogens were: E. coli (71%), Proteus mirabilis (9%), Staphylococcus coagulase (6%), Klebsiella (6%), Enterobacter (2%). Other sorts (Streptococcus D, Proteus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp) were infrequent (less than 1%). The sensitivity of the aerobic Gram-negative bacteria to ampicillin, clavulanic acid-amoxicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, pipemidic acid, norfloxacin and co-trimoxazole was tested.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility to a new antimicrobial agent (imipenem) of pathogens isolated from inpatients at various centers].
AB  - Imipenem is a beta lactam antibiotic, a highly potent new carbapenem with broad antibacterial spectrum. To test the "in vitro" efficacy of this antimicrobial agent in pathogens more frequent in several Medical Centers in Brazil, susceptibility testing with 10 mcg imipenem disks and, or corresponding MIC were carried out with 1231 recent isolates of 41 different bacterial species, obtained mainly from hospitalized patients in 5 different medical centers of the cities of S. Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador. Our preliminary results with this antibiotic, in final phases of clinical and laboratorial experimentation in this country, are very promissing with, 96.79% of susceptibility of test isolates to 10 mcg imipenem disks and corresponding MIC correlation of up to 4 micrograms/ml. (92.31%). Of the 9 bacterial species more frequently isolated totaling 1108 (82%) of the 1230 test isolates, disk susceptibility was 99% (E. coli), 93% (Pseudomonas aeruginosas), 87% (Staphylococcus aureus), 100% (Klebsiella pneumoniae), 98% (Klebsiella sp), 97% (Proteus mirabiles), 94% (Enterobacter sp), 100% (Streptococcus faecalis) with good MIC correlation (up to 8 mcg/ml) and 100% for the anaerobic species Bacteroides sp (MIC up to 4 micrograms/ml). "In vitro" efficacy to hospital pathogens with high frequency of resistance to most antibiotics as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and to anaerobes notably Bacteroides sp is emphasized.
TI  - [Clinical experience of chemotherapy with cefmetazole for severe infections accompanying malignant hematological disorders].
AB  - We made an attempt to treat with cefmetazole (CMZ) 25 patients who developed severe infectious diseases while suffering with granulocytopenia associated with the treatment of malignant hematological disorders. 1. Determination of bacteriological efficacy While 20 strains were isolated and identified from 15 patients, no significant bacteria were detected in 9 patients. Isolates obtained were: 5 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 3 strains of Haemophilus influenzae, 2 strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 strains of Klebsiella oxytoca, 2 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, and 1 strain each of Neisseria sp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Enterobacter sp., alpha-Streptococcus, beta-Streptococcus and Gram-positive cocci. Causative organisms were eradicated or markedly in 7 of the 15 patients from whom bacteria were isolated. Clinical findings, including fever, revealed that none of the patients, in whom bacteriological efficacy was determined to be poor, exhibited sufficient clinical response. E. faecalis was isolated from 4 of 6 patients bacteriologically determined to have no response. 2. As for 23 patients, who were found to be evaluable among the 25 patients, 8 (34.8%), 4 (17.4%), 4 (17.4%), and 7 (30.4%) demonstrated excellent, good, fair and poor responses, respectively, showing a 69.6% efficacy rate which indicates a sum of percentages of patients with excellent, good and fair responses. 3. While an efficacy rate of 100% was obtained for 3 patients with number of peripheral neutrophils less than 500/mm3 before the beginning of CMZ administration, only an efficacy rate of 66.7% was obtained for 15 patients with neutrophils more than 500/mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Efficacy and safety of cefpirome (HR810).
AB  - Sixty adult patients with suspected systemic bacterial infections were treated with cefpirome 1 g or 2 g twice daily for 5-22 days. Forty-seven patients were evaluable for clinical efficacy. Diagnoses in evaluable patients were urinary tract infections (20), pneumonia (10), soft tissue infections (17), and bone and joint infections (4); four patients had two infections each. Nine patients were bacteraemic and all were cured; the responsible bacteria were Escherichia coli (6), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1), and Haemophilus influenzae (1). One patient with a soft tissue infection failed to respond clinically to cefpirome. Bacteriologically, 41 of 48 isolated pathogens (85%) were eradicated. In wound cultures, three strains of Staphylococcus aureus and one each of Ps. aeruginosa and Str. faecalis persisted. One Enterobacter sp. relapsed in urine. Of isolated strains, only Str. faecalis and methicillin resistant Staph, epidermidis were resistant to cefpirome. Staph, aureus strains were inhibited in vitro by 0.25 to 2 mg/l of cefpirome in agar dilution. Adverse effects, probably or possibly related to cefpirome, were skin reactions (3), fever (1), Clostridium difficile diarrhoea (2), and disturbed taste sensation (1). Tolerance was good. Cefpirome is suitable for large-scale comparative trials.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies of norfloxacin in respiratory tract infections].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a new quinolone antibacterial agent, was investigated for its antibacterial activity and clinical efficacy on respiratory tract infections. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. Antibacterial activities were evaluated against 127 strains of various bacteria isolated from clinical sources. MIC80's of this drug were: against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes 1.56 micrograms/ml; Haemophilus influenzae 0.05 microgram/ml or less; and Klebsiella sp. and Enterobacter sp. 0.10 microgram/ml. These antibacterial activities were superior to these of ampicillin and cephalexin, except against S. pyogenes. 2. Clinical responses to NFLX in a total of 32 cases with respiratory tract infections were excellent in 9 cases, good in 12, fair in 9, poor in 2, with an efficacy rate of 65.6%. Neither adverse reactions nor abnormalities of laboratory test results were observed.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Osteomyelitis secondary to trauma or infected contiguous soft tissue.
AB  - Nonhematogenous osteomyelitis (NHO) occurred in 24 pediatric patients (ages 8 months to 18 years; median, 14 years; 23 male) admitted from 1980 to 1985. Predisposing factors included compound fracture (12), deep decubiti (4) and foot puncture (3). Infection involved tibia (7), foot bones (6), proximal femur (3) and ulna (2). Patients presented with drainage (64%), pain or tenderness (44%) and fever (32%) lasting for 1 to 180 days (median, 10 days). In 24% both white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Initial radiographs were nondiagnostic in 42% after compound fractures. Bone cultures were positive in 15 of 18 (83%) patients for: Staphylococcus aureus (9), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), Escherichia coli (2), Enterobacter sp. (2), Streptococcus faecalis, Serratia sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens (1 each). Wound cultures failed to predict bone culture results in 12 of 16 patients (75%). NHO recurred in 8 of 19 patients (42%) despite intravenously administered antibiotics for greater than 28 days and debridement in 7 of 8 patients. The indolent nature of NHO complicates diagnosis, especially in patients with recent compound fractures. Only prompt bone culture can confirm the presence of NHO and reliably guide antimicrobial therapy.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - In vitro activity of two new aryl-fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620 compared to that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of difloxacin (A-56619) and A-56620, two new aryl-difluoroquinolones, was compared to that of other new quinolones and several parenteral and oral antimicrobial agents. A-56620 inhibited 90% of Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, Staphylococcus aureus 0.25 micrograms/ml, hemolytic streptococci 2 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 micrograms/ml, Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium at 8 micrograms/ml. A-56620 was equal or 2-fold more active than norfloxacin and ofloxacin, and 2-8-fold less active than ciprofloxacin. Difloxacin had similar in vitro activity with many isolates but usually was 2-8-fold less active than A-56620. Both agents inhibited beta-lactamase positive Haemophilus influenzae (MIC 0.015 micrograms/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MK less than or equal to 0.008 micrograms/ml). Both agents were more active against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae than norfloxacin, ofloxacin and enoxacin, but not more active than ciprofloxacin. They inhibited Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cephalosporins and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Spontaneously resistant mutants were seen with Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a frequency similar to that found for other new quinolones. These agents show overall in vitro activity comparable to other quinolones in clinical trial or recently approved for clinical use.
TI  - [Pyogenic hepatic abscess].
AB  - Ten patients, 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 53 years, having pyogenic liver abscess, were studied to review the principal features of the clinical and bacteriological diagnosis. In 9 cases the abscess was located in the right hepatic lobe. Bacteriological diagnosis was made in 6 cases: the etiology was nonmicrobian in 3 and two microorganisms were found in the other 3 cases. The isolated pathogens were: Escherichia coli (3 cases), Staphylococcus sp (3 cases), Enterobacter agglomerans (1 case), Citrobacter sp (1 case), Streptococcus sp (1 case). The basic clinical pattern included fever in 9 patients, pain in upper right side of the abdomen in 8, jaundice in 5 and respiratory symptoms in 5. In 2 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, in 2 by scintigraphy and in 3 both methods were used. Surgical drainage was practiced in 7 patients, with favorable course in 6. Three patients were not operated; 2 died and the third was cured with medical treatment. The importance of the clinical suspicion even with few data is pointed out, specially prolonged fever with painful syndrome in upper right side of the abdomen. The aid of the diagnosis imaging is valuable for verification. The precise bacteriological diagnosis by culture of the material obtained in surgery or by percutaneous drainage of the abscess allows the selection of the most suitable antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Osteoarticular infections in children with sickle cell disease.
AB  - Thirteen children with sickle cell disease were identified as having 14 episodes  of osteoarticular infection in a review of 27 years' experience. There were eight episodes of osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis and six of suppurative arthritis alone. The etiologic agents in osteomyelitis or osteoarthritis were Salmonella sp in four cases, Escherichia coli in one, Enterobacter aerogenes in one, Staphylococcus aureus in one, and Haemophilus influenzae type b in one. Five of the cases with infection limited to the joint were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae; the sixth was caused by H influenzae type b. Fever (greater than or equal to 38.3 degrees C) was present in all children and the temperature was in excess of 39 degrees C in 62%. The mean duration of pain before admission was 4.5 days. The initial total white blood cell count ranged from 5,200 to 29,700/microL (mean 19,436/microL) and the total band neutrophil count ranged from 0 to 5,103/microL (mean 1,660/microL). The ESR was greater than 20 mm/h in eight of the ten patients who were tested. Management consisted of antibiotic therapy in all. Needle aspiration was performed in two patients with osteomyelitis and in three with suppurative arthritis. Incision and drainage was performed in two cases of osteomyelitis and in four with suppurative arthritis. The outcome was satisfactory in all except one patient who had several complications as a consequence of femoral neck osteomyelitis. Recurrence was reported in only one patient.
TI  - [Bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  - During six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. All the specimens investigated were taken from patients of surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. In total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like Staphylococus aureus, Straphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. Out of the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by Enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive Proteus species. The over all isolation rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. In the last time Pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional Streptococcus faecium and Corynebacterium JK. Dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like Bacteroides sp., Peptococcus- and Peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in the infectious diseases. The epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. From there preventive measures must be induced.
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 15-8074 and Ro 19-5247, two orally administered cephalosporin metabolites.
AB  - The activity of two iminomethoxy aminothiazoly cephalosporins, Ro 15-8074 and Ro  19-5247, was compared with that of other beta-lactams against a total of 491 bacterial strains. Both were highly active (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC 90], less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml) against the majority of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae, being at least 16-fold more active than cephalexin and 8-fold more active than cefuroxime. There was no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and poor activity against Morganella morganii (in the case of Ro 15-8074), Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. Staphylococcus aureus was moderately susceptible to Ro 19-5247 (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml), but Ro 15-8074 was eightfold less active. The protein binding of the two compounds at 5 micrograms/ml was 9.1% for Ro 15-8074 and 69.9% for Ro 19-5247. The major target site for the two cephalosporins was PBP 3.
TI  - Susceptibility testing with disc diffusion for new cephalosporins: pre-diffusion  revisited.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of 20-hour pre-diffusion, i.e. placing the antibiotic-containing discs on the agar for 20 hours prior to inoculation, as compared to direct diffusion, i.e. placing the discs on the agar immediately after inoculation, for the newer 3. generation cephalosporins as represented by ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Regression lines (zone sizes vs. inhibitory concentrations, as measured by plate-dilution) were constructed for three groups of bacteria chosen because of their differences in growth characteristics on agar: E. coli (n = 50), Enterobacter sp. (n = 35), and streptococci (n = 51). The results for both cephalosporins were: 20-hour pre-diffusion produced larger zones than direct diffusion, regression studies for 20-hour pre-diffusion as compared to direct diffusion resulted in greater variation in zone sizes, numerically lower slopes, lower residual variances and higher correlation coefficients, and regression lines were significantly different for the 3 groups of bacteria with direct diffusion but not so with 20-hour pre-diffusion. Considering the interpretation of zone sizes with disc diffusion for the cephalosporins tested, 20-hour pre-diffusion was superior to direct diffusion.
TI  - [Fundamental and clinical studies of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the field of obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  - Fundamental and clinical studies of a new carbapenem antibiotic, imipenem/cilastatin sodium (MK-0787/MK-0791), were carried out to evaluate the drug in treating infections of the female genital organs. The following results were obtained: In 4 patients undergoing hysterectomy, the penetration of MK-0787 and MK-0791 into female genital organ tissues was studied following a 30-minute intravenous drip infusion of MK-0787/MK-0791 500 mg/500 mg. Plasma levels of MK-0787 and MK-0791 in cubital venous blood following the drip infusion peaked at 0 minute with values of 51.2 micrograms/ml and 61.9 micrograms/ml, respectively, then decreased to 1.9 micrograms/ml and 0.7 microgram/ml, respectively, at 201 minutes. MK-0787 penetrated readily to female genital organ tissues and levels of the drug exceeded 0.5 approximately 1.9 micrograms/g in various organ tissues at 201 minutes following an intravenous drip infusion of 500 mg/500 mg of MK-0787/MK-0791. Clinically, MK-0787/MK-0791 was used for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections at a dosage of 500 mg/500 mg twice daily by intravenous drip infusion. Clinical effects of MK-0787/MK-0791 were analyzed in 22 patients, including 9 patients with intrauterine infections, 7 with intrapelvic infections, 5 with adnexitis, and 1 with an external genital infection. Excellent responses were seen in 5 patients (22.7%), good responses in 15 (68.2%), and poor responses in 2 (9.1%). The efficacy ratio was 90.9%. After the treatment, 15 out of 18 isolates were eradicated for an 83.3% eradication rate. All strains of S. epidermidis (2 strains), Eubacterium lentum (1 strain), Peptococcus sp. (1 strain), beta-Streptococcus (1 strain), Gram-positive rods (2 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (1 strain), Bacteroides bivius (1 strain), Pseudomonas sp. (1 strain), Pseudomonas cepacia (1 strain) and Gram-negative rods (1 strain) were eradicated by the MK-0787/MK-0791 treatment. The safety of the drug was analyzed in 22 patients, effects occurred in 3 (13.6%). Among those 3 patients, diarrhea occurred in 1 patient, rash in another and nausea and vomiting in yet another. One patient had an increased BUN after the MK-0787/MK-0791 treatment. In the other 21 patients, no abnormalities in creatinine, GOT, GPT, or T. Bil. values were observed. It may be concluded that MK-0787/MK-0791 is useful for the treatment of obstetrical and gynecological infections.
TI  - [Aerobic bacterial flora of the nasal cavity of rabbits].
AB  - On the basis of bacteriological examinations carried out in April 1984 on 60 intranasal swabs, aerobic respiratory microbes were studied in rabbits. Differences in flora between animals with and without respiratory diseases were studied. Fourteen bacterial species were identified with no difference due to the pathological status. They were: Bordetella bronchiseptica, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Branhamella catarrhalis, Micrococcus sp., Enterobacter agglomerans, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas paucimobilis, Pseudomonas diminuta, Alcaligenes faecalis and Escherichia coli. However, young weaned rabbits were more often Pasteurella carriers than adult females in maternity. The usefulness of performing only Pasteurella and Bordetella cultures in rabbits is questionable as is use of vaccines in order to prevent bacterial respiratory syndrome. It is emphasised that myxomatosis should be pursued in the investigation of respiratory infections in rabbit.
TI  - Cefadroxil in the horse: pharmacokinetics and in vitro antibacterial activity.
AB  - Sodium cefadroxil was administered as a single intravenous dose (25 mg/kg) to six healthy adult mares. Plasma samples were collected over a 24-h period and cefadroxil concentrations were measured by microbiological assay. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug was appropriately described in terms of a one-compartment open model. Values for the major pharmacokinetic terms were: extrapolated initial plasma concentration = 59.2 +/- 15.0 micrograms/ml; half-life = 46 +/- 20 min; apparent volume of distribution = 462 +/- 191 ml/kg; and body clearance = 7.0 +/- 0.6 ml/min.kg. In a subsequent study, a suspension of cefadroxil monohydrate was administered intragastrically (25 mg/kg) to the same six horses. Plasma concentrations of the drug peaked at 1-2 h but, in general, absorption was both poor and inconsistent. The data were unsuitable for determination of cefadroxil bioavailability from this oral dosage form. Ninety-nine isolates of eleven bacterial species obtained from clinically ill horses were tested for susceptibility to cefadroxil. All strains of Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and five out of six strains of Actinobacillus suis were highly susceptible to the drug (MIC less than 4 micrograms/ml). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella sp. showed intermediate susceptibility (MIC 4-16 micrograms/ml), while all isolates of Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa proved to be highly resistant to cefadroxil (MIC greater than 128 micrograms/ml).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Bacteraemia at the University Hospital of the West Indies--a report of 222 cases.
AB  - A total of 222 cases of septicaemia was recorded at the University Hospital of the West Indies between June 1982 and June 1983. This gave an overall incidence of 16.1 per 1000 admissions. The 233 bacterial strains isolated comprised 100 Gram-positive and 133 Gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent. Highest rates of septicaemia were recorded in patients less than 1 year and over 50 years of age. Septicaemia caused by Gram-positive organisms was predominantly a disease of children whereas that caused by Gram-negative organisms arose more often in neonates and in patients over 50 years of age. A predisposing factor was noted in 104 patients of whom 42 had neoplastic disease. The most frequently identified initial sites of infection were the respiratory tract, the gastro-intestinal tract and the meninges. Most blood stream infections were community-acquired, three quarters of all septicaemic patients being admitted to the departments of medicine or paediatrics. There were 11 cases of polymicrobial septicaemia caused predominantly by Gram-negative organisms in patients with underlying disease. Appropriate antimicrobial drugs were administered to 57% of septicaemic patients whereas 17% received superfluous antimicrobial therapy. In those patients who received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy there was a marked increase in mortality. Forty of 61 deaths were attributed to septicaemia. Mortality from septicaemia caused by Gram-negative organisms was 21% compared with 13% for that caused by Gram-positive organisms. The organisms associated with the highest case fatality rates were Escherichia coli, 53%; Enterobacter sp., 27%; and beta-haemolytic streptococci 24%. There were no deaths from septicaemia caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Salmonella sp. or Serratia sp. The highest mortality rates were associated with neoplastic disease, diabetes, polymicrobial septicaemia, urinary tract infections and old age.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Susceptibility of equine bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobic susceptibility patterns of commonly isolated aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens of equine origin were determined, using the agar-plate dilution method. All organisms were recent clinical isolates and included Corynebacterium (Rhodococcus) equi, Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, (coagulase positive) Staphylococcus sp, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Actinobacillus sp, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella. In vitro susceptibility levels were outlined for 14 antimicrobics as follows: amikacin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, ampicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, amoxicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, cefadroxil less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, chloramphenicol less than or equal to 8.0 micrograms/ml, erythromycin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, gentamicin less than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml, kanamycin less than or equal to 4.0 micrograms/ml, penicillin less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, tetracycline less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml, sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, ormetoprim/sulfadimethoxine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml, sulfadiazine less than or equal to 10.0 micrograms/ml, and trimethoprim/sulfadiazine less than or equal to 0.5/9.5 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of three new quinolone antibiotics against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - New orally absorbable quinolone derivatives, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and ofloxacin demonstrated excellent activity in vitro against clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus sp. indole-positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci. None of the 3 drugs was more than moderately effective against Bacteroides fragilis. Ciprofloxacin was 2-4 times more effective against most gram-negative strains than was either norfloxacin or ofloxacin, and was also the most effective against gram-positive strains, though the difference was less marked. Ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were almost equally effective against S. aureus. Results with agar and with broth were comparable. The activities of all 3 drugs were essentially independent of inoculum size, as the MIC values increased less than one dilution step when the inoculum was increased from 10(3) to 10(6). The new quinolone derivatives would appear to be promising alternatives to injectable drugs such as the aminoglycosides and cephalosporins.
TI  - Distribution and effects of a defined six-member murine-derived microflora in gnotobiotic gerbils.
AB  - The gnotobiotic gerbil was selected as a model with which to study the effects of colonization with a defined microflora on organ morphology, histology, and selected blood biochemical parameters. Gerbils were maintained germfree for 13 months but failed to reproduce, presumably because of the enlarged cecum. A colony of gnotobiotic gerbils that was associated with a bacterial flora consisting of Lactobacillus brevis, Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Enterobacter aerogenes, and a Fusobacterium sp. was established. These gnotobiotic gerbils had smaller ceca than germfree gerbils and proved capable of reproduction. Except for the presence of large numbers of Bacteroides organisms in the stomach and greater numbers of S. epidermidis in gnotobiotic gerbils, the number and location of gastrointestinal bacteria were similar in conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils. Bacteroides sp. was the second most predominant microorganism present in gnotobiotic gerbils, whereas clostridia were reported to be the second most predominant microorganism in conventional gerbils. Microscopic examination of direct-impression smears indicated that fusobacteria were present on mucosal surfaces. Intestines of gnotobiotic gerbils weighed twice as much as the intestines of conventional gerbils. Intestinal tissue water weight values from conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils were similar. Histological examination of gerbil intestinal tissue revealed no cellular hypertrophy and no evidence of inflammation in gnotobiotic gerbil intestines. Spleens of gnotobiotic gerbils showed no germinal center stimulation. Statistical differences in total serum glucose, serum protein, and hematocrit levels were found between conventional and gnotobiotic gerbils.
TI  - [Effect of solid substrates of microbial colony development].
AB  - Bacteria have been found to grow differently at contact sites to both organic and anorganic solids as on pure agar media. Of 16 ad hoc selected bacterial strains, the following species (arranged in decreasing order) responded with stronger colony formation: Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Streptococcus sanguis, S. saprophyticus, S. faecalis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus flavus, Actinomyces viscosus, Veillonella sp., Enterobacter liquefaciens, Yersinia enterocolitica. Lactobacillus casei behaved neutral. Proteus vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica and Chromobacterium violaceum grow on certain media only in the presence of solid particles. The yeasts Endomyces lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa and Cryptococcus nigricans did not respond to solid particles during colony formation. The kind of protein-animal (meat) or vegetable (soy beans)-did not influence the behaviour of the microorganisms in these experiments.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - Superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  - We reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. The factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). Eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. Gram-negative rods were found in six cases (Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Achromobacter sp.). Gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were found in six cases (Staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; S. aureus, two cases; and Streptococcus sp., two cases). Fungal superinfections were found in three cases (Cephalosporium acremonium, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). Mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.
TI  - Direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  - In a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (Bennett MA-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (APHA guidelines) dilutions. The paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (P less than 0.001). Seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. The direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) CFU/ml. High densities of organisms frequently were found. Sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. The contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas maltophilia, and Flavobacterium meningosepticum. Fermenters were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, and Enterobacter agglomerans. Infrequently, gram-positive Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were noted.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluation of parenteral moxalactam in infants and children.
AB  - Thirty-four infants and children ranging in age from 2.5 to 180 months (mean, 40  months) were treated with parenteral moxalactam (150 mg/kg per day) for suspected or proved bacterial infections outside the central nervous system. Six patients infected with Haemophilus influenzae b, nine infected with Staphylococcus aureus, three infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae, one infected with Streptococcus pyogenes, one infected with Enterobacter aerogenes, one infected with Fusobacterium nucleotum, and one infected with Staphylococcus epidermidis, microaerophilic streptococcus, and Propionibacterium sp. were clinically and bacteriologically cured. One patient with polymicrobial pansinusitis did not respond to moxalactam. No patients developed meningitis. All of the isolates tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 5 micrograms of moxalactam per ml, except for one Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate which was resistant to greater than 20 micrograms/ml. Five patients had transient neutropenia which resolved after the drug was discontinued. The mean peak serum level was 106 micrograms/ml at 15 min after a 50-mg/kg dose. The mean elimination half-life was 91.2 min. These data indicate that this dosage of moxalactam is a safe and effective treatment for bacterial infections outside the central nervous system.
TI  - [Sensitivity of bacteria to chemotherapeutic agents (Zurich 1980). Part I. Bacteria isolated from hospital patients].
AB  - The frequency with which various bacteria are isolated from samples of hospitalized patients and the occurrence of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in these bacteria are described. Data were collected and summarized by an electronic data processing system. Sensitivity data were obtained with the disc diffusion test carried out by the Bauer/Kirby method. E. coli and S. aureus were the most frequently isolated organisms. Pseudomonas sp. (in 90% Pseud. aeruginosa) took second place behind E. coli among gramnegative rod bacteria. As a rule more than 50% of grampositive and gramnegative bacteria were sensitive to betalactam antibiotics and broad spectrum agents. Aminocyclitols were the most potent drugs. Strains resistant to netilmicin or amikacin were only exceptionally observed. A comparison of the occurrence of sensitive bacteria from 1975 to 1980 revealed that with rare exceptions no decrease of sensitivity to standard drug occurred in E. coli, the Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia group, Pseudo. aeruginosa and S. aureus.
TI  - Cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  - The safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. The antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. Seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. Forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus. Other pathogens included Streptococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as Bacteroides fragilis. The drug was well tolerated. Pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. Cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
TI  - Clinical trials with cefoperazone in the field of internal medicine in Japan.
AB  - A total of 466 patients were treated with cefoperazone. The drug was usually administered by drip infusion of 2 to 4 gm/day. Therapy was described as markedly effective and moderately effective in 64 of 77 patients (83.1%) treated for urinary tract infections; 253 of 316 patients (80.1%) treated for respiratory infections; 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) treated for liver biliary duct infections; ten of 16 patients (62.5%) treated for septicemia; and seven of nine patients (77.8%) being treated for other infections. Overall, cefoperazone was effective 79.6% of all patients treated. With respect to bacteriological activity, the overall eradication rate for gram-negative organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter sp, and Proteus sp) was 81% (182/225) and for gram-positive (Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) 90% (36/40). Of 205 patients who failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy, 67.8% were treated effectively with cefoperazone. Side effects, such as skin eruption, pyrexia and diarrhea, occurred in only 4.8% of patients treated, while laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and eosinophil values, occurred in only 6.4% of the treated patients. None of these abnormal values were of clinical significance.
TI  - A comparison of the in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, cefuroxime, and cephalothin against 810 clinical isolates.
AB  - 810 strains of eight species: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis,  Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp, Enterobacter sp, Proteus mirabilis and Proteus vulgaris, were tested by the disc diffusion method against cephalothin and cefuroxime. The activity of the two drugs was comparable to S aureus and S epidermidis, and a little in favour of cefuroxime regarding S faecalis. Cefuroxime turned out to be superior to cephalothin against the gram negative rods investigated. This pattern was most pronounced when Enterobacter was investigated.
TI  - Quantitative assessment of bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics by  agar plate method.
AB  - Quantitative bactericidal activities of beta-lactam antibiotics were determined by the agar plate method. Broth cultures, of which the colony-forming units were counted before the study, were inoculated on antibiotic-containing agar plates, utilizing a 10(-3), 10(-2), or 10(-1) dilution or undiluted culture plated with each 0.001-ml calibrated loop. These plates were incubated at 37 degrees C overnight, and the minimal drug concentration at which no bacterial growth was observed on the plates was defined as minimal inhibitory concentration. After this procedure, the agar surface was treated with beta-lactamase spray to inactivate the antibiotic. These plates were incubated again at 37 degrees C overnight. The minimal drug concentration at which no evidence of bacterial growth was visible on the plates (resulting in a 100% kill) was defined as minimal bactericidal concentration. The lowest concentration which reduced the number of colony-forming units to 1/1,000 that in the original inoculum (resulting in a 99.9% kill) was defined as minimal lethal concentration. When compared for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus (non-enterococcal), beta-hemolytic streptococcus, and enterococcus, the minimal bactericidal concentrations were generally several fold higher than the minimal inhibitory concentrations. Minimal lethal concentrations were virtually the same as minimal inhibitory concentrations for gram-negative strains; however, for some gram-positive strains, minimal lethal concentrations were higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity in vitro of cefaclor, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cefaclor, a new orally administered cephalosporin derivative, was studied in vitro against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinical isolates. Both penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to cefaclor, with mean MICs of 1.44 and 0.93 microgram/ml, respectively. However, the MBC for penicillin-resistant S. aureus was higher than that for the penicillin-susceptible strains. All strains of Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, and Streptococcus pneumoniae tested were highly susceptible to cefaclor; all strains of Streptococcus faecalis were highly resistant to cefaclor. Strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Hemophilus influenzae were susceptible to cefaclor. Eighty per cent of strains of H. influenzae were inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml of cefaclor. Most strains of Enterobacter sp., indole-positive Proteus, Pseudomonas sp., and Serratia sp. were resistant to cefaclor.
TI  - Colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  - A study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. Groups of germfree AKR mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: Streptococcus faecalis. Lactobacillus brevis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and Torulopsis sp. All species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. Later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of E. coli or P. aeruginosa. The presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. Escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. Evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the colonization of P. aeruginosa and not of E. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.
TI  - [Behavior of some microorganisms cultivated in the presence of irradiated maize starch].
AB  - The bactericidal effect of water soluble radiolysis products of Maize starch on Escherichia coli cultures declines when the initial population grows. This toxicity varies with the culture environment and the bacterial species: Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus faecalis, Enterobacter sp. Moreover, for the eucaryote cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae, wild strain or muting "small colonies", only the generating time is altered by the active parts of radiolysis products. The results are analysed with regard to the hypothesis that the hydrogen peroxide is responsible for this toxicity.
TI  - Bacteriological evaluation of fosfomycin in clinical studies.
AB  - Since fosfomycin has behaved in vitro as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, an attempt  has been made to evaluate this behaviour in controlled clinical study carried out at different Spanish hospitals. A total of 959 patients were treated for some of the following infectious clinical processes: gonococcal urethritis, typhoid fever, enterocolitis, acute and chronic urinary tract infections, osteomyelitis, chronic otorrhoea, septicaemia, meningitis, peritonitis, surgical and suppurative infections, bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngoamygdalitis, burns, endometritis, ocular infection, whooping cough and nasal carriers of S. aureus. The results obtained as a function of the microorganism isolated in these clinical processes in percentage of clinical and bacteriological success have been 96% of the S. aureus infections, 95% of the Streptococcus sp. including S. pneumoniae, 90% of the N. gonorrhoeae infections, 94% of the E. coli infections including enteropathogenic E. coli, 90% of the S. marcescens infections, 76% of the Proteus sp. infections, 72% of the Klebsiella-Enterobacter infections, 66% of P. aeruginosa infections and 78% of the S. typhi infections.
TI  - Infection and mortality in captive wild-trapped canvasback ducks.
AB  - Fungal, bacterial and malarial infections, as well as malnutrition caused heavy mortality in a group of wild-trapped canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria) held in 10 X 3 X 2 m open-water pens. Deaths occurred between 21 and 158 days after confinement and were associated with infections of Aspergillus fumigatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Plasmodium sp. Infection and mortality was believed to result from reduced resistance associated with confinement. Fourteen canvasbacks released onto large ponds survived throughout the period during which the penned birds died.
TI  - [Kinetics of setting up of a human fecal flora in germ free mice and trial of decontamination of antibiotherapy (author's transl)].
AB  - We have tried in this study to reproduce in germfree mice a bacterial equilibrium observed previously in the gastrointestinal tract of child "L.N.", reared in a plastic isolator. Eight bacterial strains were studied. Seven had been fortuitously introduced: Acinetobacter lwoffi LN1, Staphylococcus epidermidis LN2, Clostridium perfringens LN3, Plectridium anatum LN4, Streptococcus bovis LN5, Enterobacter cloacae LN6, Corynebacterium sp LN7. The eighth strain was purposely administered to the child in order to take advantage of an antagonism between this strain and spontaneously acquired flora. This strain is Bacillus licheniformis FD1. The gnotoxenic mice proved to be a good experimental model because we found their bacterial equilibrium comparable to that observed in child L.N. In addition, we studied the decontamination procedures of the gastrointestinal tract of mice by observing both the antagonism of B. licheniformis with bacitracin, and the action of a suitable mixture of antibiotics. Conditions for the realization of this decontamination are discussed in this study.
TI  - Formation of methyl mercury by bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-three Hg2+-resistant cultures were isolated from sediment of the Savannah  River in Georgia; of these, 14 were gram-negative short rods belonging to the genera Escherichia and Enterobacter, six were gram-positive cocci (three Staphylococcus sp. and three Streptococcus sp.) and three were Bacillus sp. All the Escherichia, Enterobacter, and the Bacillus strain were more resistant to Hg2+ than the strains of staphylococci and streptococci. Adaptation using serial dilutions and concentration gradient agar plate techniques showed that it was possible to select a Hg2+-resistant strain from a parent culture identified as Enterobacter aerogenes. This culture resisted 1,200 mug of Hg2+ per ml of medium and produced methyl mercury from HgCl2, but was unable to convert Hg2+ to volatile elemental mercury (Hg0). Under constant aeration (i.e., submerged culture), slightly more methyl mercury was formed than in the absence of aeration. Production of methyl mercury was cyclic in nature and slightly decreased if DL-homocysteine was present in media, but increased with methylcobalamine. It is concluded that the bacterial production of methyl mercury may be a means of resistance and detoxification against mercurials in which inorganic Hg2+ is converted to organic form and secreted into the environment.
TI  - Microbiological properties of a new cephalosporin, BL-S 339: 7-(phenylacetimidoyl-aminoacetamido)-3-(2-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-5-ylthiomethyl) ceph-3-em-4-carboxylic acid.
AB  - BL-S 339 is a new broad-spectrum, parenterally effective cephalosporin whose expression of antibacterial activity in vitro is markedly affected by the nature of the assay medium. When assayed in nutrient agar, BL-S 339 was more active than cephalothin against strains of Diplococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and indole-positive Proteus sp. However, when assayed in Mueller-Hinton medium, its activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria, was reduced substantially, whereas the activity of cephalothin was virtually unaffected by the assay medium. The in vivo activity of BL-S 339 correlated well with its activity in nutrient agar; when administered subcutaneously to mice, it was therapeutically more efficacious than cephalothin in infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. When BL-S 339 was administered intramuscularly to mice, the concentrations achieved in the blood were three times those achieved with cephalothin. BL-S 339 was bound to human serum proteins to the same extent as cephalothin. Recovery of BL-S 339 in the urine within the 24-hr period after intramuscular administration to rats was three times that of cephalothin.
TI  - Enhancing effect on alkalinization of the medium on the activity of erythromycin  against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of erythromycin was markedly enhanced by alkalinization of the culture medium or urine within the clinical range (pH 6.0 to 8.2). This effect was demonstrated against recent isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. The urine of normal volunteers was made alkaline by ingestion of sodium bicarbonate or acetazolamide (Diamox) during administration of 1.0 g of erythromycin every 8 hr; such urine was capable of inhibiting E. coli and K. pneumoniae even when diluted up to (in one instance) 128 times with broth of the same pH as the urine. Undiluted urine of the same subjects, without alkalinization, was seldom capable of inhibiting these organisms. The range of pH (6.6 to 8.6) over which the antibacterial effect was enhanced coincided with that over which there was decreasing ionization of a basic group.
