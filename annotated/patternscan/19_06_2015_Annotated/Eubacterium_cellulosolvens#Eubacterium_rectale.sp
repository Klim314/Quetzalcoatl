TI  == 16s rdna analysis of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens: phylogenetic position and relation to butyrate-producing anaerobic bacteria from the rumen of white-tailed  deer.
AB  == complete 16s rdna sequences of six strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, including the type strain (atcc 19171), were determined. the type strain was found to have less than 89% sequence similarity to the other isolates that were examined. the five plasmid-bearing strains formed a closely related cluster and three of these strains (ob156, ob157 and ob192) were very highly related (> 99%), indicating that they are isolates of the same genomic species. the phylogenetic position of butyrivibrio was found to be within the subphylum clostridium, of gram-positive bacteria. the closest relatives to the type strain were eubacterium cellulosolvens and cl. xylanolyticum and the closest relatives to the separately  clustered strains were roseburia ceciola, lachnospira pectinoschiza and eubacterium rectale.
