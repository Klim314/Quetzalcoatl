TI  - Comparison of bacterial culture and 16S rRNA community profiling by clonal analysis and pyrosequencing for the characterization of the dentine caries-associated microbiome.
AB  - Culture-independent analyses have greatly expanded knowledge regarding the composition of complex bacterial communities including those associated with oral diseases. A consistent finding from such studies, however, has been the under-reporting of members of the phylum Actinobacteria. In this study, five pairs of broad range primers targeting 16S rRNA genes were used in clonal analysis of 6 samples collected from tooth lesions involving dentine in subjects with active caries. Samples were also subjected to cultural analysis and pyrosequencing by means of the 454 platform. A diverse bacterial community of 229 species-level taxa was revealed by culture and clonal analysis, dominated by representatives of the genera Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Selenomonas, and Streptococcus. The five most abundant species were: Lactobacillus gasseri, Prevotella denticola, Alloprevotella tannerae, S. mutans and Streptococcus sp. HOT 070, which together made up 31.6 % of the sequences. Two samples were dominated by lactobacilli, while the remaining samples had low numbers of lactobacilli but significantly higher numbers of Prevotella species. The different primer pairs produced broadly similar data but proportions of the phylum Bacteroidetes were significantly higher when primer 1387R was used. All of the primer sets underestimated the proportion of Actinobacteria compared to culture. Pyrosequencing analysis of the samples was performed to a depth of sequencing of 4293 sequences per sample which were identified to 264 species-level taxa, and resulted in significantly higher coverage estimates than the clonal analysis. Pyrosequencing, however, also underestimated the relative abundance of Actinobacteria compared to culture.
TI  - An investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  - Different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the pulp chambers (PCs) and root canals (RCs) of infected primary teeth using PCR methods. Paired PC and RC samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by PCR for the presence of Filifactor alocis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella tannerae, Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Treponema socranskii. The frequency of each species was determined in the PC and RC of each case. The species most frequently detected in PCs were P. nigrescens (86.7%), P. gingivalis (73.3%), and F. alocis (73.3%). Of the PC samples, 13.3% contained P. micra and T. denticola, and 6.7% contained T. forsythia. The species most frequently detected in RCs were P. gingivalis (100%) and P. nigrescens (93.3%). P. tannerae, P. micra, and T. denticola were found in 40% of the RC samples; T. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the RC samples. The "red complex", which comprises P. gingivalis, T. denticola, and T. forsythia, was not found in the PC of any tooth but was found in 30% of the RC samples. The detection of P. nigrescens in the PC was statistically associated with the presence of P. nigrescens in the RC (p = 0.04). The results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.
TI  - PCR methodology as a valuable tool for identification of endodontic pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews the principles of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  methodology, its application in identification of endodontic pathogens and the perspectives regarding the knowledge to be reached with the use of this highly sensitive, specific and accurate methodology as a microbial identification test. DATA SOURCES: Studies published in the medical, dental and biological literature. STUDY SELECTION: Evaluation of published epidemiological studies examining the endodontic microbiota through PCR methodology. CONCLUSIONS: PCR technology has enabled the detection of bacterial species that are difficult or even impossible to culture as well as cultivable bacterial strains showing a phenotypically divergent or convergent behaviour. Moreover, PCR is more rapid, much more sensitive, and more accurate when compared with culture. Its use in endodontics to investigate the microbiota associated with infected root canals has expanded the knowledge on the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases. For instance, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), Treponema denticola, other Treponema species, Dialister pneumosintes, and Prevotella tannerae were detected in infected root canals for the first time and in high prevalence when using PCR analysis. The diversity of endodontic microbiota has been demonstrated by studies using PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the PCR products. Moreover, other fastidious bacterial species, such as Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis and some Eubacterium spp., have been reported in endodontic infections at a higher prevalence than those reported by culture procedures.
