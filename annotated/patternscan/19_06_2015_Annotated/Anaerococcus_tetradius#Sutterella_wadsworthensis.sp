TI  == taxonomy--general comments and update on taxonomy of clostridia and anaerobic cocci.
AB  == since such things as sites of normal carriage, type and severity of infections produced, and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns may vary according to the particular species involved, accurate taxonomy for differentiation of species is  important. for example, reclassification of the 'bacteroides gracilis group' revealed that sutterella wadsworthensis is actually responsible for the antimicrobial resistance seen in that group. with clostridia and anaerobic cocci, as with other taxa, there have been a number of recent changes in classification  of existing taxa as well as description of novel taxa. it is important that both  clinicians and microbiologists adapt quickly to new classification schemes and new taxa as soon as they are validated. for example, peptostreptococcus is now restricted to the species p. anaerobius and five new genera have been created. there has also been significant reclassification of clostridia and new species of clostridia have also been described.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == in vitro activities of mk-826 (l-749,345) against 363 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of mk-826 was compared to the activities of cefoxitin, ceftriaxone,  imipenem, and meropenem against 363 gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes by  using nccls procedures. at least 98% of the strains were susceptible to the carbapenems. all strains of clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus, and sutterella wadsworthensis were susceptible to all agents  tested.

TI  == recently described clinically important anaerobic bacteria: taxonomic aspects and update.
AB  == a new method of identifying bacteria, phylogenetic 16s rrna sequencing, has led to major reorganizations among most genera of anaerobic bacteria. the pigmented prevotella species now comprise seven species including p. nigrescens and p. tannerae; p. intermedia/p. nigrescens-like organisms await inclusion. the former  mitsuokella dentalis and hallella seregens were transferred to prevotella as one  species, p. dentalis. p. enoeca is a new nonpigmenting prevotella. the genus porphyromonas currently includes 11 pigmented species and one nonpigmented species, p. catoniae; p. levii-like and p. endodontalis-like organisms are candidates for the genus. fusobacterium nucleatum currently has five subspecies,  and f. varium includes the former f. pseudonecrophorum. former wolinella recta and wolinella curva now are campylobacter rectus and campylobacter curvus; campylobacter showae is a new species. isolates included in the bile-sensitive former bacteroides gracilis now are campylobacter gracilis; the bile-resistant b. gracilis isolates were transferred to a new genus, sutterella, as s. wadsworthensis. the new actinomyces species include two subspecies of the a. neuii and the a. radingae-a. turicensis complex. the genus eubacterium sensu stricto is represented by e. limosum, and the former e. alactolyticum was reclassified in a new genus, pseudoramibacter, as p. alactolyticus. recent entries include e. saphenum, e. minutum, e. exiguum, e. infirmum, and e. tardum.  a new genus, atopobium houses some former lactobacilli and streptococci. the genus peptostreptococcus also have four new species; p. hydrogenalis, p. lacrimalis, p. lactolyticus, and p. vaginalis.

TI  == in vitro activities of trovafloxacin against 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of trovafloxacin for 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth agar dilution technique. the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (n = 91), other members of the b. fragilis group (n = 130),  campylobacter gracilis (n = 15), other bacteroides spp. (n = 16), prevotella spp. (n = 49), porphyromonas spp. (n = 15), fusobacterium spp. (n = 62), bilophila wadsworthia (n = 24), sutterella wadsworthensis (n = 21), clostridium spp. (n = 61), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 38), and gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (n = 35). trovafloxacin inhibited all strains of b. fragilis at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, 99% of other b. fragilis group species at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, and 96% of all anaerobes tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml.
