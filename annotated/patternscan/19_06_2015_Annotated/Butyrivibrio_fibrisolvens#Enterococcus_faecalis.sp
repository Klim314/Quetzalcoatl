TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == development of a dna probe for streptococcus bovis by using a cloned amylase gene.
AB  == streptococcus bovis is a normal inhabitant of the rumen but has been implicated as a causative agent for ruminal lactic acidosis and related problems. while rarely isolated from humans, s. bovis has been identified as a causative agent for endocarditis, meningitis, and septicemia. recent reports have also suggested  a correlation between human colonic carcinoma and increased levels of s. bovis. identification of s. bovis strains of human origin has been problematic because of variations in results of biochemical tests compared with results for ruminal strains. we have tested a cloned amylase gene from the ruminal strain s. bovis jb1 as a potential dna probe for rapid and accurate identification of s. bovis strains from all sources. dnas from strains identified as s. bovis, of both human and ruminal origin, were found to hybridize with the probe under stringent conditions. the probe also hybridized with variants of s. bovis that did not grow on starch. the probe did not hybridize with dna isolated from other bacteria of human colonic and ruminal origin, including bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ruminicola, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and enterococcus faecalis but  did demonstrate hybridization with streptococcus salivarius.

TI  == introduction of tn916 and pam beta 1 into streptococcus bovis jb1 by conjugation.
AB  == the transposon tn916 and self-mobilizing plasmid pam beta 1 were conjugated from  enterococcus faecalis to the ruminal bacterium streptococcus bovis jb1. transconjugants were identified by resistance to tetracycline (tn916) or erythromycin (pam beta 1) and by southern hybridization analyses. transfer frequencies were 7.0 x 10(-6) and 1.0 x 10(-6) per recipient cell for tn916 and pam beta 1, respectively. the transconjugants jb1/tn916 and jb1/pam beta 1 were used as donors for matings with e. faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and the ruminal bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. while pam beta 1 was successfully transferred to all three organisms, tn916 was transferred only into b. subtilis and b. fibrisolvens at very low frequencies. this is the first report of conjugal dna transfers between two ruminal organisms.

TI  == conjugal transfer of tn916, tn916 delta e, and pam beta 1 from enterococcus faecalis to butyrivibrio fibrisolvens strains.
AB  == anaerobic filter matings of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c, cf3, d1, or gs113, representing different dna relatedness groups, were done with enterococcus faecalis cg110, which contains chromosomally inserted tn916. tetracycline-resistant transconjugants were obtained with each mating pair at average frequencies of 4.4 x 10(-6) (per recipient) and 5.2 x 10(-6) (per donor). the transfer frequencies of tn916 into b. fibrisolvens varied 5- to 10-fold with  mating time, strain, and growth stage. by using southern hybridization with pam120 as the probe, tn916 was shown to insert at one or more separate chromosomal sites for each strain of b. fibrisolvens. retransfer of tn916 from b. fibrisolvens h17c or cf3 to e. faecalis og1-x or jh 2-2 or to b. fibrisolvens d1  or gs113 could not be shown. matings of e. faecalis rh110, which contains chromosomally inserted tn916 delta e, with b. fibrisolvens 49, h17c, d1, cf3, gs113, or vv-1 resulted in erythromycin-resistant transconjugants at average frequencies of 5.3 x 10(-7) (per recipient) and 2.5 x 10(-7) (per donor). tn916 delta e was shown by southern hybridization with pam120 to insert at one or more  sites in the chromosome of each strain. b. fibrisolvens h17c was anaerobically filter mated with e. faecalis jh 2-ss, which contains pam beta 1. erythromycin-resistant transconjugants were obtained at frequencies of 2 x 10(-5) (per recipient) and 6 x 10(-5) (per donor). the presence of pam beta 1 in these transconjugants could not be shown by agarose gel electrophoresis of plasmid minilysates but could be shown by southern hybridization analysis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the biohydrogenation of alpha-linolenic acid and oleic acid by rumen micro-organisms.
AB  == 1. alpha-[u-(14)c]linolenic acid was incubated with the rumen contents of sheep and the metabolic products were characterized by thin-layer chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography and absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and infrared. 2. a tentative scheme for the biohydrogenation route to stearic acid is presented. the main pathway is through diconjugated cis-cis-cis-octadecatrienoic  acid, non-conjugated trans-cis (cis-trans)-octadecadienoic acid and trans-octadecenoic acid, but other pathways are apparent. 3. washed rumen micro-organisms possessed only a limited capacity to hydrogenate alpha-linolenic  acid and oleic acid but the rate was greatly stimulated by a factor(s) present in the supernatant rumen liquor. 4. pure cultures of clostridium perfringens, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli and a coliform organism isolated from sheep faeces possessed negligible ability to hydrogenate unsaturated fatty acids  compared with a mixed population of rumen micro-organisms. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens slowly converted linoleic acid into octadecenoic acid.
