TI  == acid production and growth by oral lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  == aim: to analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral lactobacillus species. methods: thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of lactobacillus, representing nine species, including lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de man, rogosa,  and sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (ph 7.0). acid production and growth were  measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. results: lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species.  they also produced more acid than the others. lactobacillus vaginalis showed the  lowest rate of growth and acid production. these findings demonstrated that the different species of lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. conclusion: there was variation in acid production and growth between the lactobacillus species. the strongest acid producers were lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. it seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.

TI  == inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  == aims: to determine the inhibitory effect of oral lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. methods and results: total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral lactobacillus, lactobacillus fermentum (195), lactobacillus salivarius (53), lactobacillus casei (20), lactobacillus gasseri (18), lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), lactobacillus paracasei (12), lactobacillus mucosae (12), lactobacillus oris (12), lactobacillus plantarum (11) and lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. most oral lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. the strongest inhibitory activity was associated with lact. paracasei, lact. plantarum, lact. rhamnosus, lact. casei and lact. salivarius. lactobacillus sd1-sd6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 in the biofilm model. also, it was demonstrated that growth of strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with lact. paracasei sd1. the inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. conclusions: the results have shown that oral lactobacillus sd1-sd6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against strep. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, gram-negative periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. significance  and impact of the study: the results indicated that lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.

TI  == susceptibility to some antifungal drugs of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from healthy women.
AB  == samples were taken from the lateral vaginal wall of 19 healthy women. lactobacilli were isolated from ten of these women. fifty-eight lactobacillus isolates were identified as l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. acidophilus, l. delbrueckii spp. lactis, l. crispatus, l. plantarum, l. cellobiosus, l. jensenii, l. salivarius, l. curvatus, l. brevis and l. oris. the inhibitory effect of isoconazole and oxiconazole in 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 microg/ml concentrations on 58 lactobacillus spp. and candida albicans (ajd 180) were investigated, using an agar diffusion method. although both antifungal drugs showed a large inhibitory effect on c. albicans, oxiconazole had a very low inhibitory effect on lactobacillus isolates. the natural resistance of lactobacilli to anti-fungal drugs may enable the development of an antifungal drug(s)/ probiotic combination  for antifungal activity and lactobacilli replacement therapy.

TI  == lactobacillus frumenti sp. nov., a new lactic acid bacterium isolated from rye-bran fermentations with a long fermentation period.
AB  == within the framework of the characterization of the microflora of an industrial sourdough fermentation, strains of lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus pontis and two other strains were isolated which could not be associated with a valid species. these latter strains were gram-positive, catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods that could be clearly differentiated from known species by 16s rdna sequence analysis. for further characterization, the morphological, physiological (sugar fermentation, formation of dl-lactate, hydrolysis of arginine, growth temperature, co2 production) and chemotaxonomic (g+c content, cell wall composition, sds-page of whole-cell proteins) properties  were determined. fitting of the complete 16s rdna sequence into alignments of such sequences, together with the subsequent phylogenetic calculations, allowed the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. these data showed that the two strains were phylogenetically related but formed an independent cluster distinct from their closest neighbours, l. pontis, lactobacillus panis, lactobacillus oris, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus reuteri. the results of dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated that the two isolates represent a new lactobacillus species, for which the name lactobacillus frumenti is proposed; the type strain of this species is dsm 13145t (= lmg 19473t).

TI  == multiplex pcr for the detection of lactobacillus pontis and two related species in a sourdough fermentation.
AB  == a specific multiplex pcr assay based on the amplification of parts of the 16s rrna molecule was designed. primers derived from variable regions of the 16s rrna provided a means of easily differentiating the species lactobacillus pontis and lactobacillus panis. they could be clearly discriminated from the phylogenetically related species lactobacillus vaginalis, lactobacillus oris, and lactobacillus reuteri and from other lactobacilli commonly known to be present in sourdough. other strains isolated together with l. pontis from an industrial sourdough fermentation could be clearly separated from these species by comparative sequence analysis and construction of a specific pcr primer. for a fast identification a dna isolation protocol based on the ultrasonic lysis of cells from single colonies was developed. to demonstrate the potential of such techniques for tracking these organisms in a laboratory-scale fermentation, we combined the specific pcr assay with direct dna extraction from the organisms in  the sourdough without previous cultivation.

TI  == the identification of vaginal lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal dna probes to 20 american type culture collection lactobacillus strains. most women were colonized by l. crispatus (32%), followed by l. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated l. 1086v (15%), l. gasseri (5%), l. fermentum (0.3%), l. oris (0.3%), l. reuteri  (0.3%), l. ruminis (0.3%), and l. vaginalis (0.3%). h2o2 was produced by 95% of l. crispatus and 94% of l. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of l. 1086v.  colonization by l. crispatus or l. jensenii was positively associated with being  white (p<.001), age >/=20 years (p=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (p=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (p<.001) and gonorrhea (p=.03). l. crispatus and l. jensenii, not l. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.

TI  == lactobacillus panis sp. nov., from sourdough with a long fermentation period.
AB  == two lactobacillus strains isolated from rye sourdough most closely resemble lactobacillus oris on the basis of their physiological, morphological, and chemotaxonomic characteristics. a 16s ribosomal dna sequence analysis showed that these two strains clustered with, but were separate from, l. oris, lactobacillus  vaginalis, and lactobacillus pontis. the results of dna-dna hybridization experiments indicated that the new two isolates represent a new lactobacillus species, for which we propose the name lactobacillus panis; strain dsm 6035t is the type strain of this species.
