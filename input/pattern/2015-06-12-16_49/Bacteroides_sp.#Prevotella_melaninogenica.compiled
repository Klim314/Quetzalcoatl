TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - Oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  - CONTEXT: The oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. OBJECTIVE: To compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. PATIENTS: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. SETTING: Santa Casa de Sao Paulo Emergency Service. DESIGN: A blind prospective study. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. RESULTS: The study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: Bacteroides sp, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium sp, Veilonella sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, Propionibacterium sp, Bifidobacterium sp and Clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. Candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). Enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. Infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (RTH), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (OTH). Mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). The highest recovery rate of organisms per tonsil was in patients with OTH (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in RT and 5.9 per tonsil in RTH. The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), Neisseria sp (16), Staphylococcus aureus (14), and Eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Fusobacterium sp (8), Bacteroides sp (7), and Prevotella melaninogenica (5). The number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). A higher concentration of S aureus and H influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (RTH and OTH) as compared to RT. These findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for H influenzae and S aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and without inflammation (RTH and OTH). Further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - Pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of Bacteroides fragilis and  B. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate Bacteroides fragilis strains and Escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of the B. melaninogenicus group and Streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. Single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. Single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (S. pyogenes, E. coli or Bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. However, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. Combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. Non-capsulate Bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either S. pyogenes or E. coli. Therapy directed at the elimination of S. pyogenes and E. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate Bacteroides spp. These data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the B. fragilis group and E. coli and between the B. melaninogenicus group and S. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.
TI  - Experimentally induced subcutaneous infection by black pigmented Bacteroides species in rats.
AB  - In a rat model of anaerobic subcutaneous abscess developed to study the pathogenicity of pure cultures of black pigmented Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides intermedius) maximum lesions were seen between 7 and 15 days after inoculation. Abscesses were produced by one type strain each of B. melaninogenicus and B. intermedius and by 20 of 25 clinical isolates of black pigmented Bacteroides species.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - Production of phenylacetic acid by strains of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Bacteroides gingivalis (sp. nov.).
AB  - Strains of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Bacteroides melaninogenicus subspecies isolated from human and animal sources were examined for the production of phenylacetic acid. B. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from sites in humans and monkeys always produced phenylacetic acid. B. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from human nonoral sites consistently failed to produce this product. This metabolic difference correlates with the genetic dichotomy recently found to exist between oral and nonoral B. asaccharolyticus strains.
TI  - [Phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. A complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom : Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces sp., Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a Gram- bacteria related to group II j. The pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. This kind of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
