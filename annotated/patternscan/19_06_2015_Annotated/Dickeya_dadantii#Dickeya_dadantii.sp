TI  == slya regulates mota and motb, virulence and stress-related genes under conditions induced by the phop-phoq system in dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == we previously showed that slya of dickeya dadantii 3937 plays an important role in virulence toward plants, and that the deltaslya mutant is hypermotile, whereas flagellum synthesis and flagellin production are indistinguishable from the wild  type. here we show that motility factors, including the distance of continuous directed movement, time for that movement and speed, were significantly higher in the deltaslya mutant than in the wild type. remarkably, transcription levels of mota and motb, that are involved in flagellar rotation, were elevated in the deltaslya mutant, suggesting that the mutant's hypermotility was due to an increase in flagellar rotation. in low (10 mum) magnesium medium that activates the phop-phoq system, growth and virulence of the deltaslya mutant were much lower than for the wild type; expression of mota, motb, mgta, pela, pelb, pelc, peld, pele, peli, inda, tolc, sodc, acsa and hrpn were also reduced in the mutant. interestingly, mota, motb, peld, pele, peli, sodc and inda were also reduced in phop and phoq mutants. because the slya protein directly binds to the  promoter region of phop, slya regulates virulence by controlling multiple pathogenicity-related genes directly and/or at least by controlling phop in d. dadantii 3937 when magnesium is low.

TI  == chromosomal "stress-response" domains govern the spatiotemporal expression of the bacterial virulence program.
AB  == recent studies strongly suggest that the gene expression sustaining both normal and pathogenic bacterial growth is governed by the structural dynamics of the chromosome. however, the mechanistic device coordinating the chromosomal configuration with selective expression of the adaptive traits remains largely unknown. we used a holistic approach exploring the inherent relationships between the physicochemical properties of the dna and the expression of adaptive traits,  including virulence factors, in the pathogen dickeya dadantii (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi). in the transcriptomes obtained under adverse conditions encountered during bacterial infection, we explored the patterns of chromosomal dna sequence organization, supercoil dynamics, and gene expression densities, together with the long-range regulatory impacts of the abundant dna architectural proteins implicated in pathogenicity control. by integrating these data, we identified transient chromosomal domains of coherent gene expression featuring distinct couplings between dna thermodynamic stability, supercoil dynamics, and virulence traits. importance: we infer that the organization of transient chromosomal domains serving specific functions acts as a fundamental device for versatile adjustment of the pathogen to environmental stress. we believe that the identification of chromosomal "stress-response" domains harboring distinct virulence traits and mediating the cellular adaptive behavior provides a breakthrough in understanding the control mechanisms of bacterial pathogenicity.

TI  == the two-component system cpxar is essential for virulence in the phytopathogen bacteria dickeya dadantii ec3937.
AB  == the cpxar two-component system is present in many proteobacteria. it controls expression of genes required to maintain envelope integrity in response to environmental injury. consequently, this two-component system was shown to be required for virulence of several zoo-pathogens, but it has never been investigated in phyto-pathogens. in this paper, we investigate the role of the cpxar two-component system in vitro and in vivo in dickeya dadantii, an enterobacterial phytopathogen that causes soft-rot disease in a large variety of  plant species. cpxa null mutant displays a constitutively phosphorylated cpxr phenotype as shown by direct analysis of phosphorylation of cpxr by a phos-tag retardation gel approach. virulence in plants is completely abolished in cpxa or  cpxr mutants of d. dadantii. in planta, cpxar is only activated at an early stage of the infection process as shown by phos-tag and gene fusion analyses. to our knowledge, this is the first time that the timing of cpxar phosphorelay activation has been investigated during the infection process by direct monitoring of response regulator phosphorylation.

TI  == a straightforward and reliable method for bacterial in planta transcriptomics: application to the dickeya dadantii/arabidopsis thaliana pathosystem.
AB  == transcriptome analysis of bacterial pathogens is a powerful approach to identify  and study the expression patterns of genes during host infection. however, analysis of the early stages of bacterial virulence at the genome scale is lacking with respect to understanding of plant-pathogen interactions and diseases, especially during foliar infection. this is mainly due to both the low  ratio of bacterial cells to plant material at the beginning of infection, and the high contamination by chloroplastic material. here we describe a reliable and straightforward method for bacterial cell purification from infected leaf tissues, effective even if only a small amount of bacteria is present relative to plant material. the efficiency of this method for transcriptomic analysis was validated by analysing the expression profiles of the phytopathogenic enterobacterium dickeya dadantii, a soft rot disease-causing agent, during the first hours of infection of the model host plant arabidopsis thaliana. transcriptome profiles of epiphytic bacteria and bacteria colonizing host tissues were compared, allowing identification of approximately 100 differentially expressed genes. requiring no specific equipment, cost-friendly and easily transferable to other pathosystems, this method should be of great interest for many other plant-bacteria interaction studies.

TI  == new cyt-like delta-endotoxins from dickeya dadantii: structure and aphicidal activity.
AB  == in the track of new biopesticides, four genes namely cyta, cytb, cytc and cytd encoding proteins homologous to bacillus thuringiensis (bt) cyt toxins have been  identified in the plant pathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii genome. here we show that three cyt-like delta-endotoxins from d. dadantii (cyta, cytb and cytc) are toxic to the pathogen of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum in terms of both mortality and growth rate. the phylogenetic analysis of the comprehensive set of  cyt toxins available in genomic databases shows that the whole family is of limited taxonomic occurrence, though in quite diverse microbial taxa. from a structure-function perspective the 3d structure of cytc and its backbone dynamics in solution have been determined by nmr. cytc adopts a cytolysin fold, structurally classified as a cyt2-like protein. moreover, the identification of a putative lipid binding pocket in cytc structure, which has been probably maintained in most members of the cyt-toxin family, could support the importance  of this lipid binding cavity for the mechanism of action of the whole family. this integrative approach provided significant insights into the evolutionary and functional history of d. dadantii cyt toxins, which appears to be interesting leads for biopesticides.

TI  == bacterial pectate lyases, structural and functional diversity.
AB  == pectate lyases are enzymes involved in plant cell wall degradation. they cleave pectin using a beta-elimination mechanism, specific for acidic polysaccharides. they are mainly produced by plant pathogens and plant-associated organisms, and only rarely by animals. pectate lyases are also commonly produced in the bacterial world, either by bacteria living in close proximity with plants or by gut bacteria that find plant material in the digestive tract of their hosts. the  role of pectate lyases is essential for plant pathogens, such as dickeya dadantii, that use a set of pectate lyases as their main virulence factor. symbiotic bacteria produce their own pectate lyases, but they also induce plant pectate lyases to initiate the symbiosis. pectin degradation products may act as  signals affecting the plant-bacteria interactions. bacterial pectate lyases are also essential for using the pectin of dead or living plants as a carbon source for growth. in the animal gut, bacteroides pectate lyases degrade the pectin of ingested food, and this is particularly important for herbivores that depend on their microflora for the digestion of pectin. some human pathogens, such as yersinia enterocolitica, produce a few intracellular pectate lyases that can facilitate their growth in the presence of highly pectinolytic bacteria, at the plant surface, in the soil or in the animal gut.

TI  == systemic infection generates a local-like immune response of the bacteriome organ in insect symbiosis.
AB  == endosymbiosis is common in insects thriving in nutritionally unbalanced habitats. the cereal weevil, sitophilus oryzae, houses sodalis pierantonius, a gram-negative intracellular symbiotic bacterium (endosymbiont), within a dedicated organ called a bacteriome. recent data have shown that the bacteriome expresses certain immune genes that result in local symbiont tolerance and control. here, we address the question of whether and how the bacteriome responds to insect infections involving exogenous bacteria. we have established an infection model by challenging weevil larvae with the gram-negative bacterium dickeya dadantii. we showed that d. dadantii infects host tissues and triggers a  systemic immune response. gene transcript analysis indicated that the bacteriome  is also immune responsive, but it expresses immune effector genes to a lesser extent than the systemic and intestinal responses. most genes putatively involved in immune pathways remain weakly expressed in the bacteriome following d. dadantii infection. moreover, quantitative pcr experiments showed that the endosymbiont load is not affected by insect infection or the resulting bacteriome immune activation. thus, the contained immune effector gene expression in the bacteriome may prevent potentially harmful effects of the immune response on endosymbionts, whilst efficiently protecting them from bacterial intruders.

TI  == role of dickeya dadantii 3937 chemoreceptors in the entry to arabidopsis leaves through wounds.
AB  == chemotaxis enables bacteria to move towards an optimal environment in response to chemical signals. in the case of plant-pathogenic bacteria, chemotaxis allows pathogens to explore the plant surface for potential entry sites with the ultimate aim to prosper inside plant tissues and to cause disease. chemoreceptors, which constitute the sensory core of the chemotaxis system, are usually transmembrane proteins which change their conformation when sensing chemicals in the periplasm and transduce the signal through a kinase pathway to the flagellar motor. in the particular case of the soft-rot pathogen dickeya dadantii 3937, jasmonic acid released in a plant wound has been found to be a strong chemoattractant which drives pathogen entry into the plant apoplast. in order to identify candidate chemoreceptors sensing wound-derived plant compounds, we carried out a bioinformatics search of candidate chemoreceptors in the genome  of dickeya dadantii 3937. the study of the chemotactic response to several compounds and the analysis of the entry process to arabidopsis leaves of 10 selected mutants in chemoreceptors allowed us to determine the implications of at least two of them (abf-0020167 and abf-0046680) in the chemotaxis-driven entry process through plant wounds. our data suggest that abf-0020167 and abf-0046680 may be candidate receptors of jasmonic acid and xylose, respectively.

TI  == the role for tola in enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli pathogenesis and virulence gene transcription.
AB  == loss of the periplasm spanning protein tola in escherichia coli leads to activation of the rcs phosphorelay, and is required for full virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica and dickeya dadantii. this study explores the role for tola in the pathogenesis of enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) and the effect of its mutation on the transcription of key ehec virulence  genes controlled by rcs phosphorelay, including the type iii secretion system (t3ss) (espa and tir), the e. coli common pilus (ecpa), and motility (flic). promoter activity for t3ss regulator ler was substantially higher following inactivation of tola, and corresponded with a similar elevation in espa and tir transcription. likewise, ecpa transcription was increased in ehecdeltatola. conversely, and in-line with previous studies, inactivation of tola resulted in complete loss of motility and decreased flic transcription. for all genes examined, altered transcription observed for ehecdeltatola was dependent on the outer-membrane lipoprotein rcsf. despite elevated virulence gene transcription, in tola deleted strains virulence of ehec in the galleria mellonella wax worm model was substantially attenuated in a manner at least partly dependent on rcsf, and adherence to cultured ht-29 colonic epithelial cells was markedly reduced. the results of this study broaden the role for tola in ehec pathogenesis, and suggest that significant outer-membrane perturbations are able to promote transcription of important ehec adherence factors.

TI  == increased phosphorylation of the rcsb regulator of the rcscdb phosphorelay in strains of dickeya dadantii devoid of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans revealed  by phos-tag gel analysis.
AB  == osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs) are general constituents of many proteobacteria. opgs are important factors required for full virulence in many pathogens including dickeya dadantii. d. dadantii causes the soft-rot disease in  a wide range of plant species. the pleiotropic phenotype of opg-negative strains  includes total loss of virulence and motility, and is linked to the constitutive  activation of the rcscdb phosphorelay, deduced from expression analysis of genes  of the rcscdb regulon. the constitutive activation of the rcscdb phosphorelay in  an opg-negative strain was demonstrated by direct analysis of the phosphorylation level of the rcsb regulator protein in vivo by using a phos-tag retardation gel approach, and was correlated with the phenotype and the expression of motility genes. data revealed a low level of rcsb phosphorylated form in the wild-type strain and a slight increase of phosphorylation in opgg mutant strains sufficient to induce the pleiotropic phenotype observed.

TI  == alterations of iron distribution in arabidopsis tissues infected by dickeya dadantii.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a plant-pathogenic enterobacterium responsible for plant soft rot disease in a wide range of hosts, including the model plant arabidopsis thaliana. iron distribution in infected a. thaliana was investigated at the cellular scale using the perls'-diaminobenzidine-h2 o2 (pdh) method. iron visualization during infection reveals a loss of iron from cellular compartments  and plant cell walls. during symptom progression, two distinct zones are clearly  visible: a macerated zone displaying weak iron content and a healthy zone displaying strong iron content. immunolabelling of cell wall methylated pectin shows that pectin degradation is correlated with iron release from cell walls, indicating a strong relationship between cell wall integrity and iron in plant tissues. using a d. dadantii lipopolysaccharide antibody, we show that bacteria are restricted to the infected tissue, and that they accumulate iron in planta. in conclusion, weak iron content is strictly correlated with bacterial cell localization in the infected tissues, indicating a crucial role of this element during the interaction. this is the first report of iron localization at the cellular level during a plant-microbe interaction and shows that pdh is a method  of choice in this type of investigation.

TI  == deciphering the components that coordinately regulate virulence factors of the soft rot pathogen dickeya dadantii.
AB  == the bacterial soft rot pathogen dickeya dadantii utilizes the type iii secretion  system (t3ss) to suppress host defense responses, and secretes pectate lyase (pel) to disintegrate the plant cell wall. a transposon mutagenesis fluorescence-activated cell sorting screen was used to identify mutants with altered promoter activities of the t3ss pilus gene hrpa. several insertion mutations, resulting in changes in hrpa expression, were mapped to a new locus, opggh, which encodes the gene cluster responsible for osmoregulated periplasmic glucan (opg) synthesis proteins. our data showed that opg was involved in t3ss and pel regulation by altering the expression of the regulatory small rna rsmb. through genome searching, the mechanism of two novel regulatory components, the rcscd-rcsb phosphorelay and csrd on opg and the rsmb gene, was further investigated. the rcs phosphorelay and opg inversely regulated rsmb at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, respectively. csrd exhibited dual functionality in t3ss and pel regulation by manipulating levels of rsmb rna  and cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-gmp). csrd positively regulated the promoter activity of the rsmb gene but negatively controlled rsmb rna at the post-transcriptional level via opggh. in addition, csrd contains both ggdef and eal domains but acted as a c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase. when the expression of the csrd gene was induced, csrd regulated t3ss expression and pel production through  controlling intracellular c-di-gmp levels.

TI  == substrate recognition by the bacterial type ii secretion system: more than a simple interaction.
AB  == type ii secretion system (t2ss) is a multiprotein trans-envelope complex that translocates fully folded proteins through the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. although t2ss is extensively studied in several bacteria pathogenic for humans, animals and plants, the molecular basis for exoprotein recruitment by this secretion machine as well as the underlying targeting motifs remain unknown. to address this question, we used bacterial two-hybrid, surface plasmon resonance, in vivo site-specific photo-cross-linking approaches and functional analyses. we showed that the fibronectin-like fn3 domain of exoprotein peli from  dickeya dadantii interacts with four periplasmic domains of the t2ss components gspd and gspc. the interaction between exoprotein and the gspc pdz domain is positively modulated by the gspd n1 domain, suggesting that exoprotein secretion  is driven by a succession of synergistic interactions. we found that an exposed 9-residue-long loop region of peli interacts with the gspc pdz domain. this loop  acts as a specific secretion signal that controls exoprotein recruitment by the t2ss. concerted in silico and in vivo approaches reveal the occurrence of equivalent secretion motifs in other exoproteins, suggesting a plausible general  mechanism of exoprotein recruitment by the t2ss.

TI  == derivative of plant phenolic compound inhibits the type iii secretion system of dickeya dadantii via hrpx/hrpy two-component signal transduction and rsm systems.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (t3ss) is a major virulence factor in many gram-negative bacterial pathogens and represents a particularly appealing target  for antimicrobial agents. previous studies have shown that the plant phenolic compound p-coumaric acid (pca) plays a role in the inhibition of t3ss expression  of the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937. this study screened a series of derivatives of plant phenolic compounds and identified that trans-4-hydroxycinnamohydroxamic acid (ts103) has an eight-fold higher inhibitory potency than pca on the t3ss of d. dadantii. the effect of ts103 on regulatory components of the t3ss was further elucidated. our results suggest that ts103 inhibits hrpy phosphorylation and leads to reduced levels of hrps and hrpl transcripts. in addition, through a reduction in the rna levels of the regulatory small rna rsmb, ts103 also inhibits hrpl at the post-transcriptional level via the rsmb-rsma regulatory pathway. finally, ts103 inhibits hrpl transcription and  mrna stability, which leads to reduced expression of hrpl regulon genes, such as  hrpa and hrpn. to our knowledge, this is the first inhibitor to affect the t3ss through both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional pathways in the soft-rot phytopathogen d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == identification of host-microbe interaction factors in the genomes of soft rot-associated pathogens dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium carotovorum wpp14 with supervised machine learning.
AB  == background: a wealth of genome sequences has provided thousands of genes of unknown function, but identification of functions for the large numbers of hypothetical genes in phytopathogens remains a challenge that impacts all research on plant-microbe interactions. decades of research on the molecular basis of pathogenesis focused on a limited number of factors associated with long-known host-microbe interaction systems, providing limited direction into this challenge. computational approaches to identify virulence genes often rely on two strategies: searching for sequence similarity to known host-microbe interaction factors from other organisms, and identifying islands of genes that discriminate between pathogens of one type and closely related non-pathogens or pathogens of a different type. the former is limited to known genes, excluding vast collections of genes of unknown function found in every genome. the latter lacks specificity, since many genes in genomic islands have little to do with host-interaction. result: in this study, we developed a supervised machine learning approach that was designed to recognize patterns from large and disparate data types, in order to identify candidate host-microbe interaction factors. the soft rot enterobacteriaceae strains dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium carotovorum wpp14 were used for development of this tool, because  these pathogens are important on multiple high value crops in agriculture worldwide and more genomic and functional data is available for the enterobacteriaceae than any other microbial family. our approach achieved greater than 90% precision and a recall rate over 80% in 10-fold cross validation tests.  conclusion: application of the learning scheme to the complete genome of these two organisms generated a list of roughly 200 candidates, many of which were previously not implicated in plant-microbe interaction and many of which are of completely unknown function. these lists provide new targets for experimental validation and further characterization, and our approach presents a promising pattern-learning scheme that can be generalized to create a resource to study host-microbe interactions in other bacterial phytopathogens.

TI  == structure of the oligogalacturonate-specific kdgm porin.
AB  == the phytopathogenic gram-negative bacterium dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi) feeds on plant cell walls by secreting pectinases and utilizing the oligogalacturanate products. an outer membrane porin, kdgm, is indispensable for  the uptake of these acidic oligosaccharides. here, the crystal structure of kdgm  determined to 1.9 a resolution is presented. kdgm is folded into a regular 12-stranded antiparallel beta-barrel with a circular cross-section defining a transmembrane pore with a minimal radius of 3.1 a. most of the loops that would face the cell exterior in vivo are disordered, but nevertheless mediate contact between densely packed membrane-like layers in the crystal. the channel is lined  by two tracks of arginine residues facing each other across the pore, a feature that is conserved within the kdgm family and is likely to facilitate the diffusion of acidic oligosaccharides.

TI  == production of cecropin a antimicrobial peptide in rice seed endosperm.
AB  == background: cecropin a is a natural antimicrobial peptide that exhibits rapid, potent and long-lasting lytic activity against a broad spectrum of pathogens, thus having great biotechnological potential. here, we report a system for producing bioactive cecropin a in rice seeds. results: transgenic rice plants expressing a codon-optimized synthetic cecropin a gene drived by an endosperm-specific promoter, either the glutelin b1 or glutelin b4 promoter, were generated. the signal peptide sequence from either the glutelin b1 or the glutelin b4 were n-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the cecropin a. we  also studied whether the presence of the kdel endoplasmic reticulum retention signal at the c-terminal has an effect on cecropin a subcellular localization and accumulation. the transgenic rice plants showed stable transgene integration and  inheritance. we show that cecropin a accumulates in protein storage bodies in the rice endosperm, particularly in type ii protein bodies, supporting that the glutelin n-terminal signal peptides play a crucial role in directing the cecropin a to this organelle, independently of being tagged with the kdel endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. the production of cecropin a in transgenic rice seeds did not affect seed viability or seedling growth. furthermore, transgenic cecropin a seeds exhibited resistance to infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens (fusarium verticillioides and dickeya dadantii, respectively) indicating that the in planta-produced cecropin a is biologically active. conclusions: rice seeds can sustain bioactive cecropin a production and accumulation in protein bodies. the system might benefit the production of this antimicrobial agent for subsequent applications in crop protection and food preservation.

TI  == genomic and metabolic comparison with dickeya dadantii 3937 reveals the emerging  dickeya solani potato pathogen to display distinctive metabolic activities and t5ss/t6ss-related toxin repertoire.
AB  == background: the pectinolytic enterobacteria of the pectobacterium and dickeya genera are causative agents of maceration-associated diseases affecting a wide variety of crops and ornamentals. for the past decade, the emergence of a novel species d. solani was observed in potato fields in europe and the mediterranean basin. the purpose of this study is to search by comparative genomics the genetic traits that could be distinctive to other dickeya species and be involved in d. solani adaptation to the potato plant host. results: d. solani 3337 exhibits a 4.9 mb circular genome that is characterized by a low content in mobile elements  with the identification of only two full length insertion sequences. a genomic comparison with the deeply-annotated model d. dadantii 3937 strain was performed. while a large majority of dickeya virulence genes are shared by both strains, a few hundreds genes of d. solani 3337, mostly regrouped in 25 genomic regions, are distinctive to d. dadantii 3937. these genomic regions are present in the other available draft genomes of d. solani strains and interestingly some of them were  not found in the sequenced genomes of the other dickeya species. these genomic regions regroup metabolic genes and are often accompanied by genes involved in transport systems. a metabolic analysis correlated some metabolic genes with distinctive functional traits of both d. solani 3337 and d. dadantii 3937. three  identified d. solani genomic regions also regroup nrps/pks encoding genes. in addition, d. solani encodes a distinctive arsenal of t5ss and t6ss-related toxin-antitoxin systems. these genes may contribute to bacteria-bacteria interactions and to the fitness of d. solani to the plant environment. conclusions: this study highlights the genomic specific traits of the emerging pathogen d. solani and will provide the basis for studying those that are involved in the successful adaptation of this emerging pathogen to the potato plant host.

TI  == regulators involved in dickeya solani virulence, genetic conservation, and functional variability.
AB  == bacteria from the genus dickeya (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) are plant pathogens causing severe diseases in many economically important crops. a majority of the strains responsible for potato disease in europe belong to a newly identified dickeya solani species. although some ecological and epidemiological studies have been carried out, little is known about the regulation of d. solani virulence. the characterization of four d. solani strains indicates significant differences in their virulence on potato, although they are genetically similar based on genomic fingerprinting profiles. a phenotypic examination included an analysis of virulence on potato; growth rate in culture;  motility; fe3+ chelation; and pectate lyase, cellulase, protease, biosurfactant,  and blue pigment production. mutants of four d. solani strains were constructed by inactivating the genes coding either for one of the main negative regulators of d. dadantii virulence (kdgr, pecs, and pect) or for the synthesis and perception of signaling molecules (expi and expr). analysis of these mutants indicated that pecs, pect, and kdgr play a similar role in both species, repressing, to different degrees, the synthesis of virulence factors. the thermoregulator pect seems to be a major regulator of d. solani virulence. this work also reveals the role of quorum sensing mediated by expi and expr in d. solani virulence on potato.

TI  == inactivation of pecs restores the virulence of mutants devoid of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans in the phytopathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a phytopathogenic enterobacterium that causes soft rot disease in a wide range of plant species. maceration, an apparent symptom of the  disease, is the result of the synthesis and secretion of a set of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (pcwdes), but many additional factors are required for full virulence. among these, osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs) and the pecs transcriptional regulator are essential virulence factors. several cellular  functions are controlled by both opgs and pecs. strains devoid of opgs display a  pleiotropic phenotype including total loss of virulence, loss of motility and severe reduction in the synthesis of pcwdes. pecs is one of the major regulators  of virulence in d. dadantii, acting mainly as a repressor of various cellular functions including virulence, motility and synthesis of pcwdes. the present study shows that inactivation of the pecs gene restored virulence in a d. dadantii strain devoid of opgs, indicating that pecs cannot be de-repressed in strains devoid of opgs.

TI  == scavenging iron: a novel mechanism of plant immunity activation by microbial siderophores.
AB  == siderophores are specific ferric iron chelators synthesized by virtually all microorganisms in response to iron deficiency. we have previously shown that they promote infection by the phytopathogenic enterobacteria dickeya dadantii and erwinia amylovora. siderophores also have the ability to activate plant immunity. we have used complete arabidopsis transcriptome microarrays to investigate the global transcriptional modifications in roots and leaves of arabidopsis (arabidopsis thaliana) plants after leaf treatment with the siderophore deferrioxamine (dfo). physiological relevance of these transcriptional modifications was validated experimentally. immunity and heavy-metal homeostasis  were the major processes affected by dfo. these two physiological responses could be activated by a synthetic iron chelator ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic) acid, indicating that siderophores eliciting activities rely on their strong iron-chelating capacity. dfo was able to protect arabidopsis against the pathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000. siderophore treatment caused local modifications of iron distribution in leaf cells visible by ferrocyanide and diaminobenzidine-h(2)o(2)  staining. metal quantifications showed that dfo causes a transient iron and zinc  uptake at the root level, which is presumably mediated by the metal transporter iron regulated transporter1 (irt1). defense gene expression and callose deposition in response to dfo were compromised in an irt1 mutant. consistently, plant susceptibility to d. dadantii was increased in the irt1 mutant. our work shows that iron scavenging is a unique mechanism of immunity activation in plants. it highlights the strong relationship between heavy-metal homeostasis and immunity.

TI  == bacterial virulence and fis: adapting regulatory networks to the host environment.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria have to cope with adverse conditions, such as the host environment and host defense reactions. to adapt quickly to environmental changes, pathogens have developed complex regulatory networks that ensure adequate expression of their virulence genes. recent evidence suggests that fis,  an abundant nucleoid-associated protein transiently produced during early exponential growth, plays a major role in these networks in several pathogenic bacteria. this review focuses on two enterobacteria, salmonella enterica and dickeya dadantii, that inhabit distinct ecological niches to illustrate how fis uses different strategies to coordinate virulence gene expression, depending on the bacterial lifestyle.

TI  == jasmonate-dependent modifications of the pectin matrix during potato development  function as a defense mechanism targeted by dickeya dadantii virulence factors.
AB  == the plant cell wall constitutes an essential protection barrier against pathogen  attack. in addition, cell-wall disruption leads to accumulation of jasmonates (jas), which are key signaling molecules for activation of plant inducible defense responses. however, whether jas in return modulate the cell-wall composition to reinforce this defensive barrier remains unknown. the enzyme 13-allene oxide synthase (13-aos) catalyzes the first committed step towards biosynthesis of jas. in potato (solanum tuberosum), there are two putative st13-aos genes, which we show here to be differentially induced upon wounding. we also determine that both genes complement an arabidopsis aos null mutant, indicating that they encode functional 13-aos enzymes. indeed, transgenic potato  plants lacking both st13-aos genes (coaos1/2 lines) exhibited a significant reduction of jas, a concomitant decrease in wound-responsive gene activation, and an increased severity of soft rot disease symptoms caused by dickeya dadantii. intriguingly, a hypovirulent d. dadantii pel strain lacking the five major pectate lyases, which causes limited tissue maceration on wild-type plants, regained infectivity in coaos1/2 plants. in line with this, we found differences  in pectin methyl esterase activity and cell-wall pectin composition between wild-type and coaos1/2 plants. importantly, wild-type plants had pectins with a lower degree of methyl esterification, which are the substrates of the pectate lyases mutated in the pel strain. these results suggest that, during development  of potato plants, jas mediate modification of the pectin matrix to form a defensive barrier that is counteracted by pectinolytic virulence factors from d.  dadantii.

AB  == pectinolytic bacteria have been recently isolated from diseased potato plants exhibiting blackleg and slow wilt symptoms found in a number of european countries and israel. these gram-reaction-negative, motile, rods were identified  as belonging to the genus dickeya, previously the pectobacterium chrysanthemi complex (erwinia chrysanthemi), on the basis of production of a pcr product with  the pelade primers, 16s rrna gene sequence analysis, fatty acid methyl esterase analysis, the production of phosphatases and the ability to produce indole and acids from alpha-methylglucoside. differential physiological assays used previously to differentiate between strains of e. chrysanthemi, showed that these isolates belonged to biovar 3. eight of the isolates, seven from potato and one from hyacinth, were analysed together with 21 reference strains representing all  currently recognized taxa within the genus dickeya. the novel isolates formed a distinct genetic clade in multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa) using concatenated  sequences of the intergenic spacer (igs), as well as dnax, reca, dnan, fusa, gapa, pura, rplb, rpos and gyra. characterization by whole-cell maldi-tof mass spectrometry, pulsed field gel electrophoresis after digestion of whole-genome dna with rare-cutting restriction enzymes, average nucleotide identity analysis and dna-dna hybridization studies, showed that although related to dickeya dadantii, these isolates represent a novel species within the genus dickeya, for  which the name dickeya solani sp. nov. (type strain ipo 2222(t) = lmg25993(t) = ncppb4479(t)) is proposed.

TI  == dynamic interplay between the periplasmic and transmembrane domains of gspl and gspm in the type ii secretion system.
AB  == the type ii secretion system (t2ss) is a multiprotein nanomachine that transports folded proteins across the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. the molecular mechanisms that govern the secretion process remain poorly understood.  the inner membrane components gspc, gspl and gspm possess a single transmembrane  segment (tms) and a large periplasmic region and they are thought to form a platform of unknown function. here, using two-hybrid and pull-down assays we performed a systematic mapping of the gspc/gspl/gspm interaction regions in the plant pathogen dickeya dadantii. we found that the tms of these components interact with each other, implying a complex interaction network within the inner membrane. we also showed that the periplasmic, ferredoxin-like, domains of gspl and gspm drive homo- and heterodimerizations of these proteins. disulfide bonding analyses revealed that the respective domain interfaces include the equivalent secondary-structure elements, suggesting alternating interactions of the periplasmic domains, l/l and m/m versus l/m. finally, we found that displacements of the periplasmic gspm domain mediate coordinated shifts or rotations of the cognate tms. these data suggest a plausible mechanism for signal transmission between the periplasmic and the cytoplasmic portions of the t2ss machine.

TI  == metabolic engineering of escherichia coli for biosynthesis of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) from glucose.
AB  == the escherichia coli xl1-blue strain was metabolically engineered to synthesize poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) [p(3hb-co-3hv)] through 2-ketobutyrate, which is generated via citramalate pathway, as a precursor for propionyl-coa. two different metabolic pathways were examined for the synthesis of propionyl-coa from 2-ketobutyrate. the first pathway is composed of the dickeya dadantii 3937 2-ketobutyrate oxidase or the e. coli pyruvate oxidase mutant (poxb l253f v380a) for the conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionate and the ralstonia eutropha propionyl-coa synthetase (prpe) or the e. coli acetyl-coa:acetoacetyl-coa transferase for further conversion of propionate into  propionyl-coa. the second pathway employs pyruvate formate lyase encoded by the e. coli tdce gene or the clostridium difficile pflb gene for the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa. as the direct conversion of 2-ketobutyrate into propionyl-coa could not support the efficient production of p(3hb-co-3hv) from glucose, the first metabolic pathway was further examined. when the recombinant e. coli xl1-blue strain equipped with citramalate pathway expressing the e. coli poxb l253f v380a gene and r. eutropha prpe gene together with the r. eutropha pha biosynthesis genes was cultured in a chemically defined  medium containing 20 g/l of glucose as a sole carbon source, p(3hb-co-2.3 mol% 3hv) was produced up to the polymer content of 61.7 wt.%. moreover, the 3hv monomer fraction in p(3hb-co-3hv) could be increased up to 5.5 mol% by additional deletion of the prpc and scpc genes, which are responsible for the metabolism of  propionyl-coa in host strains.

TI  == phylogeny and classification of dickeya based on multilocus sequence analysis.
AB  == bacterial heart rot of pineapple reported in hawaii in 2003 and reoccurring in 2006 was caused by an undetermined species of dickeya. classification of the bacterial strains isolated from infected pineapple to one of the recognized dickeya species and their phylogenetic relationships with dickeya were determined by a multilocus sequence analysis (mlsa), based on the partial gene sequences of  dnaa, dnaj, dnax, gyrb and recn. individual and concatenated gene phylogenies revealed that the strains form a clade with reference dickeya sp. isolated from pineapple in malaysia and are closely related to d. zeae; however, previous dna-dna reassociation values suggest that these strains do not meet the genomic threshold for consideration in d. zeae, and require further taxonomic analysis. an analysis of the markers used in this mlsa determined that recn was the best overall marker for resolution of species within dickeya. differential intraspecies resolution was observed with the other markers, suggesting that marker selection is important for defining relationships within a clade. phylogenies produced with gene sequences from the sequenced genomes of strains d. dadantii ech586, d. dadantii ech703 and d. zeae ech1591 did not place the sequenced strains with members of other well-characterized members of their respective species. the average nucleotide identity (ani) and tetranucleotide frequencies determined for the sequenced strains corroborated the results of the  mlsa that d. dadantii ech586 and d. dadantii ech703 should be reclassified as dickeya zeae ech586 and dickeya paradisiaca ech703, respectively, whereas d. zeae ech1591 should be reclassified as dickeya chrysanthemi ech1591.

TI  == a family 3 glycosyl hydrolase of dickeya dadantii 3937 is involved in the cleavage of aromatic glucosides.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a phytopathogenic bacterium secreting a large array of plant-cell-wall-degrading enzymes that participate in the infection and maceration of the host plant tissue. sequencing of the d. dadantii 3937 genome predicted several genes encoding potential glycosidases. one of these genes, bgxa, encodes a protein classified in family 3 of glycosyl hydrolases. inactivation of bgxa and the use of a gene fusion revealed that this gene is not  essential for d. dadantii pathogenicity but that it is expressed during plant infection. the bgxa expression is induced in the presence of glycosidic or non-glycosidic aromatic compounds, notably ferulic acid, cinnamic acid, vanillic  acid and salicin. the bgxa enzyme has a principal beta-d-glucopyranosidase activity and a secondary beta-d-xylopyranosidase activity (ratio 70 : 1). this enzyme activity is inhibited by different aromatic glycosides or phenolic compounds, in particular salicin, arbutin, ferulic acid and vanillic acid. together, the induction effects and the enzyme inhibition suggest that bgxa is mostly involved in the cleavage of aromatic beta-glucosides. there is evidence of functional redundancy in the d. dadantii beta-glucoside assimilation pathway. in  contrast to other beta-glucoside assimilation systems, involving cytoplasmic phospho-beta-glucosidases, the cleavage of aromatic glucosides in the periplasmic space by bgxa may avoid the release of a toxic phenolic aglycone into the cytoplasm while still allowing for catabolism of the glucose moiety.

TI  == streptomyces coelicolor encodes a urate-responsive transcriptional regulator with homology to pecs from plant pathogens.
AB  == many transcriptional regulators control gene activity by responding to specific ligands. members of the multiple-antibiotic resistance regulator (marr) family of transcriptional regulators feature prominently in this regard, and they frequently function as repressors in the absence of their cognate ligands. plant  pathogens such as dickeya dadantii encode a marr homolog named pecs that controls expression of a gene encoding the efflux pump pecm in addition to other virulence genes. we report here that the soil bacterium streptomyces coelicolor also encodes a pecs homolog (sco2647) that regulates a pecm gene (sco2646). s. coelicolor pecs, which exists as a homodimer, binds the intergenic region between pecs and pecm genes with high affinity. several potential pecs binding sites were found in this intergenic region. the binding of pecs to its target dna can be efficiently attenuated by the ligand urate, which also quenches the intrinsic fluorescence of pecs, indicating a direct interaction between urate and pecs. in  vivo measurement of gene expression showed that activity of pecs and pecm genes is significantly elevated after exposure of s. coelicolor cultures to urate. these results indicate that s. coelicolor pecs responds to the ligand urate by attenuated dna binding in vitro and upregulation of gene activity in vivo. since  production of urate is associated with generation of reactive oxygen species by xanthine dehydrogenase, we propose that pecs functions under conditions of oxidative stress.

TI  == anatomy of secretin binding to the dickeya dadantii type ii secretion system pilotin.
AB  == the secretins are a family of large multimeric channels in the outer membrane of  gram-negative bacteria that are involved in protein export. in dickeya dadantii and many other pathogenic bacteria, the lipoprotein pilotin targets the secretin  subunits to the outer membrane, allowing a functional type ii secretion system to be assembled. here, the crystal structure of the c-terminal peptide of the secretin subunit bound to its cognate pilotin is reported. in solution, this c-terminal region of the secretin is nonstructured. the secretin peptide folds on binding to the pilotin to form just under four turns of alpha-helix which bind tightly up against the first helix of the pilotin so that the hydrophobic residues of the secretin helix can bind to the hydrophobic surface of the pilotin. the secretin helix binds parallel to the first part of the fourth helix  of the pilotin. an n-capping aspartate encourages helix formation and binding by  interacting favourably with the helix dipole of the helical secretin peptide. the structure of the secretin-pilotin complex of the phytopathogenic d. dadantii described here is a paradigm for this interaction in the outs-puls family of pilotins, which is essential for the correct assembly of the type ii secretion system of several potent human adversaries, including enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli and klebsiella oxytoca.

TI  == role of the lysr-type transcriptional regulator pect and dna supercoiling in the  thermoregulation of pel genes, the major virulence factors in dickeya dadantii.
AB  == bacteria are colonizers of various environments and host organisms, and they are  often subjected to drastic temperature variations. dickeya dadantii is a pathogen infecting a wide range of plant species. soft rot, the visible symptom, is mainly due to the production of pectate lyases (pels) that destroy plant cell walls. the production of pels is controlled by a complex regulation system that responds to  various stimuli, such as the presence of pectin, growth phase and temperature. despite numerous regulatory studies, the thermoregulation mechanism of pel production remains unexplained. here, we show that pect, a previously identified  repressor, modulates pel gene expression in a temperature-dependent manner, and we demonstrate that pect binding on pel promoters increases concomitantly with temperature. high temperatures relax the dna in d. dadantii, and remarkably, artificial relaxation of dna at low temperatures increases pect binding to dna. deletion of pect augmented the capacity of d. dadantii to initiate soft-rot symptoms at high temperatures. these results reveal that dna topology and pect act in concert to fine-tune d. dadantii virulence in response to temperature. this novel combination between dna topology and a conventional transcriptional regulator extends our understanding of the thermoregulation mechanisms involved in bacterial virulence.

TI  == combination of capillary isoelectric focusing in a tapered capillary with maldi-tof ms for rapid and reliable identification of dickeya species from plant  samples.
AB  == this study was undertaken to investigate feasibility of a combination of capillary isoelectric focusing (cief) in a tapered fused silica (fs) capillary with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for a rapid and reliable identification of bacteria taken from plant-tissue-containing samples. eight strains representing different species of  the genus dickeya were selected on the basis of close proximity of their isoelectric points: d. chrysanthemi, d. chrysanthemi bv. parthenii, d. chrysanthemi bv. chrysanthemi, d. dadantii, d. paradisiaca, d. solani, d. diffenbachiae, and d. dianthicola. because the dickeya species (spp.) cannot be easily discriminated from each other when cief is performed in a cylindrical fs capillary (commonly used in cief) even if a narrow ph gradient is used, a tapered fs capillary was employed instead, which enabled satisfactory discrimination of the examined bacteria due to enhanced separation efficiency of cief in the tapered fs capillary. cief in the tapered fs capillary was also successfully used for the detection and characterization of dickeya spp. in a plant-tissue-containing sample. then an off-line combination of cief with maldi-tof ms was employed for rapid and reliable identification of dickeya spp. in the plant-tissue-containing sample. it was found that the presence of plant tissue did not affect the results, making the proposed procedure very promising with respect to the fast and reliable detection and identification of bacteria in plant-tissue-containing samples.

TI  == development of a quantitative assay amenable for high-throughput screening to target the type ii secretion system for new treatments against plant-pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == plant-pathogenic bacteria are the causative agents of diseases in important agricultural crops and ornamental plants. the severe economic burden of these diseases requires seeking new approaches for their control, particularly because  phytopathogenic bacteria are often resistant to available treatments. the type ii secretion (t2s) system is a key virulence factor used by major groups of phytopathogenic bacteria. the t2s machinery transports many hydrolytic enzymes responsible for degradation of the plant cell wall, thus enabling successful colonization and dissemination of the bacteria in the plant host. the genetic inactivation of the t2s system leads to loss of virulence, which strongly suggests that targeting the t2s could enable new treatments against plant-pathogenic bacteria. accordingly, we have designed and optimized an assay to identify small-molecule inhibitors of the t2s system. this assay uses a double parametric output: measurement of bacterial growth and the enzymatic activity of  cellulase, which is secreted via the t2s pathway in our model organism dickeya dadantii. the assay was evaluated by screening natural extracts, culture filtrates isolated from rhizosphere bacteria, and a collection of pharmaceutically active compounds in lopac(1280). the calculated z' values of 0.63, 0.63, and 0.58, respectively, strongly suggest that the assay is applicable for a high-throughput screening platform.

TI  == rhs proteins from diverse bacteria mediate intercellular competition.
AB  == rearrangement hotspot (rhs) and related yd-peptide repeat proteins are widely distributed in bacteria and eukaryotes, but their functions are poorly understood. here, we show that gram-negative rhs proteins and the distantly related wall-associated protein a (wapa) from gram-positive bacteria mediate intercellular competition. rhs and wapa carry polymorphic c-terminal toxin domains (rhs-ct/wapa-ct), which are deployed to inhibit the growth of neighboring cells. these systems also encode sequence-diverse immunity proteins (rhsi/wapi) that specifically neutralize cognate toxins to protect rhs(+)/wapa(+) cells from  autoinhibition. rhsa and rhsb from dickeya dadantii 3937 carry nuclease domains that degrade target cell dna. d. dadantii 3937 rhs genes do not encode secretion  signal sequences but are linked to hemolysin-coregulated protein and valine-glycine repeat protein g genes from type vi secretion systems. valine-glycine repeat protein g is required for inhibitor cell function, suggesting that rhs may be exported from d. dadantii 3937 through a type vi secretion mechanism. in contrast, wapa proteins from bacillus subtilis strains appear to be exported through the general secretory pathway and deliver a variety of trnase toxins into neighboring target cells. these findings demonstrate that yd-repeat proteins from phylogenetically diverse bacteria share a common function in contact-dependent growth inhibition.

TI  == peln is a new pectate lyase of dickeya dadantii with unusual characteristics.
AB  == the plant-pathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii produces several pectinolytic enzymes that play a major role in the soft-rot disease. eight characterized endopectate lyases are secreted in the extracellular medium by the type ii secretion system, out. they cleave internal glycosidic bonds of pectin, leading to plant tissue maceration. the d. dadantii pectate lyases belong to different families, namely, pl1, pl2, pl3, and pl9. analysis of the d. dadantii 3937 genome revealed a gene encoding a new protein of the pl9 family, which already includes  the secreted endopectate lyase pell and the periplasmic exopectate lyase pelx. we demonstrated that peln is an additional extracellular protein secreted by the out system. however, peln has some unusual characteristics. although most pectate lyases require a very alkaline ph and ca(2)(+) for their activity, the peln activity is optimal at ph 7.4 and in the presence of fe(2)(+) as a cofactor. peln is only weakly affected by the degree of pectin methyl esterification. the peln structural model, constructed on the basis of the pell structure, suggests that the pell global topology and its catalytic amino acids are conserved in peln. notable differences concern the presence of additional loops at the peln surface, and the replacement of pell charged residues, involved in substrate binding, by aromatic residues in peln. the peln expression is affected by different environmental conditions, such as ph, osmolarity, and temperature. it is controlled by the repressors kdgr and pecs and by the activator gaca, three regulators of d. dadantii pectinase genes. since a peln mutant had reduced virulence on chicory leaves, the peln enzyme plays a role in plant infection, despite its low specific activity and its unusual cofactor requirement.

TI  == delivery of cdia nuclease toxins into target cells during contact-dependent growth inhibition.
AB  == bacterial contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is mediated by the cdib/cdia  family of two-partner secretion proteins. cdi systems deploy a variety of distinct toxins, which are contained within the polymorphic c-terminal region (cdia-ct) of cdia proteins. several cdia-cts are nucleases, suggesting that the toxins are transported into the target cell cytoplasm to interact with their substrates. to analyze cdia transfer to target bacteria, we used the cdi system of uropathogenic escherichia coli 536 (upec536) as a model. antibodies recognizing the amino- and carboxyl-termini of cdia(upec536) were used to visualize transfer of cdia from cdi(upec536+) inhibitor cells to target cells using fluorescence microscopy. the results indicate that the entire cdia(upec536) protein is deposited onto the surface of target bacteria. cdia(upec536) transfer  to bama101 mutants is reduced, consistent with low expression of the cdi receptor bama on these cells. notably, our results indicate that the c-terminal cdia-ct toxin region of cdia(upec536) is translocated into target cells, but the n-terminal region remains at the cell surface based on protease sensitivity. these results suggest that the cdia-ct toxin domain is cleaved from cdia(upec536) prior to translocation. delivery of a heterologous dickeya dadantii cdia-ct toxin, which has dnase activity, was also visualized. following incubation with cdi(+) inhibitor cells targets became anucleate, showing that the d.dadantii cdia-ct was delivered intracellularly. together, these results demonstrate that diverse cdi toxins are efficiently translocated across target cell envelopes.

TI  == transcriptome of dickeya dadantii infecting acyrthosiphon pisum reveals a strong  defense against antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == the plant pathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii has recently been shown to be able to kill the aphid acyrthosiphon pisum. while the factors required to cause plant disease are now well characterized, those required for insect pathogeny remain mostly unknown. to identify these factors, we analyzed the transcriptome of the bacteria isolated from infected aphids. more than 150 genes were upregulated and 300 downregulated more than 5-fold at 3 days post infection. no homologue to known toxin genes could be identified in the upregulated genes. the  upregulated genes reflect the response of the bacteria to the conditions encountered inside aphids. while only a few genes involved in the response to oxidative stress were induced, a strong defense against antimicrobial peptides (amp) was induced. expression of a great number of efflux proteins and transporters was increased. besides the genes involved in lps modification by addition of 4-aminoarabinose (the arnbcadtef operon) and phosphoethanolamine (pmrc, eptb) usually induced in gram negative bacteria in response to amps, dltbac and pbpg genes, which confer gram positive bacteria resistance to amps by  adding alanine to teichoic acids, were also induced. both types of modification confer d. dadantii resistance to the amp polymyxin. a. pisum harbors symbiotic bacteria and it is thought that it has a very limited immune system to maintain these populations and do not synthesize amps. the arnb mutant was less pathogenic to a. pisum, which suggests that, in contrast to what has been supposed, aphids do synthesize amp.

TI  == concentration of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs) modulates the activation level of the rcscd rcsb phosphorelay in the phytopathogen bacteria dickeya dadantii.
AB  == osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs) are general constituents of many proteobacteria. synthesis of these oligosaccharides is repressed by increased osmolarity of the medium. opgs are important factors required for full virulence  in many zoo- or phytopathogens including dickeya dadantii. the phytopathogen enterobacterium d. dadantii causes soft-rot disease on a wide range of plant species. the total loss of virulence of opg-negative strains of d. dadantii is linked to the constitutive activation of the rcscd rcsb phosphorelay highlighting relationship between this phosphorelay and opgs. here we show that opgs control the rcscd rcsb activation in a concentration-dependent manner, are required for proper activation of this phosphorelay by medium osmolarity, and a high concentration of opgs in planta is maintained to achieve the low level of activation of the rcscd rcsb phosphorelay required for full virulence in d. dadantii.

TI  == vfm a new quorum sensing system controls the virulence of dickeya dadantii.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a plant pathogen that secretes cell wall-degrading enzymes (cwde) that are responsible for soft-rot symptoms. virulence genes are expressed  in a concerted manner and culminate when bacterial multiplication slows. we identify a 25 kb vfm cluster required for d. dadantii cwde production and pathogenesis. the vfm cluster encodes proteins displaying similarities both with  enzymes involved in amino acid activation and with enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. these similarities suggest that the vfm genes direct the production of a metabolite. cell-free supernatant from the d. dadantii wild-type strain restores cwde production in vfm mutants. collectively, our results indicate that  vfm genes direct the synthesis of an extracellular signal and constitute a new quorum sensing system. perception of the signal is achieved by the two-component  system vfmh-vfmi, which activates the expression of the vfme gene encoding an arac regulator. vfme then activates both the transcription of the cwde genes and  the expression of the vfm operons. the vfm gene cluster does not seem to be widespread among bacterial species but is conserved in other dickeya species and  could have been laterally transferred to rahnella. this work highlights that entirely new families of bacterial languages remain to be discovered.

TI  == the salmonella transcriptome in lettuce and cilantro soft rot reveals a niche overlap with the animal host intestine.
AB  == fresh vegetables have been recurrently associated with salmonellosis outbreaks, and salmonella contamination of retail produce has been correlated positively with the presence of soft rot disease. we observed that population sizes of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 increased 56-fold when inoculated  alone onto cilantro leaves, versus 2,884-fold when coinoculated with dickeya dadantii, a prevalent pathogen that macerates plant tissue. a similar trend in s. enterica populations was observed for soft-rotted lettuce leaves. transcriptome analysis of s. enterica cells that colonized d. dadantii-infected lettuce and cilantro leaves revealed a clear shift toward anaerobic metabolism and catabolism of substrates that are available due to the degradation of plant cells by the pectinolytic pathogen. twenty-nine percent of the genes that were upregulated in  cilantro macerates were also previously observed to have increased expression levels in the chicken intestine. furthermore, multiple genes induced in soft rot  lesions are also involved in the colonization of mouse, pig, and bovine models of host infection. among those genes, the operons for ethanolamine and propanediol utilization as well as for the synthesis of cobalamin, a cofactor in these pathways, were the most highly upregulated genes in lettuce and cilantro lesions. in s. typhimurium strain lt2, population sizes of mutants deficient in propanediol utilization or cobalamin synthesis were 10- and 3-fold lower, respectively, than those of the wild-type strain in macerated cilantro (p < 0.0002); in strain sl1344, such mutants behaved similarly to the parental strain. anaerobic conditions and the utilization of nutrients in macerated plant tissue that are also present in the animal intestine indicate a niche overlap that may explain the high level of adaptation of s. enterica to soft rot lesions, a common postharvest plant disease.

TI  == sura is involved in the targeting to the outer membrane of a tat signal sequence-anchored protein.
AB  == the twin arginine translocation (tat) pathway exports folded proteins from the cytoplasm to the periplasm of bacteria. the targeting of the exported proteins to the tat pathway relies on a specific amino-terminal signal sequence, which is cleaved after exportation. in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii, the pectin lyase homologue pnlh is exported by the tat pathway without cleavage of its signal sequence, which anchors pnlh into the outer membrane. in proteobacteria, the vast majority of outer membrane proteins consists of beta-barrel proteins and lipoproteins. thus, pnlh represents a new kind of outer membrane protein. in escherichia coli, periplasmic chaperones sura, skp, and degp work together with the beta-barrel assembly machinery (bam) to target and insert beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane. in this work, we showed that sura is required for an efficient targeting of pnlh to the outer membrane. moreover, we were able  to detect an in vitro interaction between sura and the pnlh signal sequence. since the pnlh signal sequence contains a highly hydrophobic region, we propose that sura protects it from the hydrophobic periplasm during targeting of pnlh to  the outer membrane. we also studied the nature of the information carried by the  pnlh signal sequence responsible for its targeting to the outer membrane after exportation by the tat system.

TI  == the nucleoid-associated protein fis directly modulates the synthesis of cellulose, an essential component of pellicle-biofilms in the phytopathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii.
AB  == bacteria use biofilm structures to colonize surfaces and to survive in hostile conditions, and numerous bacteria produce cellulose as a biofilm matrix polymer.  hence, expression of the bcs operon, responsible for cellulose biosynthesis, must be finely regulated in order to allow bacteria to adopt the proper surface-associated behaviours. here we show that in the phytopathogenic bacterium, dickeya dadantii, production of cellulose is required for pellicle-biofilm formation and resistance to chlorine treatments. expression of the bcs operon is growth phase-regulated and is stimulated in biofilms. furthermore, we unexpectedly found that the nucleoid-associated protein and global regulator of virulence functions, fis, directly represses bcs operon expression by interacting with an operator that is absent from the bcs operon of  animal pathogenic bacteria and the plant pathogenic bacterium pectobacterium. moreover, production of cellulose enhances plant surface colonization by d. dadantii. overall, these data suggest that cellulose production and biofilm formation may be important factors for surface colonization by d. dadantii and its subsequent survival in hostile environments. this report also presents a new  example of how bacteria can modulate the action of a global regulator to co-ordinate basic metabolism, virulence and modifications of lifestyle.

TI  == n-acyl homoserine lactones in diverse pectobacterium and dickeya plant pathogens: diversity, abundance, and involvement in virulence.
AB  == soft-rot bacteria pectobacterium and dickeya use n-acyl homoserine lactones (nahsls) as diffusible signals for coordinating quorum sensing communication. the production of nahsls was investigated in a set of reference strains and recently-collected isolates, which belong to six species and share the ability to infect the potato host plant. all the pathogens produced different nahsls, among  which the 3-oxo-hexanoyl- and the 3-oxo-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactones represent  at least 90% of total produced nahsl-amounts. the level of nahsls varied from 0.6 to 2 pg/cfu. the involvement of nahsls in tuber maceration was investigated by electroporating a quorum quenching vector in each of the bacterial pathogen strains. all the nahsl-lactonase expressing strains produced a lower amount of nahsls as compared to those harboring the empty vector. moreover, all except dickeya dadantii 3937 induced a lower level of symptoms in potato tuber assay. noticeably, aggressiveness appeared to be independent of both nature and amount of produced signals. this work highlights that quorum sensing similarly contributed to virulence in most of the tested pectobacterium and dickeya, even the strains had been isolated recently or during the past decades. thus, these key regulatory-molecules appear as credible targets for developing anti-virulence strategies against these plant pathogens.

AB  == worldwide, dickeya (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) is causing soft rot diseases on a large diversity of crops and ornamental plants. strains affecting potato are mainly found in d. dadantii, d. dianthicola and d. zeae, which appear to have a marked geographical distribution. furthermore, a few dickeya isolates from potato are attributed to d. chrysanthemi and d. dieffenbachiae. in europe, isolates of erwinia chrysanthemi biovar 1 and biovar 7 from potato are now classified in d. dianthicola. however, in the past few years, a new dickeya biovar 3 variant, tentatively named 'dickeya solani', has emerged as a common major threat, in particular in seed potatoes. sequences of a flic gene fragment were used to generate a phylogeny of dickeya reference strains from culture collections and with this reference backbone, to classify pectinolytic isolates, i.e. dickeya spp. from potato and ornamental plants. the reference strains of the currently recognized dickeya species and 'd. solani' were unambiguously delineated in the flic phylogram. d. dadantii, d. dianthicola and 'd. solani' displayed unbranched  clades, while d. chrysanthemi, d. zeae and d. dieffenbachiae branched into subclades and lineages. moreover, dickeya isolates from diagnostic samples, in particular biovar 3 isolates from greenhouse ornamentals, formed several new lineages. most of these isolates were positioned between the clade of 'd. solani' and d. dadantii as transition variants. new lineages also appeared in d. dieffenbachiae and in d. zeae. the strains and isolates of d. dianthicola and 'd. solani' were differentiated by a flic sequence useful for barcode identification. a flic taqman(r)real-time pcr was developed for 'd. solani' and the assay was provisionally evaluated in direct analysis of diagnostic potato samples. this molecular tool can support the efforts to control this particular phytopathogen in seed potato certification.

TI  == cysteine scanning mutagenesis and disulfide mapping analysis of arrangement of gspc and gspd protomers within the type 2 secretion system.
AB  == the type ii secretion system (t2ss) secretes enzymes and toxins across the outer  membrane of gram-negative bacteria. the precise assembly of t2ss, which consists  of at least 12 core-components called gsp, remains unclear. the outer membrane secretin, gspd, forms the channels, through which folded proteins are secreted, and interacts with the inner membrane component, gspc. the periplasmic regions of gspc and gspd consist of several structural domains, hr(gspc) and pdz(gspc), and  n0(gspd) to n3(gspd), respectively, and recent structural and functional studies  have proposed several interaction sites between these domains. we used cysteine mutagenesis and disulfide bonding analysis to investigate the organization of gspc and gspd protomers and to map their interaction sites within the secretion machinery of the plant pathogen dickeya dadantii. at least three distinct gspc-gspd interactions were detected, and they involve two sites in hr(gspc), two in n0(gspd), and one in n2(gspd). none of these interactions occurs through static interfaces because the same sites are also involved in self-interactions with equivalent neighboring domains. disulfide self-bonding of critical interaction sites halts secretion, indicating the transient nature of these interactions. the secretion substrate diminishes certain interactions and provokes an important rearrangement of the hr(gspc) structure. the t2ss components oute/l/m affect various interaction sites differently, reinforcing some but diminishing the others, suggesting a possible switching mechanism of these interactions during secretion. disulfide mapping shows that the organization of gspd and gspc subunits within the t2ss could be compatible with a hexamer of dimers arrangement rather than an organization with 12-fold rotational symmetry.

TI  == evolution of the metabolic and regulatory networks associated with oxygen availability in two phytopathogenic enterobacteria.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum are phytopathogenic  enterobacteria capable of facultative anaerobic growth in a wide range of o2 concentrations found in plant and natural environments. the transcriptional response to o2 remains under-explored for these and other phytopathogenic enterobacteria although it has been well characterized for animal-associated genera including escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. knowledge of the extent of conservation of the transcriptional response across orthologous genes in more distantly related species is useful to identify rates and patterns of regulon evolution. evolutionary events such as loss and acquisition of genes by lateral transfer events along each evolutionary branch results in lineage-specific genes, some of which may have been subsequently incorporated into the o2-responsive stimulon. here we present a comparison of transcriptional  profiles measured using densely tiled oligonucleotide arrays for two phytopathogens, dickeya dadantii 3937 and pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043, grown to mid-log phase in mops minimal medium (0.1% glucose) with and without o2. results: more than 7% of the genes of each phytopathogen are differentially expressed with greater than 3-fold changes under anaerobic conditions. in addition to anaerobic metabolism genes, the o2 responsive stimulon includes a variety of virulence and pathogenicity-genes. few of these genes overlap with orthologous genes in the anaerobic stimulon of e. coli. we define these as the conserved core, in which the transcriptional pattern as well as genetic architecture are well preserved. this conserved core includes previously described anaerobic metabolic pathways such as fermentation. other components of  the anaerobic stimulon show variation in genetic content, genome architecture and regulation. notably formate metabolism, nitrate/nitrite metabolism, and fermentative butanediol production, differ between e. coli and the phytopathogens. surprisingly, the overlap of the anaerobic stimulon between the phytopathogens is also relatively small considering that they are closely related, occupy similar niches and employ similar strategies to cause disease. there are cases of interesting divergences in the pattern of transcription of genes between dickeya and pectobacterium for virulence-associated subsystems including the type vi secretion system (t6ss), suggesting that fine-tuning of the stimulon impacts interaction with plants or competing microbes. conclusions: the  small number of genes (an even smaller number if we consider operons) comprising  the conserved core transcriptional response to o2 limitation demonstrates the extent of regulatory divergence prevalent in the enterobacteriaceae. our orthology-driven comparative transcriptomics approach indicates that the adaptive response in the eneterobacteria is a result of interaction of core (regulators) and lineage-specific (structural and regulatory) genes. our subsystems based approach reveals that similar phenotypic outcomes are sometimes achieved by each  organism using different genes and regulatory strategies.

TI  == the toxin/immunity network of burkholderia pseudomallei contact-dependent growth  inhibition (cdi) systems.
AB  == burkholderia pseudomallei is a category b pathogen and the causative agent of melioidosis--a serious infectious disease that is typically acquired directly from environmental reservoirs. nearly all b. pseudomallei strains sequenced to date (> 85 isolates) contain gene clusters that are related to the contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) systems of gamma-proteobacteria. cdi systems from escherichia coli and dickeya dadantii play significant roles in bacterial competition, suggesting these systems may also contribute to the competitive fitness of b. pseudomallei. here, we identify 10 distinct cdi systems in b. pseudomallei based on polymorphisms within the cdia-ct/cdii coding regions, which are predicted to encode cdia-ct/cdii toxin/immunity protein pairs. biochemical analysis of three b. pseudomallei cdia-cts revealed that each protein possesses a distinct trnase activity capable of inhibiting cell growth. these toxin activities are blocked by cognate cdii immunity proteins, which specifically bind the cdia-ct and protect cells from growth inhibition. using burkholderia thailandensis e264 as a model, we show that a cdi system from b. pseudomallei 1026b mediates cdi and is capable of delivering cdia-ct toxins derived from other b. pseudomallei strains. these results demonstrate that burkholderia species contain functional cdi systems, which may confer a competitive advantage to these bacteria.

TI  == iron deficiency affects plant defence responses and confers resistance to dickeya dadantii and botrytis cinerea.
AB  == iron is an essential element for most living organisms, and pathogens are likely  to compete with their hosts for the acquisition of this element. the bacterial plant pathogen dickeya dadantii has been shown to require its siderophore-mediated iron uptake system for systemic disease progression on several host plants, including arabidopsis thaliana. in this study, we investigated the effect of the iron status of arabidopsis on the severity of disease caused by d. dadantii. we showed that symptom severity, bacterial fitness and the expression of bacterial pectate lyase-encoding genes were reduced in iron-deficient plants. reduced symptoms correlated with enhanced expression of the salicylic acid defence plant marker gene pr1. however, levels of the ferritin coding transcript atfer1, callose deposition and production of reactive oxygen species were reduced in iron-deficient infected plants, ruling out the involvement of these defences in the limitation of disease caused by d. dadantii. disease reduction in iron-starved plants was also observed with the necrotrophic  fungus botrytis cinerea. our data demonstrate that the plant nutritional iron status can control the outcome of an infection by acting on both the pathogen's virulence and the host's defence. in addition, iron nutrition strongly affects the disease caused by two soft rot-causing plant pathogens with a large host range. thus, it may be of interest to take into account the plant iron status when there is a need to control disease without compromising crop quality and yield in economically important plant species.

TI  == dickeya dadantii, a plant pathogenic bacterium producing cyt-like entomotoxins, causes septicemia in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum.
AB  == dickeya dadantii (syn. erwinia chrysanthemi) is a plant pathogenic bacteria that  harbours a cluster of four horizontally-transferred, insect-specific toxin genes. it was recently shown to be capable of causing an acute infection in the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum (insecta: hemiptera). the infection route of the pathogen, and the role and in vivo expression pattern of these toxins, remain unknown. using bacterial numeration and immunolocalization, we investigated the kinetics and the pattern of infection of this phytopathogenic bacterium within its insect host. we compared infection by the wild-type strain and by the cyt toxin-deficient mutant. d. dadantii was found to form dense clusters in many luminal parts of the aphid intestinal tract, including the stomach, from which it invaded internal tissues as early as day 1 post-infection. septicemia occurred soon after, with the fat body being the main infected tissue, together with numerous early infections of the embryonic chains showing embryonic gut and fat body as the target organs. generalized septicemia led to insect death when the bacterial load reached about 10(8) cfu. some individual aphids regularly escaped  infection, indicating an effective partial immune response to this bacteria. cyt-defective mutants killed insects more slowly but were capable of localisation in any type of tissue. cyt toxin expression appeared to be restricted to the digestive tract where it probably assisted in crossing over the first cell barrier and, thus, accelerating bacterial diffusion into the aphid haemocel. finally, the presence of bacteria on the surface of leaves hosting infected aphids indicated that the insects could be vectors of the bacteria.

TI  == the nucleoid-associated proteins h-ns and fis modulate the dna supercoiling response of the pel genes, the major virulence factors in the plant pathogen bacterium dickeya dadantii.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a pathogen infecting a wide range of plant species. soft rot, the visible symptom, is mainly due to the production of pectate lyases (pels) that can destroy the plant cell walls. previously we found that the pel gene expression is modulated by h-ns and fis, two nucleoid-associated proteins (naps)  modulating the dna topology. here, we show that relaxation of the dna in growing  d. dadantii cells decreases the expression of pel genes. deletion of fis aggravates, whereas that of hns alleviates the negative impact of dna relaxation  on pel expression. we further show that h-ns and fis directly bind the pele promoter and that the response of d. dadantii pel genes to stresses that induce dna relaxation is modulated, although to different extents, by h-ns and fis. we infer that fis acts as a repressor buffering the negative impact of dna relaxation on pel gene transcription, whereas h-ns fine-tunes the response of virulence genes precluding their expression under suboptimal conditions of supercoiling. this novel dependence of h-ns effect on dna topology expands our understanding of the role of naps in regulating the global bacterial gene expression and bacterial pathogenicity.

TI  == slya regulates type iii secretion system (t3ss) genes in parallel with the t3ss master regulator hrpl in dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (hrp) genes of dickeya dadantii 3937 encode a type iii secretion system (t3ss) which is essential for its full virulence. previous studies of the t3ss regulation in d. dadantii 3937 revealed that the expression of the hrp genes is regulated by a master regulator, hrpl, through the hrpx-hrpy-hrps-hrpl and gacs-gaca-rsmb-rsma pathways. in this work, we identified a novel regulator of the slya/marr family, slya, which regulates hrp genes of the hrpl regulon in parallel with hrpl in d. dadantii. slya regulates the t3ss in a two-tier manner. it negatively regulates the expression of hrpl by downregulating hrps and upregulating rsma. interestingly, concomitant  with its downregulation of the hrpl, slya positively regulates the expression of  hrpa and hrpn, two hrp genes located in the hrpl regulon. in contrast to pectobacterium carotovorum, the expression of slya is not controlled by expr and  expi in d. dadantii 3937. we further show that slya is involved in controlling swimming motility and pellicle formation in d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == genome-wide analysis of the response of dickeya dadantii 3937 to plant antimicrobial peptides.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides constitute an important factor in the defense of plants against pathogens, and bacterial resistance to these peptides have previously been shown to be an important virulence factor in dickeya dadantii, the causal agent of soft-rot disease of vegetables. in order to understand the bacterial response to antimicrobial peptides, a transcriptional microarray analysis was performed upon treatment with sub-lethal concentration of thionins, a widespread  plant peptide. in all, 36 genes were found to be overexpressed, and were classified according to their deduced function as i) transcriptional regulators,  ii) transport, and iii) modification of the bacterial membrane. one gene encoding a uricase was found to be repressed. the majority of these genes are known to be  under the control of the phop/phoq system. five genes representing the different  functions induced were selected for further analysis. the results obtained indicate that the presence of antimicrobial peptides induces a complex response which includes peptide-specific elements and general stress-response elements contributing differentially to the virulence in different hosts.

TI  == role of the dickeya dadantii dps protein.
AB  == during infection, the phytopathogenic enterobacterium dickeya dadantii has to cope with iron-limiting conditions and the production of reactive oxygen species  by plant cells. a tight control of the bacterial intracellular iron content is necessary for full virulence of d. dadantii: previous studies have shown that the ferritin ftna and the bacterioferrtin bfr, devoted to iron storage, contribute differentially to the virulence of this species. in this work, we investigated the role of the dps miniferritin in iron homeostasis in d. dadantii. we constructed a dps-deficient mutant by reverse genetics. this mutant grew like the wild-type stain under iron starvation and showed no decreased iron content. however, the dps mutant displayed an increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide in comparison to the wild-type strain. this hydrogen peroxide susceptibility only occurs when bacteria are in the stationary phase. unlike the bfr and the ftna mutants, the dps mutant is not affected in its pathogenicity on host plants. the  dps gene expression is induced at the stationary phase of growth. the sigma s transcriptional factor is necessary for this control. furthermore, dps expression is positively regulated by the oxidative stress response regulator oxyr during the exponential growth phase, after hydrogen peroxide treatment. these results indicate that the dps miniferritin from d. dadantii has a minor role in iron homeostasis, but is important in conferring tolerance to hydrogen peroxide and for survival of cells that enter the stationary phase of growth.

TI  == cell individuality: the bistable gene expression of the type iii secretion system in dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == dickeya dadantii 3937 is a gram-negative phytopathogenic bacterium that expresses genes encoding a type iii secretion system (t3ss) in a bistable pattern when cultured in a homogeneous minimal media. in this work, we further characterized the bistable gene expression of t3ss at the single-cell level. we demonstrated that bistable expression of the hrpl-regulon genes, such as hrpa and hrpn, is controlled by the same regulatory mechanism. we also showed that the expression level of the t3ss master regulatory gene hrpl plays an important role in the development of the bistable expression of hrpa. a high expression level of hrpl is required but unable to guarantee the high-state expression of hrpa in a cell.  in addition, bistable expression patterns of t3ss genes in other gram-negative pathogens of the enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae families were also described in this study. this suggests that the t3ss bistability might be a conserved population behavior in several gram-negative bacterial pathogens.

TI  == massive production of butanediol during plant infection by phytopathogenic bacteria of the genera dickeya and pectobacterium.
AB  == plant pathogenic bacteria of the genera dickeya and pectobacterium are broad-host-range necrotrophs which cause soft-rot diseases in important crops. a  metabolomic analysis, based on (13)c-nmr spectroscopy, was used to characterize the plant-bacteria interaction. metabolic profiles revealed a decline in plant sugars and amino acids during infection and the concomitant appearance of a compound identified as 2,3-butanediol. butanediol is the major metabolite found in macerated tissues of various host plants. it is accumulated during the symptomatic phase of the disease. different species of dickeya or pectobacterium  secrete high levels of butanediol during plant infection. butanediol has been described as a signalling molecule involved in plant/bacterium interactions and,  notably, able to induce plant systemic resistance. the bud genes, involved in butanediol production, are conserved in the phytopathogenic enterobacteria of the genera dickeya, pectobacterium, erwinia, pantoea and brenneria. inactivation of the bud genes of dickeya dadantii revealed that the virulence of buda, budb and budr mutants was clearly reduced. the genes buda, budb and budc are highly expressed during plant infection. these data highlight the importance of butanediol metabolism in limiting acidification of the plant tissue during the development of the soft-rot disease caused by pectinolytic enterobacteria.

TI  == pecs is an important player in the regulatory network governing the coordinated expression of virulence genes during the interaction between dickeya dadantii 3937 and plants.
AB  == successful infection of a pathogen relies on the coordinated expression of numerous virulence factor-encoding genes. in plant-bacteria interactions, this control is very often achieved through the integration of several regulatory circuits controlling cell-cell communication or sensing environmental conditions. dickeya dadantii (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi), the causal agent of soft rot on many crops and ornamentals, provokes maceration of infected plants mainly by producing and secreting a battery of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. however,  several other virulence factors have also been characterized. during arabidopsis  infection, most d. dadantii virulence gene transcripts accumulated in a coordinated manner during infection. this activation requires a functional gaca-gacs two-component regulatory system but the gac system is not involved in the growth phase dependence of virulence gene expression. here we show that, contrary to pectobacterium, the ahl-mediated expir quorum-sensing system does not play a major role in the growth phase-dependent control of d. dadantii virulence  genes. on the other hand, the global regulator pecs participates in this coordinated expression since, in a pecs mutant, an early activation of virulence  genes is observed both in vitro and in planta. this correlated with the known hypervirulence phenotype of the pecs mutant. analysis of the relationship between the regulatory circuits governed by the pecs and gaca global regulators indicates that these two regulators act independently. pecs prevents a premature expression of virulence genes in the first stages of colonization whereas gaca, presumably in conjunction with other regulators, is required for the activation of virulence genes at the onset of symptom occurrence.

TI  == structural basis for acyl acceptor specificity in the achromobactin biosynthetic  enzyme acsd.
AB  == siderophores are known virulence factors, and their biosynthesis is a target for  new antibacterial agents. a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore biosynthetic pathway in dickeya dadantii is responsible for production of the siderophore achromobactin. the d. dadantii achromobactin biosynthesis protein d (acsd) enzyme has been shown to enantioselectively esterify citric acid with l-serine in the first committed step of achromobactin biosynthesis. the reaction occurs in two steps: stereospecific activation of citric acid by adenylation, followed by attack of the enzyme-bound citryl adenylate by l-serine to produce the homochiral ester. we now report a detailed characterization of the substrate profile and mechanism of the second (acyl transfer) step of acsd enzyme. we demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzes formation of not only esters but also amides from the citryl-adenylate intermediate. we have rationalized the substrate utilization profile for the acylation reaction by determining the first x-ray crystal structure of a product complex for this enzyme class. we have identified the residues that are important for both recognition of l-serine and catalysis of ester formation. our hypotheses were tested by biochemical analysis of various mutants, one of which shows a reversal  of specificity from the wild type with respect to non-natural substrates. this change can be rationalized on the basis of our structural data. that this change  in specificity is accompanied by no loss in activity suggests that acsd and other members of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore superfamily may have biotransformation potential.

TI  == identification of functional toxin/immunity genes linked to contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) and rearrangement hotspot (rhs) systems.
AB  == bacterial contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is mediated by the cdia/cdib  family of two-partner secretion proteins. each cdia protein exhibits a distinct growth inhibition activity, which resides in the polymorphic c-terminal region (cdia-ct). cdi(+) cells also express unique cdii immunity proteins that specifically block the activity of cognate cdia-ct, thereby protecting the cell from autoinhibition. here we show that many cdi systems contain multiple cdia gene fragments that encode cdia-ct sequences. these "orphan" cdia-ct genes are almost always associated with downstream cdii genes to form cdia-ct/cdii modules. comparative genome analyses suggest that cdia-ct/cdii modules are mobile and exchanged between the cdi systems of different bacteria. in many instances, orphan cdia-ct/cdii modules are fused to full-length cdia genes in other bacterial species. examination of cdia-ct/cdii modules from escherichia coli ec93, e. coli ec869, and dickeya dadantii 3937 confirmed that these genes encode  functional toxin/immunity pairs. moreover, the orphan module from ec93 was functional in cell-mediated cdi when fused to the n-terminal portion of the ec93  cdia protein. bioinformatic analyses revealed that the genetic organization of cdi systems shares features with rhs (rearrangement hotspot) loci. rhs proteins also contain polymorphic c-terminal regions (rhs-cts), some of which share significant sequence identity with cdia-cts. all rhs genes are followed by small  orfs representing possible rhsi immunity genes, and several rhs systems encode orphan rhs-ct/rhsi modules. analysis of rhs-ct/rhsi modules from d. dadantii 3937 demonstrated that rhs-cts have growth inhibitory activity, which is specifically  blocked by cognate rhsi immunity proteins. together, these results suggest that rhs plays a role in intercellular competition and that orphan gene modules expand the diversity of toxic activities deployed by both cdi and rhs systems.

TI  == the dickeya dadantii biofilm matrix consists of cellulose nanofibres, and is an emergent property dependent upon the type iii secretion system and the cellulose  synthesis operon.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a plant-pathogenic bacterium that produces cellulose-containing biofilms, called pellicles, at the air-liquid interface of liquid cultures. d. dadantii pellicle formation appears to be an emergent property dependent upon at least three gene clusters, including cellulose synthesis, type iii secretion system (t3ss) and flagellar genes. the d. dadantii  cellulose synthesis operon is homologous to that of gluconacetobacter xylinus, which is used for industrial cellulose production, and the cellulose nanofibres produced by d. dadantii were similar in diameter and branching pattern to those produced by g. xylinus. salmonella enterica, an enterobacterium closely related to d. dadantii, encodes a second type of cellulose synthesis operon, and it produced biofilm strands that differed in width and branching pattern from those  of d. dadantii and g. xylinus. unlike any previously described cellulose fibre, the d. dadantii cellulose nanofibres were decorated with bead-like structures. mutation of the cellulose synthesis operon genes resulted in loss of cellulose synthesis and production of a cellulase-resistant biofilm. mutation of other genes required for pellicle formation, including those encoding flia (a sigma factor that regulates flagella production), hrpl (a sigma factor that regulates the t3ss), and adra, a ggdef protein, affected both biofilm and cell morphology.  mutation of the cellulose synthase bcsa or of bcsc resulted in decreased accumulation of the t3ss-secreted protein hrpn.

TI  == toxin on a stick: modular cdi toxin delivery systems play roles in bacterial competition.
AB  == contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi) is the first contact-dependent competition system identified in bacteria. cdi is mediated by the cdia/cdib two-partner secretion system, and the bama outer membrane protein serves as the cdi receptor on target cells. a small immunity protein, cdii, is required to protect inhibitor cells from their own cdi system. recent results from our group  show that cdi systems are present in a number of important gram-negative plant and animal pathogens. the c-terminal region of cdia (cdia-ct) is polymorphic and  contains growth inhibitory activity. the cdia-ct from uropathogenic esherichia coli 536 is a trnase whereas a cdia-ct from dickeya dadantii 3937 has dnase activity. accordingly, these bacteria contain distinct cdii proteins, which specifically bind and inactivate cognate cdia-ct. remarkably, cdia-cts are modular: one cdia "stick" can deliver different cdia-ct toxins. we discuss these  findings as well as results showing that cdi plays an important role in intra-strain bacterial competition in the natural world. a detailed mechanistic understanding of cdi could facilitate development of probiotics and antimicrobials that target specific pathogens.

AB  == background: quantitative rt-pcr is the method of choice for studying, with both sensitivity and accuracy, the expression of genes. a reliable normalization of the data, using several reference genes, is critical for an accurate quantification of gene expression. here, we propose a set of reference genes, of  the phytopathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii and pectobacterium atrosepticum, which are stable in a wide range of growth conditions. results: we extracted, from a d. dadantii micro-array transcript profile dataset comprising thirty-two different growth conditions, an initial set of 49 expressed genes with very low variation in gene expression. out of these, we retained 10 genes representing different functional categories, different levels of expression (low, medium, and high) and with no systematic variation in expression correlating with growth conditions. we measured the expression of these reference gene candidates using quantitative rt-pcr in 50 different experimental conditions, mimicking the environment encountered by the bacteria in their host and directly during the infection process in planta. the two most stable genes (abf-0017965 (lpxc) and abf-0020529 (yafs) were successfully used for normalization of rt-qpcr data. finally, we demonstrated that the ortholog of lpxc and yafs in pectobacterium atrosepticum also showed stable expression in diverse growth conditions. conclusions: we have identified at least two genes, lpxc (abf-0017965) and yafs (abf-0020509), whose expressions are stable in a wide range of growth conditions  and during infection. thus, these genes are considered suitable for use as reference genes for the normalization of real-time rt-qpcr data of the two main pectinolytic phytopathogenic bacteria d. dadantii and p. atrosepticum and, probably, of other enterobacteriaceae. moreover, we defined general criteria to select good reference genes in bacteria.

AB  == on water deficit, abscisic acid (aba) induces stomata closure to reduce water loss by transpiration. to identify arabidopsis thaliana mutants which transpire less on drought, infrared thermal imaging of leaf temperature has been used to screen for suppressors of an aba-deficient mutant (aba3-1) cold-leaf phenotype. three novel mutants, called hot aba-deficiency suppressor (has), have been identified with hot-leaf phenotypes in the absence of the aba3 mutation. the defective genes imparted no apparent modification to aba production on water deficit, were inherited recessively and enhanced aba responses indicating that the proteins encoded are negative regulators of aba signalling. all three mutants showed aba-hypersensitive stomata closure and inhibition of root elongation with  little modification of growth and development in non-stressed conditions. the has2 mutant also exhibited increased germination inhibition by aba, while aba-inducible gene expression was not modified on dehydration, indicating the mutated gene affects early aba-signalling responses that do not modify transcript levels. in contrast, weak aba-hypersensitivity relative to mutant developmental phenotypes suggests that has3 regulates drought responses by both aba-dependent and independent pathways. has1 mutant phenotypes were only apparent on stress or  aba treatments, and included reduced water loss on rapid dehydration. the has1 locus thus has the required characteristics for a targeted approach to improving  resistance to water deficit. in contrast to has2, has1 exhibited only minor changes in susceptibility to dickeya dadantii despite similar aba-hypersensitivity, indicating that crosstalk between aba responses to this pathogen and drought stress can occur through more than one point in the signalling pathway.

TI  == analysis of the plant bos1 mutant highlights necrosis as an efficient defence mechanism during d. dadantii/arabidospis thaliana interaction.
AB  == dickeya dadantii is a broad host range phytopathogenic bacterium provoking soft rot disease on many plants including arabidopsis. we showed that, after d. dadantii infection, the expression of the arabidopsis bos1 gene was specifically  induced by the production of the bacterial pelb/c pectinases able to degrade pectin. this prompted us to analyze the interaction between the bos1 mutant and d. dadantii. the phenotype of the infected bos1 mutant is complex. indeed, maceration symptoms occurred more rapidly in the bos1 mutant than in the wild type parent but at a later stage of infection, a necrosis developed around the inoculation site that provoked a halt in the progression of the maceration. this  necrosis became systemic and spread throughout the whole plant, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed in some lesion mimic mutants. in accordance with the progression of maceration symptoms, bacterial population began to grow more rapidly in the bos1 mutant than in the wild type plant but, when necrosis appeared in the bos1 mutant, a reduction in bacterial population was observed. from the plant side, this complex interaction between d. dadantii and its host includes an early plant defence response that comprises reactive oxygen species (ros) production accompanied by the reinforcement of the plant cell wall by protein cross-linking. at later timepoints, another plant defence is raised by the death of the plant cells surrounding the inoculation site. this plant cell death appears to constitute an efficient defence mechanism induced by d. dadantii during arabidopsis infection.

TI  == tmrna regulates synthesis of the arfa ribosome rescue factor.
AB  == translation of mrna lacking an in-frame stop codon leads to ribosome arrest at the 3' end of the transcript. in bacteria, the tmrna quality control system recycles these stalled ribosomes and tags the incomplete nascent chains for degradation. although ubiquitous in eubacteria, the ssra gene encoding tmrna is not essential for the viability of escherichia coli and other model bacterial species. arfa (yhdl) is a mediator of tmrna-independent ribosome rescue that is essential for the viability of e. colideltassra mutants. here, we demonstrate that arfa is synthesized from truncated mrna and therefore regulated by tmrna tagging activity. rnase iii cleaves a hairpin structure within the arfa-coding sequence to produce transcripts that lack stop codons. in the absence of tmrna tagging, truncated arfa chains are released from the ribosome. the truncated arfadelta18 protein (which lacks 18 c-terminal residues) is functional in ribosome rescue and supports deltassra cell viability when expressed from the arfa locus. other proteobacterial arfa genes also encode hairpins, and transcripts from dickeya dadantii and salmonella typhimurium are cleaved by rnase iii when expressed in e. coli. thus, synthesis of arfa from truncated mrna appears to be a general mechanism to regulate alternative ribosome rescue activity.

TI  == identification of two feruloyl esterases in dickeya dadantii 3937 and induction of the major feruloyl esterase and of pectate lyases by ferulic acid.
AB  == the plant-pathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) produces a large array of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. using an in situ detection test, we showed that it produces two feruloyl esterases, faed and faet. these enzymes cleave the ester link between ferulate and the pectic or xylan chains. faed and faet belong to the carbohydrate esterase family ce10, and they are the first two feruloyl esterases to be identified in this family. cleavage of synthetic substrates revealed strong activation of faed and faet by ferulic acid. the gene faet appeared to be weakly expressed, and its product, faet, is a cytoplasmic protein. in contrast, the gene faed is strongly induced in the presence of ferulic acid, and faed is an extracellular protein secreted by the out system, responsible for pectinase secretion. the product of the adjacent gene faer is involved in the positive control of faed in response to ferulic acid. moreover, ferulic acid acts in synergy with polygalacturonate to induce pectate lyases, the main virulence determinant of soft rot disease. feruloyl esterases dissociate internal cross-links in the polysaccharide network of the plant cell wall, suppress the polysaccharide esterifications, and liberate ferulic acid, which contributes to the induction of pectate lyases. together, these effects of  feruloyl esterases could facilitate soft rot disease caused by pectinolytic bacteria.

TI  == a widespread family of polymorphic contact-dependent toxin delivery systems in bacteria.
AB  == bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with one another in diverse environments. a new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (cdi), was discovered recently in escherichia coli. cdi is mediated by the cdib/cdia two-partner secretion (tps) system. cdib facilitates secretion of the cdia 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. an additional small immunity protein (cdii) protects cdi(+) cells from autoinhibition. the mechanisms by which cdi blocks cell growth and by which cdii  counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. moreover, the existence of cdi activity in other bacteria has not been explored. here we show that the cdi growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of cdia (cdia-ct), and that cdii binds and inactivates cognate cdia-ct, but not heterologous cdia-ct. bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple  bacterial species encode functional cdi systems with high sequence variability in the cdia-ct and cdii coding regions. cdia-ct heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during cdi. indeed, cdia-cts from uropathogenic e. coli and the plant pathogen dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities,  each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. finally, we show that bacteria lacking the cdia-ct and cdii coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type cdi(+) cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. taken together, these results suggest that cdi systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition.

TI  == commensal effect of pectate lyases secreted from dickeya dadantii on proliferation of escherichia coli o157:h7 edl933 on lettuce leaves.
AB  == the outbreaks caused by enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 on leafy greens have raised serious and immediate food safety concerns. it has been suggested that several phytopathogens aid in the persistence and proliferation of the human enteropathogens in the phyllosphere. in this work, we examined the influence of virulence mechanisms of dickeya dadantii 3937, a broad-host-range phytopathogen, on the proliferation of the human pathogen e. coli o157:h7 edl933  (edl933) on postharvest lettuce by coinoculation of edl933 with d. dadantii 3937  derivatives that have mutations in virulence-related genes. a type ii secretion system (t2ss)-deficient mutant of d. dadantii 3937, a1919 (deltaoutc), lost the capability to promote the multiplication of edl933, whereas ech159 (deltarpos), a stress-responsive sigma factor rpos-deficient mutant, increased edl933 proliferation on lettuce leaves. a spectrophotometric enzyme activity assay revealed that a1919 (deltaoutc) was completely deficient in the secretion of pectate lyases (pels), which play a major role in plant tissue maceration. in contrast to a1919 (deltaoutc), ech159 (deltarpos) showed more than 2-fold-greater pel activity than the wild-type d. dadantii 3937. increased expression of peld (encodes an endo-pectate lyase) was observed in ech159 (deltarpos) in planta. these results suggest that the pectinolytic activity of d. dadantii 3937 is the dominant determinant of enhanced edl933 proliferation on the lettuce leaves. in addition, rpos, the general stress response sigma factor involved in cell survival in suboptimal conditions, plays a role in edl933 proliferation by controlling the production of pectate lyases in d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == systematic targeted mutagenesis of the marr/slya family members of dickeya dadantii 3937 reveals a role for mfbr in the modulation of virulence gene expression in response to acidic ph.
AB  == pathogenicity of dickeya dadantii is a process involving several factors, such as plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and adaptation systems to adverse conditions encountered in the apoplast. regulators of the marr family control a variety of biological processes, including adaptation to hostile environments and virulence. analysis of the members of this family in d. dadantii led to the identification of a new regulator, mfbr, which controls virulence. mfbr represses its own expression but activates genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes. purified mfbr increases the binding of rna polymerase at the virulence gene promoters and inhibits transcription initiation at the mfbr promoter. mfbr activity appeared to be modulated by acidic ph, a stress encountered by pathogens during the early stages of infection. expression of mfbr and its targets, during  infection, showed that mfbr is unable to activate virulence genes in acidic conditions at an early step of infection. in contrast, alkalinization of the apoplast, during an advanced stage of infection, led to the potentialization of mfbr activity resulting in plant cell wall degrading enzyme production. this report presents a new example of how pathogens adjust virulence-associated factors during the time-course of an infection.

TI  == specificity of monoclonal antibodies to strains of dickeya sp. that cause bacterial heart rot of pineapple.
AB  == during a severe outbreak of bacterial heart rot that occurred in pineapple plantations on oahu, hawaii, in 2003 and years following, 43 bacterial strains were isolated from diseased plants or irrigation water and identified as erwinia  chrysanthemi (now dickeya sp.) by phenotypic, molecular, and pathogenicity assays. rep-pcr fingerprint patterns grouped strains from pineapple plants and irrigation water into five genotypes (a-e) that differed from representatives of  other dickeya species, pectobacterium carotovorum and other enteric saprophytes isolated from pineapple. monoclonal antibodies produced following immunization of mice with virulent type c dickeya sp. showed only two specificities. mab pine-1 (2d11g1, igg1 with kappa light chain) reacted to all 43 pineapple/water strains and some reference strains (d. dianthicola, d. chrysanthemi, d. paradisiaca, some d. dadantii, and uncharacterized dickeya sp.) but did not react to reference strains of d. dieffenbachiae, d. zeae, or one of the two malaysian pineapple strains. mab pine-2 (2a7f2, igg3 with kappa light chain) reacted to all type b, c, and d strains but not to any a or e strains or any reference strains except dickeya sp. isolated from malaysian pineapple. pathogenicity tests showed that type c strains were more aggressive than type a strains when inoculated during cool months. therefore, mab pine-2 distinguishes the more virulent type c strains from less virulent type a pineapple strains and type e water strains. mabs with these two specificities enable development of rapid diagnostic tests that will distinguish the systemic heart rot pathogen from opportunistic bacteria associated with rotted tissues. use of the two mabs in field assays also permits  the monitoring of a known subpopulation and provides additional decision tools for disease containment and management practices.

TI  == genome-wide identification of hrpl-regulated genes in the necrotrophic phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii is a necrotrophic pathogen causing disease in many plants. previous studies have demonstrated that the type iii secretion system (t3ss) of d. dadantii is required for full virulence. hrpl is an alternative sigma factor that binds to the hrp box promoter sequence of t3ss genes to up-regulate their expression. methodology/principal findings: to explore the inventory of hrpl-regulated genes of d. dadantii 3937 (3937), transcriptome profiles of wild-type 3937 and a hrpl mutant grown in a t3ss-inducing medium were examined. using a cut-off value of 1.5, significant differential expression was observed in sixty-three genes, which are involved in various cellular functions such as type iii secretion, chemotaxis, metabolism, regulation, and stress response. a hidden markov model (hmm) was used to predict candidate hrp box binding sites in the intergenic regions of 3937, including the promoter regions of hrpl-regulated genes identified in the microarray assay. in contrast to biotrophic phytopathgens such as pseudomonas syringae, among the hrpl up-regulated genes in 3937 only those within the t3ss were found to contain a hrp box sequence. moreover, direct binding of purified hrpl protein to the hrp box was demonstrated for hrp box-containing dna fragments of hrpa and hrpn using the  electrophoretic mobility shift assay (emsa). in this study, a putative t3ss effector dspa/e was also identified as a hrpl-upregulated gene, and shown to be translocated into plant cells in a t3ss-dependent manner. conclusion/significances: we provide the genome-wide study of hrpl-regulated genes in a necrotrophic phytopathogen (d. dadantii 3937) through a combination of transcriptomics and bioinformatics, which led to identification of several effectors. our study indicates the extent of differences for t3ss effector protein inventory requirements between necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens, and may allow the development of different strategies for disease control for these different groups of pathogens.

TI  == regulatory mechanisms of exoribonuclease pnpase and regulatory small rna on t3ss  of dickeya dadantii.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (t3ss) is an essential virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens. polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase) is one of the major exoribonucleases in bacteria and plays important roles in mrna degradation, trna  processing, and small rna (srna) turnover. in this study, we showed that pnpase downregulates the transcription of t3ss structural and effector genes of the phytopathogenic bacterium dickeya dadantii. this negative regulation of t3ss by pnpase occurs by repressing the expression of hrpl, encoding a master regulator of t3ss in d. dadantii. by reducing rpon mrna stability, pnpase downregulates the transcription of hrpl, which leads to a reduction in t3ss gene expression. moreover, we have found that pnpase downregulates t3ss by decreasing hrpl mrna stability. rsmb, a regulatory srna, enhances hrpl mrna stability in d. dadantii.  our results suggest that pnpase decreases the amount of functional rsmb transcripts that could result in reduction of hrpl mrna stability. in addition, bistable gene expression (differential expression of a single gene that creates two distinct subpopulations) of hrpa, hrpn, and dspe was observed in d. dadantii  under in vitro conditions. although pnpase regulates the proportion of cells in the high state and the low state of t3ss gene expression, it appears that pnpase  is not the key switch that triggers the bistable expression patterns of t3ss genes.

TI  == cyt toxin expression reveals an inverse regulation of insect and plant virulence  factors of dickeya dadantii.
AB  == the plant pathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii is also a pathogen of the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum. the genome of the bacteria contains four cyt genes, encoding homologues of bacillus thuringiensis cyt toxins, which are involved in its pathogenicity to insects. we show here that these genes are transcribed as an operon, and we determined the conditions necessary for their expression. their expression is induced at high temperature and at an osmolarity equivalent to that found in the plant phloem sap. the regulators of cyt genes have also been identified: their expression is repressed by h-ns and vfme and activated by pecs. these genes are already known to regulate plant virulence factors, but in an opposite way. when tested in a virulence assay by ingestion, the pecs mutant was  almost non-pathogenic while hns and vfme mutants behaved in the same way as the wild-type strain. mutants of other regulators of plant virulence, gaca, ompr and  phop, that do not control cyt toxin production, also showed reduced pathogenicity. in an assay by injection of bacteria, the gaca strain was less pathogenic but, surprisingly, the pecs mutant was slightly more virulent. these results show that cyt toxins are not the only virulence factors required to kill  aphids, and that these factors act at different stages of the infection. moreover, their production is controlled by general virulence regulators known for their role in plant virulence. this integration could indicate that virulence towards insects is a normal mode of life for d. dadantii.

TI  == genetic analysis of two phosphodiesterases reveals cyclic diguanylate regulation  of virulence factors in dickeya dadantii.
AB  == cyclic diguanylate (c-di-gmp) is a second messenger implicated in the regulation  of various cellular properties in several bacterial species. however, its function in phytopathogenic bacteria is not yet understood. in this study we investigated a panel of ggdef/eal domain proteins which have the potential to regulate c-di-gmp levels in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii 3937. two proteins, ecpb (contains ggdef and eal domains) and ecpc (contains an eal domain) were shown to regulate multiple cellular behaviours and virulence gene expression. deletion of ecpb and/or ecpc enhanced biofilm formation but repressed swimming/swarming motility. in addition, the ecpb and ecpc mutants displayed a significant reduction in pectate lyase production, a virulence factor of this bacterium. gene expression analysis showed that deletion of ecpb and ecpc significantly reduced expression of the type iii secretion system (t3ss) and its  virulence effector proteins. expression of the t3ss genes is regulated by hrpl and possibly rpon, two alternative sigma factors. in vitro biochemical assays showed that ecpc has phosphodiesterase activity to hydrolyse c-di-gmp into linear pgpg. most of the enterobacterial pathogens encode at least one t3ss, a major virulence factor which functions to subvert host defences. the current study broadens our understanding of the interplay between c-di-gmp, rpon and t3ss and the potential role of c-di-gmp in t3ss regulation among a wide range of bacterial pathogens.

TI  == toward a quantitative modeling of the synthesis of the pectate lyases, essential  virulence factors in dickeya dadantii.
AB  == a dynamic mathematical model has been developed and validated to describe the synthesis of pectate lyases (pels), the major virulence factors in dickeya dadantii. this work focuses on the simultaneous modeling of the metabolic degradation of pectin by pel enzymes and the genetic regulation of pel genes by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (kdg), a catabolite product of pectin that inactivates kdgr, one of the main repressors of pel genes. this modeling scheme takes into account the fact that the system is composed of two time-varying compartments: the extracellular medium, where pel enzymes cleave pectin into oligomers, and the bacterial cytoplasm where, after internalization, oligomers are converted to kdg. using the quasi-stationary state approximations, the model consists of some nonlinear differential equations for which most of the parameters could be estimated from the literature or from independent experiments. the few remaining  unknown parameters were obtained by fitting the model equations against a set of  pel activity data. model predictions were verified by measuring the time courses  of bacterial growth, pel production, pel mrna accumulation, and pectin consumption under various growth conditions. this work reveals that pectin is almost totally consumed before the burst of pel production. this paradoxical behavior can be interpreted as an evolutionary strategy to control the diffusion  process so that as soon as a small amount of pectin is detected by the bacteria in its surroundings, it anticipates more pectin to come. the model also predicts  the possibility of bistable steady states in the presence of constant pectin compounds.

TI  == clpxp protease regulates the type iii secretion system of dickeya dadantii 3937 and is essential for the bacterial virulence.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (t3ss) is considered one of the major virulence factors in many bacterial pathogens. this report demonstrates that rssb, clpxp, and rpos play a role in t3ss regulation of dickeya dadantii 3937. clpp is a serine-type protease which associates with the clpx chaperone to form a functional clp proteolytic complex for degradation of proteins. with the assistance of recognition factor rssb, clpxp degrades the rpos sigma factor. rpos positively regulates the expression of the rsma gene encoding an rna-binding regulatory protein. by interacting with the hrpl mrna, rsma reduces hrpl production and downregulates the t3ss genes in the hrpl regulon. in addition, clpxp, rssb, and rpos affect pectinolytic enzyme production in d. dadantii 3937,  probably through rsma. the clpxp and rssb proteins are essential for bacterial virulence.

AB  == dickeya dadantii is a pectinolytic phytopathogen enterobacterium that causes soft rot disease on a wide range of plant species. the virulence of d. dadantii involves several factors, including the osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (opgs)  that are general constituents of the envelope of proteobacteria. in addition to the loss of virulence, opg-negative mutants display a pleiotropic phenotype, including decreased motility and increased exopolysaccharide synthesis. a nitrosoguanidine-induced mutagenesis was performed on the opgg strain, and restoration of motility was used as a screen. the phenotype of the opg mutant echoes that of the rcs system: high level activation of the rcscd-rcsb phosphorelay is needed to activate exopolysaccharide synthesis and to repress motility, while low level activation is required for virulence in enterobacteria. here, we show that mutations in the rcscdb phosphorelay system restored virulence and motility in a d. dadantii opg-negative strain, indicating a relationship between the rcs phosphorelay and opgs.

TI  == bacterial chemoattraction towards jasmonate plays a role in the entry of dickeya  dadantii through wounded tissues.
AB  == jasmonate is a key signalling compound in plant defence that is synthesized in wounded tissues. in this work, we have found that this molecule is also a strong  chemoattractant for the phythopathogenic bacteria dickeya dadantii (ex-erwinia chysanthemi). jasmonic acid induced the expression of a subset of bacterial genes possibly involved in virulence/survival in the plant apoplast and bacterial cells pre-treated with jasmonate showed increased virulence in chicory and saintpaulia  leaves. we also showed that tissue wounding induced bacterial spread through the  leaf surface. moreover, the jasmonate-deficient aos1 arabidopsis thaliana mutant  was more resistant to bacterial invasion by d. dadantii than wild-type plants. these results are consistent with the hypothesis that sensing jasmonic acid by this bacterium helps the pathogen to ingress inside plant tissues.

AB  == erwinia chrysanthemi (dickeya dadantii) is a plant pathogenic bacterium that has  a large capacity to degrade the plant cell wall polysaccharides. the present study reports the metabolic pathways used by e. chrysanthemi to assimilate the oligosaccharides sucrose and raffinose, which are particularly abundant plant sugars. e. chrysanthemi is able to use sucrose, raffinose, or melibiose as a sole carbon source for growth. the two gene clusters scrkyabr and rafrba are necessary for their catabolism. the phenotypic analysis of scr and raf mutants revealed cross-links between the assimilation pathways of these oligosaccharides. sucrose  catabolism is mediated by the genes scrkyab. while the raf cluster is sufficient  to catabolize melibiose, it is incomplete for raffinose catabolism, which needs two additional steps that are provided by scry and scrb. the scr and raf clusters are controlled by specific repressors, scrr and rafr, respectively. both clusters are controlled by the global activator of carbohydrate catabolism, the cyclic amp receptor protein (crp). e. chrysanthemi growth with lactose is possible only for  mutants with a derepressed nonspecific lactose transport system, which was identified as rafb. rafr inactivation allows the bacteria to the assimilate the novel substrates lactose, lactulose, stachyose, and melibionic acid. the raf genes also are involved in the assimilation of alpha- and beta-methyl-d-galactosides. mutations in the raf or scr genes did not significantly affect e. chrysanthemi virulence. this could be explained by the large variety of carbon sources available in the plant tissue macerated by e. chrysanthemi.

TI  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation analysis incorporating genomic organisation, and application to enterobacterial plant pathogens.
AB  == microarray comparative genomic hybridisation (acgh) provides an estimate of the relative abundance of genomic dna (gdna) taken from comparator and reference organisms by hybridisation to a microarray containing probes that represent sequences from the reference organism. the experimental method is used in a number of biological applications, including the detection of human chromosomal aberrations, and in comparative genomic analysis of bacterial strains, but optimisation of the analysis is desirable in each problem domain.we present a method for analysis of bacterial acgh data that encodes spatial information from  the reference genome in a hidden markov model. this technique is the first such method to be validated in comparisons of sequenced bacteria that diverge at the strain and at the genus level: pectobacterium atrosepticum scri1043 (pba1043) and dickeya dadantii 3937 (dda3937); and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis il1403 and  l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363. in all cases our method is found to outperform  common and widely used acgh analysis methods that do not incorporate spatial information. this analysis is applied to comparisons between commercially important plant pathogenic soft-rotting enterobacteria (sre) pba1043, p. atrosepticum scri1039, p. carotovorum 193, and dda3937.our analysis indicates that it should not be assumed that hybridisation strength is a reliable proxy for sequence identity in acgh experiments, and robustly extends the applicability of  acgh to bacterial comparisons at the genus level. our results in the sre further  provide evidence for a dynamic, plastic 'accessory' genome, revealing major genomic islands encoding gene products that provide insight into, and may play a  direct role in determining, variation amongst the sre in terms of their environmental survival, host range and aetiology, such as phytotoxin synthesis, multidrug resistance, and nitrogen fixation.

AB  == using sequences from the reca locus, we have produced a phylogeny of 188 dickeya  strains from culture collections and identified species relatedness and subspecies clade structure within the genus. of the six recognized species, dickeya paradisiaca, d. chrysanthemi and d. zeae were discriminated with long branch lengths. the clade containing the d. paradisiaca type strain included just one additional strain, isolated from banana in colombia. strains isolated from chrysanthemum and parthenium species made up most of the clade containing the d.  chrysanthemi type strain, and the host range of this species was extended to include potato. the d. zeae clade had the largest number of sequevars and branched into two major sister clades that contained all of the zea mays isolates, and were identified as phylotypes pi and pii. the host range was increased from six to 13 species, including potato. the reca sequence of an australian sugar-cane strain was sufficiently distinct to rank as a new species-level branch. in contrast to these species, dickeya dadantii, d. dianthicola and d. dieffenbachiae were distinguished with shorter branch lengths, indicating relatively closer relatedness. the reca sequence for the type strain of d. dadantii clustered separately from other strains of the species. however, sequence comparison of three additional loci revealed that the d. dadantii type strain grouped together with the six other d. dadantii strains that were sequenced. analysis of all four loci indicated that the d. dadantii strains were  most closely related to d. dieffenbachiae. three further branches (duc-1, -2 and  -3) were associated with these three species, which all diverged from a common origin and can be considered as a species complex. the large clade containing the d. dianthicola type strain comprised 58 strains and had little sequence diversity. one sequevar accounted for the majority of these strains, which were isolated nearly exclusively from eight hosts from europe. isolation of this sequevar on multiple occasions from dianthus and (more recently) potato demonstrates that this lineage has become established in these species. the d. dadantii clade comprised 11 sequevars, and the known host range of the species was extended from eight to 19 species. new hosts included several ornamental species and potato. the clade duc-1 was made up exclusively of potato strains originating from europe, which had identical sequences, whilst duc-2 strains were isolated mostly from a variety of monocotyledonous species. a single strain from  aglaonema sp. made up duc-3. a single sequevar constituted the d. dieffenbachiae  clade. the phylogenetic method described will provide a simple means for identification to the species and intraspecies level, which will support efforts  to control these pathogens based on monitoring and surveillance.

TI  == slya, a marr family transcriptional regulator, is essential for virulence in dickeya dadantii 3937.
AB  == slya, a marr family transcriptional regulator, controls an assortment of biological functions in several animal-pathogenic bacteria. in order to elucidate the functions of slya in the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) 3937, a slya gene deletion mutant (denoted deltaslya) was constructed. the mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to sodium hypochlorite, the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymyxin b, and oxidative stress. the mutant  showed reduced production of pectate lyase and exopolysaccharide and an inability to form a pellicle. the mutant lacking a functional slya gene showed a significantly reduced ability to cause maceration of potato tubers. accordingly,  the mutant exhibited significantly reduced bacterial growth and failed to hyperinduce pectate lyase production in planta. introduction of a plasmid containing slya into the deltaslya mutant caused all of these phenotypes to recover to wild-type levels. these results suggest that slya plays an important role in virulence to plants by positively regulating the expression of multiple pathogenicity-related traits of d. dadantii 3937.

TI  == role of motility and chemotaxis in the pathogenesis of dickeya dadantii 3937 (ex  erwinia chrysanthemi 3937).
AB  == dickeya dadantii 3937 (ex erwinia chrysanthemi), a member of the enterobacteriaceae, causes soft rot in many economically important crops. a successful pathogen has to reach the interior of the plant in order to cause disease. to study the role of motility and chemotaxis in the pathogenicity of d.  dadantii 3937, genes involved in the chemotactic signal transduction system (chew, cheb, chey and chez) and in the structure of the flagellar motor (mota) were mutagenized. all the mutant strains grew like the wild-type in culture media, and the production and secretion of pectolytic enzymes was not affected. as expected, the swimming ability of the mutant strains was reduced with respect  to the wild-type: mota (94%), chey (80%), chew (74%), cheb (54%) and chez (48%).  the virulence of the mutant strains was analysed in chicory, saintpaulia and potato. the mutant strains were also tested for their capability to enter into arabidopsis leaves. all the mutants showed a significant decrease of virulence in certain hosts; however, the degree of virulence reduction varied depending on the virulence assay. the ability to penetrate arabidopsis leaves was impaired in all  the mutants, whereas the capacity to colonize potato tubers after artificial inoculation was affected in only two mutant strains. in general, the virulence of the mutants could be ranked as mota<chey<cheb=chew<chez, which correlated with the degree to which swimming was affected. these results clearly indicate that motility plays an important role in the pathogenicity of this bacterium.

TI  == the plant phenolic compound p-coumaric acid represses gene expression in the dickeya dadantii type iii secretion system.
AB  == the type iii secretion system (t3ss) is a major virulence factor in many gram-negative bacterial pathogens. this secretion system translocates effectors directly into the cytosol of eukaryotic host cells, where the effector proteins facilitate bacterial pathogenesis by interfering with host cell signal transduction and other cellular processes. plants defend themselves against bacterial pathogens by recognizing either the type 3 effectors or their actions and initiating a cascade of defense responses that often results in programmed cell death of the plant cell being attacked. here we show that a plant phenolic compound, p-coumaric acid (pca), represses the expression of t3ss genes of the plant pathogen dickeya dadantii, suggesting that plants can also defend against bacterial pathogens by manipulating the expression of the t3ss. pca repressed the expression of t3ss regulatory genes through the hrpx/y two-component system, a core regulator of the t3ss, rather than through the global regulator gacs/a, which indirectly regulates the t3ss. a further analysis of several pca analogs suggests that the para positioning of the hydroxyl group in the phenyl ring and the double bond of pca may be important for its biological activity.

TI  == distinguishing bacterial pathogens of potato using a genome-wide microarray approach.
AB  == a set of 9676 probes was designed for the most harmful bacterial pathogens of potato and tested in a microarray format. gene-specific probes could be designed  for all genes of pectobacterium atrosepticum, c. 50% of the genes of streptomyces scabies and c. 30% of the genes of clavibacter michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus utilizing the whole-genome sequence information available. for streptomyces turgidiscabies, 226 probes were designed according to the sequences of a pathogenicity island containing important virulence genes. in addition, probes were designed for the virulence-associated nip (necrosis-inducing protein) genes  of p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya dadantii and for the intergenic spacer (igs) sequences of the 16s-23s rrna gene region. ralstonia solanacearum was not included in the study, because it is a quarantine organism and is not presently found in finland, but a few probes were also designed for this species. the probes contained on average 40 target-specific nucleotides and were synthesized on the array in situ, organized as eight sub-arrays with an identical set of probes which could be used for hybridization with different samples. all bacteria were readily distinguished using a single channel system for signal detection. nearly all of the c. 1000 probes designed for c. michiganensis ssp. sepedonicus, c. 50% and 40% of the c. 4000 probes designed for the genes of s. scabies and p. atrosepticum, respectively, and over 100 probes for s. turgidiscabies showed significant signals only with the respective species. p. atrosepticum, p. carotovorum and dickeya strains were all detected with 110 common probes. by contrast, the strains of these species were found to differ in  their signal profiles. probes targeting the igs region and nip genes could be used to place strains of dickeya to two groups, which correlated with differences in virulence. taken together, the approach of using a custom-designed, genome-wide microarray provided a robust means for distinguishing the bacterial pathogens of potato.

TI  == analysis of the laci family regulators of erwinia chrysanthemi 3937, involvement  in the bacterial phytopathogenicity.
AB  == analysis of the regulators of the laci family was performed in order to identify  those potentially involved in pathogenicity of erwinia chrysanthemi (dickeya dadantii). among the 18 members of the laci family, the function of 11 members is either known or predicted and only 7 members have, as yet, no proposed function.  inactivation of these seven genes, called lfar, lfbr, lfcr, lfdr, lfer, lffr, and lfgr, demonstrated that four of them are important for plant infection. the lfar  and lfcr mutants showed a reduced virulence on chicory, saintpaulia sp., and arabidopsis. the lfer mutant showed a reduced virulence on arabidopsis. the lfdr  mutant was more efficient than the wild-type strain in initiating maceration on saintpaulia sp. the genetic environment of each regulator was examined to detect  adjacent genes potentially involved in a common function. construction of transcriptional fusions in these neighboring genes demonstrated that five regulators, lfar, lfcr, lfer, lffr, and lfgr, act as repressors of adjacent genes. analysis of these fusions also indicated that the genes controlled by lfar, lfcr, lfgr, and lffr are expressed during plant infection. moreover, addition of crude plant extracts to culture medium demonstrated that the expression of the lfar- and lfgr-controlled genes is specifically induced by plant components.

TI  == the flagellar sigma factor flia is required for dickeya dadantii virulence.
AB  == the genome sequence of the enterobacteriaceae phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (formerly erwinia chrysanthemi) revealed homologs of genes required for a complete flagellar secretion system and one flagellin gene. we found that d. dadantii was able to swim and swarm but that ability to swarm was dependent upon  both growth media and temperature. mutation of the d. dadantii flia gene was pleiotropic, with the alternate sigma factor required for flagella production and development of disease symptoms but not bacterial growth in nicotiana benthamiana leaves. the flagellar sigma factor was also required for multiple bacterial phenotypes, including biofilm formation in culture, bacterial adherence to plant  tissue, and full expression of pectate lyase activity (but not cellulase or protease activity). surprisingly, mutation of flia resulted in the increased expression of avrl (a gene of unknown function in d. dadantii) and two pectate lyase gene homologs, pelx and abf-0019391. because flia is a key contributor to virulence in d. dadantii, it is a new target for disease control.

TI  == pecs is a global regulator of the symptomatic phase in the phytopathogenic bacterium erwinia chrysanthemi 3937.
AB  == pathogenicity of the enterobacterium erwinia chrysanthemi (dickeya dadantii), the causative agent of soft-rot disease in many plants, is a complex process involving several factors whose production is subject to temporal regulation during infection. pecs is a transcriptional regulator that controls production of various virulence factors. here, we used microarray analysis to define the pecs regulon and demonstrated that pecs notably regulates a wide range of genes that could be linked to pathogenicity and to a group of genes concerned with evading host defenses. among the targets are the genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and secretion systems and the genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis, biosurfactant production, and the oxidative stress response, as well as genes encoding toxin-like factors such as nipe and hemolysin-coregulated proteins. in vitro experiments demonstrated that pecs interacts with the regulatory regions of five new targets: an oxidative stress response gene (ahpc), a biosurfactant synthesis gene (rhla), and genes encoding exported proteins related to other plant-associated bacterial proteins (nipe, virk, and avrl). the pecs mutant provokes symptoms more rapidly and with more efficiency than the wild-type strain, indicating that pecs plays a critical role in the switch from the asymptomatic phase to the symptomatic phase. based on this, we propose that the temporal regulation of the different groups of genes required for the asymptomatic phase and the symptomatic phase is, in part, the result of a gradual modulation of pecs activity triggered during infection in response to changes in  environmental conditions emerging from the interaction between both partners.

TI  == type iii secretion system genes of dickeya dadantii 3937 are induced by plant phenolic acids.
AB  == background: dickeya dadantii is a broad-host range phytopathogen. d. dadantii 3937 (ech3937) possesses a type iii secretion system (t3ss), a major virulence factor secretion system in many gram-negative pathogens of plants and animals. in ech3937, the t3ss is regulated by two major regulatory pathways, hrpx/hrpy-hrps-hrpl and gacs/gaca-rsmb-rsma pathways. although the plant apoplast environment, low ph, low temperature, and absence of complex nitrogen sources in  media have been associated with the induction of t3ss genes of phytobacteria, no  specific inducer has yet been identified. methodology/principal findings: in this work, we identified two novel plant phenolic compounds, o-coumaric acid (oca) and t-cinnamic acid (tca), that induced the expression of t3ss genes dspe (a t3ss effector), hrpa (a structural protein of the t3ss pilus), and hrpn (a t3ss harpin) in vitro. assays by qrt-pcr showed higher amounts of mrna of hrpl (a t3ss alternative sigma factor) and rsmb (an untranslated regulatory rna), but not hrps (a sigma(54)-enhancer binding protein) of ech3937 when these two plant compounds  were supplemented into minimal medium (mm). however, promoter activity assays using flow cytometry showed similar promoter activities of hrpn in rsmb mutant ech148 grown in mm and mm supplemented with these phenolic compounds. compared with mm alone, only slightly higher promoter activities of hrpl were observed in  bacterial cells grown in mm supplemented with oca/tca. conclusion/significance: the induction of t3ss expression by oca and tca is moderated through the rsmb-rsma pathway. this is the first report of plant phenolic compounds that induce the expression t3ss genes of plant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == evaluation of isolation methods and rna integrity for bacterial rna quantitation.
AB  == rna integrity is critical for successful rna quantitation for mammalian tissues,  but the level of integrity required differs among tissues. the level of integrity required for quantitation has not been determined for bacterial rna. three rna isolation methods were evaluated for their ability to produce high quality rna from dickeya dadantii, a bacterium refractory to rna isolation. bacterial lysis with trizol using standard protocols consistently gave low rna yields with this organism. higher yields due to improved bacterial cells lysis was achieved with an added hot sds incubation step, but rna quality was low as determined by the rna integrity number (rin). contaminating dna remained a problem with the hot sds-trizol method; rna samples required repeated, rigorous dnase treatments to reduce dna contamination to levels sufficient for successful real-time qrt-pcr. a hot sds-hot phenol rna method gave the highest rna quality and required only two  dnase treatments to remove dna. the assessment of rna integrity using the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer was critical for obtaining meaningful gene expression data. rin  values below 7.0 resulted in high variation and loss of statistical significance  when gene expression was analyzed by real-time qrt-pcr. we found that rna preparations of different quality yielded drastic differences in relative gene expression ratios and led to major errors in the quantification of transcript levels. this work provides guidelines for rna isolation and quality assessment that will be valuable for gene expression studies in a wide range of bacteria.

TI  == novel mechanism of outer membrane targeting of proteins in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == summary: in gram-negative bacteria, all the proteins destined for the outer membrane are synthesized with a signal sequence that is cleaved, either by the signal peptidase lepb for integral outer membrane proteins or by lspa for lipoproteins, when they cross the cytoplasmic membrane. the dickeya dadantii protein pnlh does not possess a cleavable signal sequence but is anchored in the  outer membrane by an n-terminal targeting signal. addition of the 41 n-terminal amino acids of pnlh is sufficient for anchoring various hybrid proteins in the outer membrane. this targeting signal presents some of the characteristics of a tat (twin arginine translocation) signal sequence but without an obvious cleavage site. we found that the tat translocation pathway is required for the targeting process. this new mechanism of outer membrane protein targeting is probably widespread as pnlh was also addressed to the outer membrane when expressed in escherichia coli. as pnlh was not detected as a substrate by tat signal sequence  prediction programmes, this would suggest that there may be many other unknown tat-dependent outer membrane proteins.

TI  == a new way out: protein localization on the bacterial cell surface via tat and a novel type ii secretion system.
AB  == summary: the ability to move proteins out of the cytoplasm and across membranes is a key aspect of the physiology and pathogenicity of gram-negative bacteria. in this issue of molecular microbiology, ferrandez and condemine describe a novel protein targeting system in the enteric phytopathogen, dickeya dadantii. the pectin lyase, pnlh, is exported by the tat system and is somehow targeted to the  outer membrane by its uncleaved n-terminal tat signal anchor. a novel type ii secretion system, stt, is then responsible for moving it across the outer membrane, where it remains localized on the surface of the cell. we discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of both the mechanisms and physiological importance of bacterial protein targeting.

TI  == the response regulator hrpy of dickeya dadantii 3937 regulates virulence genes not linked to the hrp cluster.
AB  == hrpx/y is a putative two-component system (tcs) encoded within the type iii secretion system (t3ss) gene cluster of dickeya dadantii. a linear regulatory cascade initiated by hrpx/y that leads to activation of the downstream t3ss genes via hrps and hrpl was described previously. therefore, in d. dadantii, hrpx/y plays an important role in regulation of genes involved in bacteria-plant interactions and bacterial aggregation via the t3ss. hrpx/y is the only tcs shared among the plant-pathogenic enterobacteria that is not also present in animal-associated enterobacteria. to date, the genes known to be regulated by hrpy are restricted to the hrp and hrc genes and no signal has been identified that triggers hrpy-dependent gene expression. we demonstrated that hrpy interacts with the hrps promoter in vitro. we then used a transposon-based system to isolate previously unidentified hrpy-dependent genes, including genes previously  shown to affect virulence, including kdgm and acsc. hrpy is a dual regulator, positively regulating at least 10 genes in addition to those in the hrp gene cluster and negatively regulating at least 5 genes. the regulatory effect on one  gene depended on the culture medium used. of the 16 hrpy-regulated genes identified in this screen, 14 are not present in pectobacterium atrosepticum, the nearest relative of d. dadantii with a sequenced genome. none of the newly identified hrpy-regulated genes were required for bacterial aggregation; thus, neither acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing nor the rcs signal transduction system which regulates colanic acid, a molecule that plays an important role in biofilm formation in other enterobacteria, are required for d.  dadantii aggregation.

TI  == dynamic regulation of gaca in type iii secretion, pectinase gene expression, pellicle formation, and pathogenicity of dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937).
AB  == dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) secretes exoenzymes, including pectin-degrading enzymes, leading to the loss of structural integrity of plant cell walls. a type iii secretion system (t3ss) is essential for full virulence of this bacterium within plant hosts. the gacs/gaca two-component signal transduction system participates in important biological roles in several gram-negative bacteria. in this study, a gaca deletion mutant (ech137) of d. dadantii was constructed to investigate the effect of this mutation on pathogenesis and other phenotypes. compared with wild-type d. dadantii, ech137 had a delayed biofilm-pellicle formation. the production of pectate lyase (pel),  protease, and cellulase was diminished in ech137 compared with the wild-type cells. reduced transcription of two endo-pel genes, peld and pell, was found in ech137 using a green fluorescence protein-based fluorescence-activated cell sorter promoter activity assay. in addition, the transcription of t3ss genes dspe (an effector), hrpa (a structural protein of the t3ss pilus), and hrpn (a t3ss harpin) was reduced in ech137. a lower amount of rsmb regulatory rna was found in gaca mutant ech137 compared with the wild-type bacterium by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. compared with wild-type d. dadantii, a lower amount of hrpl mrna was observed in ech137 at 12 h grown in medium. although the role of rsma, rsmb, and rsmc in d. dadantii is not clear, from the regulatory pathway revealed in e. carotovora, the lower expression of dspe, hrpa, and hrpn in ech137 may be due to a post-transcriptional regulation of hrpl through the gac-rsm regulatory pathway. consequently, the reduced exoenzyme  production and pel gene expression in the mutant may be sue partially to the regulatory role of rsmb-rsma on exoenzyme expression. similar to in vitro results, a lower expression of t3ss and pectinase genes of ech137 also was observed in bacterial cells inoculated into saintpaulia ionantha leaves, perhaps  accounting for the observed reduction in local maceration. interestingly, compared with the wild-type d. dadantii, although a lower concentration of ech137 was observed at day 3 and 4 postinoculation, there is no significant difference in bacterial concentration between the wild-type bacterium and ech137 in the early stage of infection. finally, the nearly abolished systemic invasion ability of ech137 suggests that gaca of d. dadantii is essential for the pathogenicity and systemic movement of the bacterium in s. ionantha.

TI  == differential regulation of two oligogalacturonate outer membrane channels, kdgn and kdgm, of dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi).
AB  == the entry of oligogalacturonates into dickeya dadantii occurs through the specific channel kdgm. the genome of the bacterium encodes a second member of this family of outer membrane proteins, kdgn. we showed that this protein is also involved in the uptake of oligogalacturonates. when kdgn was reconstituted in proteoliposomes, it formed channels with a conductance of about 450 ps at a positive potential. these channels had weak anionic selectivity. the regulation of kdgn is complex, and five genes controlling the expression of kdgn have been identified: kdgr, pecs, ompr, hns, and crp. moreover, kdgn was regulated by growth phase but only when bacteria were grown in rich medium. most of these regulators of kdgn also control kdgm expression, but some of them regulate kdgm in the opposite manner: while pecs and ompr are repressors of kdgm, they are activators of kdgn. this pattern resembles the regulation of the escherichia coli general porins ompf and ompc, but such opposite regulation of two specific outer  membrane channels has never been described before. kdgn may allow the bacteria to collect oligogalacturonates under saprophytic conditions, when virulence genes, including kdgm, are not expressed.

TI  == the phytopathogen dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi 3937) is a pathogen of the pea aphid.
AB  == dickeya dadantii (erwinia chrysanthemi) is a phytopathogenic bacterium causing soft rot diseases on many crops. the sequencing of its genome identified four genes encoding homologues of the cyt family of insecticidal toxins from bacillus  thuringiensis, which are not present in the close relative pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum. the pathogenicity of d. dadantii was tested on the pea aphid acyrthosiphon pisum, and the bacterium was shown to be highly virulent for this insect, either by septic injury or by oral infection. the lethal inoculum dose was calculated to be as low as 10 ingested bacterial cells.  a d. dadantii mutant with the four cytotoxin genes deleted showed a reduced per os virulence for a. pisum, highlighting the potential role of at least one of these genes in pathogenicity. since only one bacterial pathogen of aphids has been previously described (erwinia aphidicola), other species from the same bacterial group were tested. the pathogenic trait for aphids was shown to be widespread, albeit variable, within the phytopathogens, with no link to phylogenetic positioning in the enterobacteriaceae. previously characterized gut  symbionts from thrips (erwinia/pantoea group) were also highly pathogenic to the  aphid, whereas the potent entomopathogen photorhabdus luminescens was not. d. dadantii is not a generalist insect pathogen, since it has low pathogenicity for  three other insect species (drosophila melanogaster, sitophilus oryzae, and spodoptera littoralis). d. dadantii was one of the most virulent aphid pathogens  in our screening, and it was active on most aphid instars, except for the first one, probably due to anatomical filtering. the observed difference in virulence toward apterous and winged aphids may have an ecological impact, and this deserves specific attention in future research.
