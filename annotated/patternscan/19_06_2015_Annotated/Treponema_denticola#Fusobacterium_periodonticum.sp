TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == clinical and microbiological results following nonsurgical periodontal therapy with or without local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam.
AB  == objectives: we assessed if adjunct administration of piperacillin/tazobactam added clinical and microbiological treatment benefits. materials and methods: thirty-six subjects (mean age 52.1 years (sd +/- 10.3)) (ns by group) with chronic periodontitis were randomly enrolled receiving subgingival debridement and the local administration of piperacillin/tazobactam (test group) or debridement alone (control group). bleeding on probing (bop), probing pocket depth (ppd), and microbiological counts of 74 species were studied by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization up to month 6 after treatment. results: mean ppd changes between baseline and month 6 in the test and control groups were 1.5  and 1.8 mm, respectively (ns between groups). bop in both groups decreased from about 80 to 40 %. at 4 and 12 weeks, lower counts of the following bacteria were  found in the test group (site level): fusobacterium species, parvimonas micra, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and a composite load of nine pathogens (p < 0.001). at week 26, subjects receiving local antibiotics had a lower prevalence at tested sites for fusobacterium nucleatum sp. polymorphum, fusobacterium periodonticum, p. micra, and t. denticola. conclusions: at 26 weeks, treatment with or without piperacillin/tazobactam resulted in similar bop and ppd improvements. at week 26  and at the subject level, the prevalence of 4/74 pathogens was found at lower counts in the group receiving local antibiotics. clinical relevance: administration of piperacillin/tazobactam reduces the prevalence of fusobacterium, p. micra, and t. denticola to a greater extent than debridement alone but with no short-term differences in ppd or bop.

TI  == [expression of cytokines in dentogingival sulcus in patients after dental implantation and during development of peri-implantitis].
AB  == aim: determination of cytokine content in various areas of dentition in patients  with peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of i and ii order. materials and methods: 32 patients with complications that developed in 3 months to 14 years after installation of intraosteal dental implants were examined. content of cytokines in various areas of dentition was determined by using solid phase enzyme immunoassay in patients with developed peri-implantitis associated with parodontopathogenic bacteria species of i and ii order. multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used for determination of parodontopathogenic bacteria marker dna. results: marker dna of i order parodontopathogenic bacteria - aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia (bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis in peri-implantation tissues during implant rejection was detected with 34.4 - 75% frequency while ii order (prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, parvimonas micros (peptostreptococcus micros), fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum etc.) - with significantly lower frequency. total concentration of il- 1beta, il-4, il-6, il-8, tnfalpha, il- 17a and infgamma in contents of pathological pocket in the area of implants and the levels of each of them were significantly higher than in the contents of parodontal pockets, areas  with stable implants and gingival fluid from areas with healthy teeth. total interleukin content in the contents of pathological pockets in the area of rejected implants was significantly higher than in other studied areas. in the exudate of parodontal pockets of the preserved teeth it was 2.4 times lower, in the area of stable implants - 4.6 times lower, and in the areas with healthy teeth - 4.8 times lower than with rejected implants (p<0.05). conclusion: the results of the study conducted allow to make a conclusion regard- ing reasonability of monitoring during dental implantation of parodontopathogenic microorganism strains and local cytokine response of the host organism with the objective of rational prophylaxis and therapy of inflammatory complications.

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == effect of smoking on subgingival microflora of patients with periodontitis in japan.
AB  == background: smoking is a risk factor for periodontitis. to clarify the contribution of smoking to periodontitis, it is essential to assess the relationship between smoking and the subgingival microflora. the aim of this study was to gain an insight into the influence of smoking on the microflora of japanese patients with periodontitis. methods: sixty-seven japanese patients with chronic periodontitis (19 to 83 years old, 23 women and 44 men) were enrolled in  the present study. they consisted of 30 smokers and 37 non-smokers. periodontal parameters including probing pocket depth (ppd) and bleeding on probing (bop) and oral hygiene status were recorded. detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum, treponema denticola  and campylobacter rectus in subgingival plaque samples was performed by polymerase chain reaction. association between the detection of periodontopathic  bacteria and smoking status was analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis and chi-square test. results: a statistically significant association was found between having a ppd >/= 4 mm and detection of t. denticola, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, or c. rectus, with odds ratios ranging from 2.17 to 3.54. a significant association was noted between bop and the detection of c. rectus or p. intermedia, and smoking, with odds ratios ranging from 1.99 to 5.62. prevalence of c. rectus was higher in smokers than non-smokers, whereas that of a. actinomycetemcomitans was lower in smokers. conclusions: within limits, the analysis of the subgingival microbial flora in smokers and non-smokers with chronic periodontitis suggests a relevant association between smoking and colonization by the specific periodontal pathogens including c. rectus.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in japanese children and their mothers.
AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. material and methods: seventy-eight japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years,  and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. results: the detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. we found  a high consistency in colonization by p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. the average number  of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring fusobacterium nucleatum and/or fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, campylobacter rectus and t. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. conclusion: periodontal bacterial colonization in japanese children increased with age and was associated with f. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.

TI  == comparison of bacterial plaque samples from titanium implant and tooth surfaces by different methods.
AB  == studies have shown similarities in the microflora between titanium implants or tooth sites when samples are taken by gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) sampling methods. the purpose of the present study was to study the microflora from curette and gcf samples using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method to assess the microflora of patients who had at least one oral osseo-integrated implant and who were otherwise dentate. plaque samples were taken from tooth/implant surfaces and from sulcular gingival surfaces with curettes, and from gingival fluid using filter papers. a total of 28 subjects (11 females) were enrolled in the study. the mean age of the subjects was 64.1 years (sd+/-4.7). on average, the implants studied had been in function for 3.7 years (sd+/-2.9). the  proportion of streptococcus oralis (p<0.02) and fusobacterium periodonticum (p<0.02) was significantly higher at tooth sites (curette samples). the gcf samples yielded higher proportions for 28/40 species studies (p-values varying between 0.05 and 0.001). the proportions of tannerella forsythia (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola were both higher in gcf samples (p<0.02 and p<0.05, respectively) than in curette samples (implant sites). the microbial  composition in gingival fluid from samples taken at implant sites differed partly from that of curette samples taken from implant surfaces or from sulcular soft tissues, providing higher counts for most bacteria studied at implant surfaces, but with the exception of porphyromonas gingivalis. a combination of gcf and curette sampling methods might be the most representative sample method.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == intergeneric coaggregation of oral treponema spp. with fusobacterium spp. and intrageneric coaggregation among fusobacterium spp.
AB  == a total of 22 strains of treponema spp. including members of all four named human oral species were tested for coaggregation with 7 strains of oral fusobacteria, 2 strains of nonoral fusobacteria, and 45 strains of other oral bacteria, which included actinobacilli, actinomyces, capnocytophagae, eubacteria, porphyromonads, prevotellae, selenomonads, streptococci, and veillonellae. none of the treponemes coaggregated with any of the latter 45 oral strains or with the two nonoral fusobacteria. all treponemes, eight treponema denticola strains, eight t. socranskii strains, four oral pectinolytic treponemes, one t. pectinovorum strain, and one t. vincentii strain coaggregated with at least one strain of the  fusobacteria tested as partners. the partners consisted of one strain of fusobacterium periodonticum, five f. nucleatum strains including all four subspecies of f. nucleatum, and a strain of f. simiae obtained from the dental plaque of a monkey. in the more than 100 coaggregations observed, the fusobacterial partner was heat inactivated (85 degrees c for 30 min), while the treponemes were unaffected by the heat treatment. furthermore, the fusobacteria were usually inactivated by proteinase k treatment, and the treponemes were not affected. only the t. denticola coaggregations were inhibited by lactose and d-galactosamine. none were inhibited by any of 23 other different sugars or l-arginine. intragenic coaggregations were seen among the subspecies of f. nucleatum and with f. periodonticum, and none were inhibited by any of the sugars tested or by l-arginine. no intrageneric coaggregations were observed among the treponemes. these data indicate that the human oral treponemes show a specificity for oral fusobacteria as coaggregation partners. such cell-to cell contact may facilitate efficient metabolic communication and enhance the proliferation of each cell in the progressively more severe stages of periodontal disease.
