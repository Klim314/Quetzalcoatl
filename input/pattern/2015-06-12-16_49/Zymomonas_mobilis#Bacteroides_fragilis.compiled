TI  - Sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid from Flavobacterium sp. KP1, a psychrophilic bacterium.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid found at high copy number was isolated from Flavobacterium sp.  KP1, a psychrophilic Gram-negative bacterium, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence will appear in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number AB007196. The pFL1 plasmid is 2311 nucleotides in length with 32.7% GC content, and shows a distinctive nucleotide sequence without homology to other plasmids of similar length. The plasmid contains two open reading frames of significant length, ORFI and ORFII. ORFI encodes a protein similar to the replication proteins found in Gram-negative bacterial plasmids, Bacteroides fragilis plasmid pBI143 and Zymomonas mobilis plasmid pZM2. The putative translation product of ORFII shows homologies with plasmid recombination proteins found mainly in Gram-positive bacterial plasmids such as Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence determination and genetic analysis of the Bacteroides plasmid, pBI143.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence and genetic organization of the Bacteroides plasmid pBI143 were determined. The plasmid was 2747 base pairs (bp) and had a G+C content of 41% (GenBank Accession No. U30316). There were two open reading frames greater than 50 codons and these were designated mobA and repA. A 56-bp inverted repeat divided pBI143 into modules with repA and mobA in separate regions. There was a marked difference in the G+C content and codon usage for the two regions; repA had 33% G+C and mobA was 44% G+C. MobA had homology to other Bacteroides mobilization proteins and RepA shared homology to a replication protein from Zymomonas mobilis plasmid pZM2. These two putative replication proteins formed a subgroup of the rolling-circle replication.proteins belonging to the pSN2 family of gram-positive plasmids. Consistent with this finding, single-stranded pBI143 DNA was detected in plasmid containing Bacteroides fragilis cultures. Availability of the pBI143 sequence allowed the elucidation of the complete nucleotide sequence for pFD288 an 8.9-kb Bacteroides shuttle vector (GenBank Accession No. U30830).
