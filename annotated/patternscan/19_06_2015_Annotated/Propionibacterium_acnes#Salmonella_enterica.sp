TI  == efficacy of an anaerobic swab transport system to maintain aerobic and anaerobic  microorganism viability after storage at -80 degrees c.
AB  == an amies agar gel swab transport system was evaluated for its ability to maintain bacterial viability and relative quantity after freezing at -80 degrees c. nine american type culture collection (atcc) bacterial strains were used: 3 anaerobic  strains (propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and clostridium  sporogenes) and 6 facultative or strict aerobic bacterial strains (stenotrophomonas maltophilia, escherichia coli ([atcc 25922 and atcc 11775], salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus saprophyticus, and lactobacillus casei). the bacterial species were chosen because they corresponded to bacteria identified in psittacine feces and cloacal  samples. there were no significant differences between growth scores at baseline  and after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days for any of the bacteria examined after 48 and 72 hr of incubation, with the exception of p. anaerobius. for p. anaerobius, there was a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the growth score after storage at -80 degrees c for 40 days from that of the baseline; however, the bacteria were still viable. the tested swab transport system may be useful when lengthy storage and transport times necessitate freezing samples prior to culture.

TI  == a pivotal role for cd40-mediated il-6 production by dendritic cells during il-17  induction in vivo.
AB  == the costimulatory requirements for th17 development remain to be defined. in this study, we show that cd40-deficient animals immunized with the gram-positive bacterium propionibacterium acnes were specifically impaired in their ability to  mount an il-17 response, but not that of ifn-gamma. the same cytokine imbalance resulted from in vivo priming with pathogen-pulsed, cd40-deficient dendritic cells (dc). engagement of cd40 on p. acnes-conditioned dc stimulated the release  of il-12, il-23, and il-6, of which il-6 alone proved essential for th17 differentiation. compared with wild-type dc, priming with those lacking expression of cd40 resulted in reduced disease severity during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, coincident with reduced il-17 production. our data  delineate sequential requirements for dc expression of cd40 and production of il-6 during th17 polarization in vitro and in vivo, and reveal distinct costimulatory requirements for th1 vs th17 generation.

TI  == beneficial or deleterious effects of a preexisting hypersensitivity to bacterial  components on the course and outcome of infection.
AB  == priming with heat-killed propionibacterium acnes enhances the sensitivity of mice to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and other biologically active bacterial components. we show that p. acnes priming has protective and deleterious effects on a subsequent serovar typhimurium infection. it may result in a complete protection  or prolonged survival, or it may accelerate mortality of the infected mice, depending on the number of serovar typhimurium bacteria administered and on the degree of lps hypersensitivity at the time of infection. both effects of p. acnes-induced hypersensitivity are mediated by gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and are based on a differential activation of the innate immune mechanisms which recognize and react against the lps present in infecting bacteria. in p. acnes-primed mice null for lps-binding protein (lbp(-/-) mice), the impaired lps  recognition, due to the absence of lbp, resulted in a higher resistance to serovar typhimurium infection. a similar p. acnes priming of mice had a protective, but no deleterious effect on a subsequent l. monocytogenes infection. this effect was ifn-gamma dependent but independent of lbp.

TI  == tnf-alpha hyper-responses to gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria in propionibacterium acnes primed or salmonella typhimurium infected mice.
AB  == ifn-gamma-dependent hypersensitivity to lps is inducible in mice by infection or  pre-treatment with killed bacteria. hypersensitive mice exhibit enhanced inflammatory responses to lps, including the overproduction of tnf-alpha. using lps(n) balb/c and lps(d) balb/c/l mice, primed with propionibacterium acnes or infected with salmonella typhimurium, we show that concurrently to hypersensitivity to lps, a hypersensitivity to other constituents of killed gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria and to staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) develops. the tnf-alpha hyper-responses in sensitized mice induced by different gram-positive bacteria, are generally weaker than those by gram-negative bacteria and vary significantly, due to the absence of a common, lps-equivalent component. using ifn-gamma r(-/-) and the respective wild-type mice, we demonstrate that although sensitization to lps and killed listeria monocytogenes is exclusively ifn-gamma-dependent, an ifn-gamma-independent, moderate sensitization to certain  tnf-alpha-inducing constituents in bacteria may develop in parallel.

TI  == inherited il-12 unresponsiveness contributes to the high lps resistance of the lps(d) c57bl/10sccr mouse.
AB  == lps(d) mouse strains are characterized by the presence of a defective lps/tlr4 gene that make them refractory to the biological activity of lps. one of the mouse strains commonly used to study lps defects is the c57bl/10sccr (cr) strain. however, unlike other lps(d) strains, the cr strain also has a heavily impaired ifn-gamma response to micro-organisms. as a consequence, unlike other lps(d) mouse strains, they do not acquire a partial lps susceptibility when treated with sensitizing bacteria. because il-12 is important for the microbial induction of ifn-gamma, we investigated whether the production or function of il-12 might be defective in cr mice. il-12 mrna (p35 and p40) was present in the spleen of untreated cr mice, il-12p40 mrna was inducible in mice injected with live or killed salmonella typhimurium, and il-12 (p70) was inducible in macrophages by bacteria. thus, cr mice exhibit normal il-12 responses. in functional tests, splenocytes of untreated or of s. typhimurium-infected mice failed to produce ifn-gamma when stimulated with murine ril-12 or with a combination of il-12 and murine ril-18 or con a. furthermore, cr mice were identical with il-12p35/p40 and il-12 receptor beta(1) knockout mice in their impaired in vivo and in vitro ifn-gamma responses to bacteria. thus, cr mice carry a second genetic defect unrelated to the lps/tlr4 mutation that underlies the il-12 unresponsiveness and  contributes to the lps resistance and impaired innate immune response in this strain.

TI  == [antimutagenic action of bacteria on mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide in salmonella typhimurium].
AB  == it is shown that in the presence of culture liquid and cells of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum, p. thoenii, p. coccoides, p. acnes, lactobacillus delbrueckii, streptococcus thermophilus, str. faecalis, bifidobacterium bifidum,  and escherichia coli ab 1157 the mutagenicity of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-nqo) in salmonella typhimurium ta 100 decreases significantly. the highest antimutagenic (desmutagenic) activity was found in culture liquid from all strains tested in the logarithmic growth phase; on aging of the cultures their antimutagenic activity decreased. the cells passaged in the medium containing 4-nqo demonstrate a higher antimutagenic activity than the control cells, and this effect is not related to the cell mutation. young cultures of all studied propionic bacteria and of str. faecalis release thiol compounds into medium. thiol accumulation in culture liquid from p. shermanii between 10 and 24 h was accompanied by culture transition to the active growth. over 24 h thiol content decreased. the maximal thiol accumulation by 24 h coincided with the maximal desmutagenic activity of the culture. it is suggested that desmutagenesis of the  bacteria studied towards 4-nqo is connected with their production of reducing (possibly, sulfur-containing) compounds that inactivate electrophilic groups of the mutagen.

TI  == herpes simplex virus type 1 replication and il-1 beta gene expression in mouse peritoneal macrophages activated in vivo by an attenuated salmonella typhimurium  vaccine or corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == activated macrophages (m phi) from mice given salmonella typhimurium or corynebacterium parvum were compared with resident peritoneal macrophages at the  molecular level for permissiveness for herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) replication and for expression of interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta). peritoneal macrophages were harvested from mice injected 7 days previously with live, avirulent s. typhimurium (sal-pm phi) or heat-killed c. parvum (cp-pm phi) and infected with hsv-1 in vitro. both sal-pm phi and cp-pm phi were activated as evidenced by characteristic changes in an ectoenzyme, by increased permissiveness for infectious virus production and viral cytopathic effect, and by induction of  il-1 beta mrna. analysis at the molecular level revealed that both types of activated m phi demonstrated increased patterns of hsv-1 immediate-early gene expression and viral dna replication as compared with resident cells. a novel finding was that viral infection reduced il-1 beta mrna in both types of activated m beta. this observation has implications for the efficacy of salmonella vaccines given in proximity to hsv-1 infection and for potential deleterious effects of hsv-1 infection in immunosuppressed patients receiving immunotherapy.

TI  == contribution of complement-stimulated hepatic macrophages and neutrophils to endotoxin-induced liver injury in rats.
AB  == the role of complement as potential activator for tissue macrophages and neutrophils was investigated in an experimental model of endotoxin-induced liver  injury in male fischer rats. injection of salmonella enteritidis endotoxin (1 mg/kg) into corynebacterium parvum-pretreated animals (7 mg/kg; single dose 6 days before endotoxin) resulted in severe oxidant stress, as indicated by a 37-fold increase of plasma levels of glutathione disulfide (basal concentration,  0.36 +/- 14 mumol/l), accumulation of neutrophils in the liver (600 +/- 31 neutrophils/50 high-power fields) and liver injury (plasma alt, 1184 +/- 185 u/l; necrosis; 19% +/- 3%) 10 hr after endotoxin. the oxidant stress induced by 1 mg/kg endotoxin in the c. parvum-treated animals was always significantly higher  than that in control animals receiving the same dose of endotoxin. inhibition of  complement activation with the soluble complement receptor type 1 attenuated the  oxidant stress and liver injury by 50% to 65% but had no effect on hepatic neutrophil accumulation or plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels. treatment with a monoclonal antibody directed against the alpha-chain of cd11b/cd18 adhesion proteins (clone 17), which was highly effective in attenuating ischemia-reperfusion injury in the liver by reducing the number of neutrophils and functionally inactivating these cells, neither protected against parenchymal  cell injury nor affected hepatic neutrophil infiltration in the c. parvum model.  we conclude that reactive oxygen derived from complement-stimulated macrophages is critical for the development of liver injury in the c. parvum/endotoxin model.

TI  == induced hyporesponsiveness in rat kupffer cells is not specific for lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == the phenomenon of lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced hyporesponsiveness has been reported to occur in macrophage cell lines and primary cells. hyporesponsiveness  was evidenced by a diminution or lack of production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) after sequential doses of lps. in order to characterize  the hyporesponsive state in kupffer cells, the production of tnf-alpha was quantified after varying the concentration of a primary low dose of lps prior to  a challenge with a high, normally stimulatory dose of lps. the kinetics of establishment of the hyporesponsive state and the effect of varying the bacterial serotype and genus of the challenge dose were determined. the specificity of the  hyporesponsive state for lps was examined. our results demonstrate that complete  hyporesponsiveness with no detectable production of tnf-alpha (< 30 pg/ml) was achieved after a primary dose > or = 10 ng/ml. establishment of the hyporesponsive state took place within 6 hr. induction of hyporesponsiveness was  not dependent upon the serotype or genus of the challenge dose of lps and was not specific for lps. complete hyporesponsiveness was induced after a primary dose (10 micrograms/ml) of the gram-positive bacterium corynebacterium parvum (cp) and was evident upon challenge with 100 micrograms/ml cp. the data indicate that the  mechanisms by which lps and cp induce hyporesponsiveness are not identical in that a primary dose of lps (10 ng/ml) induced only partial hyporesponsiveness upon challenge with cp (100 micrograms/ml). these studies improve our understanding of kupffer cell function.

TI  == the modulation of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 alpha and glucose levels with gmdp and other analogues of muramyl dipeptide.
AB  == immunomodulatory agent muramyl dipeptide (mdp) and seven of its analogues were tested for ability to counteract the toxic actions of lipopolysaccharide (lps) in experimental mouse models. female balb/c mice were presensitized with corynebacterium parvum (p. acnes) and given mdp or equimolar doses of one of its  analogues after 2 weeks, followed by intravenous challenge with lps 18 h later. this treatment produced a sharp increase in blood cytokine (tnf-alpha, il-1 alpha) levels 4 h after lps administration followed by a decline to control values after 6 h. four analogues, gmdp, threonylmdp, gmdpbenz and gmdpobut, were  able to reduce the level of cytokines induced with lps. for most of the analogues, the higher doses reduced the levels of tnf-alpha but slightly increased the concomitant il-1 alpha levels. gmdp was the most effective compound tested in terms of reduction of tnf-alpha and il-1 alpha levels, as well as for reduction of the hypoglycaemia caused by the administration of lps.

TI  == antimutagenicity of propionic acid bacteria.
AB  == the antimutagenic effect of dialysed cell extracts of 4 strains of propionic acid bacteria was examined against the mutagenicity of sodium azide in the ta1535 tester strain of salmonella typhimurium using the ames test. it was noted that dialysates of 2 strains of propionibacterium shermanii, p. pentosaceum and p. acnes, significantly reduced sodium azide-induced revertants. the dialysate of propionic acid cocci did not show an antimutagenic effect. the inhibitory activity was enhanced if the mutagen and extract were coincubated for 20 min prior to performing the mutagenicity assay. antimutagenicity of dialysates from p. shermanii vkm-103 against mnng and 9-aminoacridine was shown in s. typhimurium strains ta1535 and ta97. the antimutagenic activity was found in the protein fraction of the cell extract of p. shermanii. the proteins of the dialysate of p. shermanii were separated using a toyopearl gel column into 3 main peaks according to their molecular weights. the antimutagenic activity towards sodium azide was found in the second and the third peaks. we suggest that dialysates of the cells  of propionic acid bacteria contain several kinds of antimutagenic substances with different molecular weights.

TI  == gamma interferon production in endotoxin-responder and -nonresponder mice during  infection.
AB  == the production of gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) in response to infection and to a  number of other agents was compared in lpsn (c3h/hen and c57bl/10scsn) and lpsd (c3h/hej and c57bl/10sccr) mouse strains. large differences in ifn-gamma production were observed between c57bl/10sccr mice and the other mouse strains. with the exception of c57bl/10sccr, all mouse strains, including c3h/hej, exhibited transient levels of ifn-gamma during infection with salmonella typhimurium. spleen cells of these mice, explanted on day 3 of infection, produced in vitro ifn-gamma spontaneously; this production was enhanced considerably by heat-killed s. typhimurium, heat-killed propionibacterium acnes,  concanavalin a (cona), or lipopolysaccharide (lps). these stimuli, except for lps, also induced ifn-gamma production in cultures of normal spleen cells from noninfected animals. in contrast, c57bl/10sccr mice produced no ifn-gamma following infection with s. typhimurium. also, spleen cells of these mice, explanted on day 3 of infection, exhibited no spontaneous ifn-gamma production. a marginal response was obtained by additional stimulation of the cells with killed s. typhimurium, and a moderate response was obtained with cona. normal spleen cells from noninfected c57bl/10sccr mice showed no ifn-gamma response to killed s. typhimurium, killed p. acnes, or lps and only a low response to cona. impaired ifn-gamma production in c57bl/10sccr mice was also evident during infection with  plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi, with which a low ifn-gamma response was seen only occasionally. also, spleen cells from infected animals (days 2 to 8 after infection) exhibited only a very low level of ifn-gamma production in vitro; however, this production could be enhanced further by cona. in comparison, c57bl/10scsn mice infected with p. chabaudi chabaudi produced significant amounts of ifn-gamma. spleen cells explanted from infected animals produced ifn-gamma spontaneously in vitro; this production was enhanced further by killed p. acnes and cona. the results showed that in addition to the defect in lps responsiveness, c57bl/10sccr mice possess a defect in ifn-gamma production in response to different stimuli. during infection, ifn-gamma production and sensitization to lps occurred in parallel. infected lpsn mice exhibited enhanced  sensitivity and infected lpsd c3h/hej mice exhibited reasonable sensitivity to the lethal effects of lps. lpsd c57bl/10sccr mice remained resistant to lps when  infected with s. typhimurium and exhibited only marginal sensitivity when infected with p. chabaudi chabaudi.

TI  == suppression of resistance to salmonella typhimurium in young chickens inoculated  with corynebacterium parvum.
AB  == the effect of corynebacterium parvum on resistance to salmonella typhimurium infection was evaluated in young chickens. one-day-old chickens were inoculated subcutaneously (sc) or intraperitoneally (ip) with 1.4 mg killed c. parvum and challenged by ip injection with 5.0 x 10(7) s. typhimurium 4 days later. spleen and bursa of fabricius weights were not altered in the c. parvum-inoculated chickens. a transient increase in thymus weight occurred 3 days after inoculation with c. parvum. phytohemagglutinin-elicited cutaneous hypersensitivity was significantly suppressed in the c. parvum-inoculated chickens. morbidity due to salmonella infection increased significantly from 15% and 21% in the control groups to 43% and 46% in the chickens inoculated ip or sc with c. parvum. the results indicated that inoculation of 1-day-old chickens with c. parvum suppressed cell-mediated immune responsiveness and decreased resistance to peritoneal infection with s. typhimurium.

TI  == effect of endotoxin on release of reactive oxygen intermediates by rat hepatic macrophages.
AB  == reactive oxygen intermediates released by activated hepatic macrophages have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a rat model of liver injury induced by sequential administration of corynebacterium parvum and endotoxin. in this model, c. parvum causes extensive infiltration of the liver with activated macrophages,  but severe liver injury occurs only after subsequent exposure to endotoxin. we have therefore investigated the effects of endotoxin on the release of reactive oxygen intermediates by c. parvum-activated hepatic macrophages. after in vitro exposure to zymosan, opsonized zymosan, or phorbol myristate acetate, hepatic macrophages isolated from c. parvum- and endotoxin-treated rats demonstrated significantly (1.5-2-fold) increased release of superoxide and oxidation of [1-14c]glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt compared with hepatic macrophages isolated from c. parvum- and saline-treated control rats. these results indicate that endotoxin enhances the state of activation of hepatic macrophages already partially activated by c. parvum. we suggest that the increased release of reactive oxygen intermediates by these cells promotes liver  injury in this model.

TI  == natural production and release of tumour necrosis factor.
AB  == tumour necrosis factor (tnf) was first described as an oncolytic factor found in  sera of animals injected (primed) with reticuloendothelial stimulators and subsequently (days later) given lipopolysaccharide (lps). tnf is not found in the serum of 'primed' animals but can be found in animals given lps alone when sensitive assays are employed. tnf appears almost immediately upon lps injection, reaches a maximum from about 1.5-2 hours and disappears rapidly thereafter, and is almost undetectable by 4-6 hours. when such mice are injected again with lps,  they are unresponsive (tolerized) and do not produce tnf again, at least for seven days. other unrelated substances, such as muramyl dipeptide, viruses and mitogens, also induce tnf production. a high percentage of patients with some parasitic infections (but not cancers) demonstrate low levels of tnf in their sera; thus, they do not seem to be tolerized but produce it continuously. tnf can also be produced in macrophage cultures by treatment with lps, muramyl dipeptide  and other substances. again, it appears almost immediately and synthesis is maintained for about 8-12 hours. synthesis is dependent upon the continuous presence of lps. after synthesis stops it cannot be reinitiated by adding more lps; thus, the macrophages also appear to be tolerized. macrophage cell lines eventually become sensitive again after cultivation in lps-free conditions. synthesis of tnf is inhibited by actinomycin d or cycloheximide, indicating that  it is an inducible protein. its production is also inhibited by glucocorticoids and prostaglandin e2, indicating that these substances play important roles in the regulation of tnf synthesis.

TI  == biological activity of pityrosporum. ii. antitumor and immune stimulating effect  of pityrosporum in mice.
AB  == the antitumor activity of pityrosporum (p. orbiculare, p. ovale, p. pachydermatis, and pityrosporum sp.) on ehrlich ascites carcinomas (eacs) implanted into outbred icr mice was studied. pityrosporum significantly prolonged the survival of mice, regardless of the administration mode. in the case of p. orbiculare, the maximum survival time was 32.3 days on the mean and was obtained  by injection ip of 1 mg (dry weight) p. orbiculare for 7 consecutive days following inoculation of the tumor cells. in contrast, the mean survival time of  the nontreated mice was 14.9 days. for the investigation of the mechanisms of this antitumor activity, an examination was done on the ability of intracellular  killing of salmonella typhimurium and oxygen intermediate release by pityrosporum, as elicited by mouse peritoneal exudate cells (pec) or mouse peritoneal macrophages (pm). with about 40-minute incubation, 60-80% of s. typhimurium phagocytized by pityrosporum elicited pec or pm or were killed. the amounts of superoxide released from pityrosporum-elicited cells were 1.5 times higher than those of p. acnes-elicited ones. furthermore, three serum proteins (la, lb, and lc), which closely related to the anti-tumor activity of immunomodulators, increased in the mice given pityrosporum. these results indicated that the better survival rate seen in the case of pityrosporum administration to mice with an implanted eac may relate to the potent activation  of phagocytes and to the increase in serum proteins la, lb, and lc.

TI  == phagocytosis and killing of salmonella typhimurium by peritoneal exudate cells.

TI  == phagocytic and chemiluminescent responses of mouse peritoneal macrophages to living and killed salmonella typhimurium and other bacteria.
AB  == in the presence of luminol, resident as well as thioglycolate-induced and immunized macrophages emitted chemiluminescence more efficiently when the cells were exposed to living salmonella typhimurium than when they were exposed to the  same bacterium killed by ultraviolet light or heat. this phenomenon was observed  whether or not the bacterium was opsonized. the different response to living and  killed bacteria was also found with escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus morganii, and enterobacter aerogenes, but not with shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, and propionibacterium acnes. the results suggest that macrophages respond better to living, motile bacteria than to nonmotile or killed bacteria. the experimental results obtained with motility mutants of s. typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa confirm that macrophages exposed to the motile bacteria emit chemiluminescence more efficiently and ingest the motile bacteria at a much faster rate than the nonmotile bacteria.

TI  == a comparison of pyrogenicity and related properties seen in a suspension of corynebacterium parvum and a gramnegative organism.
AB  == when the pyrogenic properties of c. parvum and a gramnegative organism, s. typhimurium, were compared it was found that the onset of the pyrogenic response  to c. parvum was delayed relative to that of s. typhimurium and that secondary responses rarely occurred. in further experiments the interaction of c. parvum and s. typhimurium was studied. although synergism was not demonstrated, the kinetics of the response to mixtures of the two vaccines was anomalous while pre-treatment of rabbits with c. parvum resulted in the elimination of the secondary pyrogenic response to s. typhimurium suspension. the implications of these results are discussed in terms of the known characteristics of endogenous pyrogen, lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan.
