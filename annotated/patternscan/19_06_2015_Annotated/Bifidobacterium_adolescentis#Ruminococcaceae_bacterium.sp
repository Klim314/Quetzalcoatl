TI  == in vitro characterization of the impact of selected dietary fibers on fecal microbiota composition and short chain fatty acid production.
AB  == the effects of six dietary fibers [pectin, guar gum, inulin, arabinoxylan, beta-glucan, and resistant starch] on the human fecal microbiota during in vitro  fermentation were determined. bifidobacterium increased almost 25% on pectin compared with the control; a significant increase in bifidobacterium adolescentis type-2 was observed on resistant starch. bacteroides exhibited a positive correlation with propionate/short chain fatty acid (scfa) production (r = 0.59, p < 0.01), while ruminococcaceae and faecalibacterium displayed positive correlations with butyrate/scfa production (r = 0.39, 0.54, p < 0.01). a negative correlation was detected between inulin utilization and subdoligranulum (r = -0.73, p </= 0.01), while strong positive relationships were found between beta-glucan utilization and firmicutes (r = 0.73, p </= 0.01) and resistant starch utilization and blautia wexlerae (r = 0.82, p < 0.01). dietary fibers have specific and unique impacts on intestinal microbiota composition and metabolism.  these findings provide a rationale for the development of functional ingredients  targeted towards a targeted modulation of the gut microbiota.
