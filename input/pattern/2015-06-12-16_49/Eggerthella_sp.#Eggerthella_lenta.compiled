TI  - Dynamics and diversity of the 'Atopobium cluster' in the human faecal microbiota, and phenotypic characterization of 'Atopobium cluster' isolates.
AB  - This study monitored the dynamics and diversity of the human faecal 'Atopobium cluster' over a 3-month period using a polyphasic approach. Fresh faecal samples were collected fortnightly from 13 healthy donors (six males and seven females) aged between 26 and 61 years. FISH was used to enumerate total (EUB338mix) and 'Atopobium cluster' (ATO291) bacteria, with counts ranging between 1.12x10(11) and 9.95x10(11), and 1.03x10(9) and 1.16x10(11) cells (g dry weight faeces)(-1), respectively. The 'Atopobium cluster' population represented 0.2-22 % of the total bacteria, with proportions donor-dependent. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) using 'Atopobium cluster'-specific primers demonstrated faecal populations of these bacteria were relatively stable, with bands identified as Collinsella aerofaciens, Collinsella intestinalis/Collinsella stercoris, Collinsella tanakaei, Coriobacteriaceae sp. PEAV3-3, Eggerthella lenta, Gordonibacter pamelaeae, Olsenella profusa, Olsenella uli and Paraeggerthella hongkongensis in the DGGE profiles of individuals. Colony PCR was used to identify 'Atopobium cluster' bacteria isolated from faeces (n = 224 isolates). 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of isolates demonstrated Collinsella aerofaciens represented the predominant (88 % of isolates) member of the 'Atopobium cluster' found in human faeces, being found in nine individuals. Eggerthella lenta was identified in three individuals (3.6 % of isolates). Isolates of Collinsella tanakaei, an 'Enorma' sp. and representatives of novel species belonging to the 'Atopobium cluster' were also identified in the study. Phenotypic characterization of the isolates demonstrated their highly saccharolytic nature and heterogeneous phenotypic profiles, and 97 % of the isolates displayed lipase activity.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a human intestinal bacterium Eggerthella sp. CAT-1 capable of cleaving the C-ring of (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin, followed by p-dehydroxylation of the B-ring.
AB  - We isolated a human intestinal bacterium, capable of cleaving the C-ring and dehydroxylating the B-ring of both (+)-catechin (2R,3S) and (-)-epicatechin (2R,3R). Although the strain was classified as Eggerthella (Eg.) lenta [named Eg. sp. CAT-1 (JF798636)] by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene similarity, it was quite different in substrate specificity from a previously isolated strain, Eg. sp. SDG-2, which takes part in cleavage of the C-ring and dehydroxylation of the 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl moiety (B-ring) of (3R)-flavan-3-ol derivatives. On the other hand, both Eg. sp. CAT-1 and Eg. sp. SDG-2 showed the same substrate specificity against dehydroxylation of enantiomeric lignans, (+)- and (-)-dihydroxyenterodiol, and (+)- and (-)-dihydroxyenterolactone.
TI  - Enantioselective dehydroxylation of enterodiol and enterolactone precursors by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of experiments on the transformation of lignans to phytoestrogenic substances, such as enterodiol (END) and enterolactone (ENL), a previously isolated bacterium, Eubacterium (E.) sp. strain SDG-2, capable of phenolic p-dehydroxylation in the biotransformation of secoisolariciresinol diglucoside to END and ENL, was concluded to be Eggerthella (Eg.) lenta (Eg. sp. SDG-2) on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The bacterium could transform (+)-dihydroxyenterodiol (DHEND, 3a) to (+)-END (1a), but not for (-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b) under anaerobic conditions. By incubation of a mixture of (+)- and (-)-dihydroxyenterolactone (DHENL, 4a and 4b) with Eg. sp. SDG-2, only (-)-DHENL (4b) was converted to (-)-ENL (2b), selectively. On the other hand, we isolated a different bacterium, strain ARC-1, capable of dehydroxylating (-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b) from human feces. Strain ARC-1 could transform not only (-)-DHEND (3b) to (-)-END (1b), but also (+)-DHENL (4a) to (+)-ENL (2b). However, the bacterium could not transform (+)-DHEND (3a) and (-)-DHENL (4b). Both bacterial strains demonstrated different enantioselective dehydroxylation.
TI  - Occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG). However, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to SDG conversion. Therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of SDG metabolising bacteria. The data showed differences in conversion efficiency between SDG deglycosylating species, but SDG was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. The strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db showed the highest initial rate of SDG deglycosylation. Furthermore, we found that Bacteroides distasonis and B. fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. However, Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only two out of 20 faecal samples. Bacteria involved in the demethylation step of SDG conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than SDG. In particular, Peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. Finally, Eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.
TI  - Phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  - The human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) via secoisolariciresinol (SECO) to the enterolignans enterodiol (ED) and enterolactone (EL). However, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. Therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of SDG. Strains of Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain Clostridium sp. SDG-Mt85-3Db, deglycosylated SDG. Demethylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, Eubacterium callanderi, Eubacterium limosum and Peptostreptococcus productus. Dehydroxylation of SECO was catalysed by strains of Clostridium scindens and Eggerthella lenta. Finally, the newly isolated strain ED-Mt61/PYG-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ED to EL. The results indicate that the activation of SDG involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Eggerthella hongkongensis sp. nov. and eggerthella sinensis sp. nov., two novel Eggerthella species, account for half of the cases of Eggerthella bacteremia.
AB  - Eggerthella, one of the human gut flora, was rarely reported to cause bacteremia  in the literature. We describe the application of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing in defining the epidemiology and clinical significance of Eggerthella bacteremia during a 4-year period. Among 55 clinically significant blood culture isolates of anaerobic Gram-positive bacilli, 5 were identified as E. lenta and 5 belonged to 2 novel Eggerthella species, proposed as E. hongkongensis and E. sinensis, respectively. The 10 patients with Eggerthella bacteremia were adults, and 9 had underlying diseases. In all cases, the source of the bacteremia was likely from endogenous flora. Septic shock was a complication in 4 patients, and 3 patients died. The present study suggests that Eggerthella bacteremia is much more common than expected and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the 2 novel species account for half of the cases of Eggerthella bacteremia.
