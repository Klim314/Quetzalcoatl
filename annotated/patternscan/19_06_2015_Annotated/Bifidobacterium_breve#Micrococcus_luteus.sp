TI  == enhancement of lysozyme trypsin-mediated decay of intestinal bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.
AB  == lysozyme-mediated lysis of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was studied in in vitro tests using the agar gel plate and turbidometric micrococcus luteus (lysodeikticus) procedure as a standard. suspensions of the strains bifidobacterium infantis, b. infantis liberorum, b. breve, b. longum, b. ssp, and lactobacillus acidophilus proved to be resistant to egg white lysozyme and human  milk lysozyme when incubated at 37 degrees c in concentrations of 5, 50, and 500  mg lysozyme/l, respectively, through 30 and 60 min. heat treatment at 100 degrees c for 1 h and pretreatment with ether, acetone, ascorbic acid, and hydrogen peroxide failed to incline the bacteria to the lytic effects of lysozyme. consecutive incubation of the lysozyme-pretreated bacteria with trypsin resulted  in a significantly enhanced bacteriolysis in all strains of bacteria, with the exception of b. longum. the mode of action of lysozyme and proteolytic enzymes on bifidobacteria and lactobacilli offers an explanation for the release of microbial building blocks and their colonic absorption and retention in the breast-fed baby.
