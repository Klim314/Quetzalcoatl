prevalence, species distribution and antimicrobial resistance patterns of methicillin-resistant staphylococci in lithuanian pet animals.
background: the bacterial genus staphylococcus consists of many species that causes infections in pet animals. antimicrobial resistant staphylococci cause infections that are difficult to treat and they are important from the point of one health perspective. the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus (mrs) species, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in diseased pet animals (group a) and kennel dogs (group b) in lithuania and to characterize the isolates according to their antimicrobial resistance. results: twenty-one mrs isolates were obtained from 395 clinical samples (5.3 %; ci 95 % 3.5-8.0) of group a animals. sixteen, four and one isolates were from dogs, cats and a pet rabbit, respectively. the meca gene was present in 20 isolates, whereas one isolate was positive for the mecc gene. twenty-one mrs isolates (20.0 %; ci 95 % 13.5-28.6) were obtained from the vagina of female dogs (n = 105) (group b). all isolates carried the meca gene. twelve mrs species were isolated of which s. pseudintermedius was the most common (18/42) followed by s. haemolyticus (8/42) and s. lentus (4/42). mrsa was not found. all mrs strains were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. resistance to tetracycline (16/21), clindamycin (15/21) and erythromycin (14/21) was the most common types of resistance in group a animals. three isolates also demonstrated resistance to rifampin. resistance toward gentamicin (16/21), ciprofloxacin (15/21), macrolides (15/21) and tetracycline (12/21) was the most common in kennel dogs (group b). the most common genes encoding resistance to antimicrobials (excluding beta-lactams) in isolates from group a pets were tetk (21/42), aph(3')-iiia (11/42) and aac(6')-ie-aph(2'')-ia (9/42). conclusions: a wide range of mrs species were found in pet animals in lithuania. mrsa was not found.
inhibition of exotoxin production by mobile genetic element sccmec-encoded psm-mec rna is conserved in staphylococcal species.
staphylococcal species acquire antibiotic resistance by incorporating the mobile-genetic element sccmec. we previously found that sccmec-encoded psm-mec rna suppresses exotoxin production as a regulatory rna, and the psm-mec translation product increases biofilm formation in staphylococcus aureus. here, we examined whether the regulatory role of psm-mec on host bacterial virulence properties is conserved among other staphylococcal species, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus, both of which are important causes of nosocomial infections. in s. epidermidis, introduction of psm-mec decreased the production of cytolytic toxins called phenol-soluble modulins (psms) and increased biofilm formation. introduction of psm-mec with a stop-codon mutation that did not express psm-mec protein but did express psm-mec rna also decreased psm production, but did not increase biofilm formation. thus, the psm-mec rna inhibits psm production, whereas the psm-mec protein increases biofilm formation in s. epidermidis. in s. haemolyticus, introduction of psm-mec decreased psm production, but did not affect biofilm formation. the mutated psm-mec with a stop-codon also caused the same effect. thus, the psm-mec rna also inhibits psm production in s. haemolyticus. these findings suggest that the inhibitory role of psm-mec rna on exotoxin production is conserved among staphylococcal species, although the stimulating effect of the psm-mec gene on biofilm formation is not conserved.
a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60 mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
comparison on conjunctival sac bacterial flora of the seniors with dry eye in ganzi autonomous prefecture.
aim: to compare the bacterial flora in palpebral conjunctiva of xerophthalmia seniors of tibetan, yi and han, and analyze the differences and similarities of the bacteria. methods: the test subjects were selected from 2 tibetan, 2 yi and 3 han populated places, respectively. total 222 seniors (444 eyes) with dry eye were examined. secretion was collected from the palpebral conjunctiva of the subjects and then inoculated onto a blood agar plate. after 48h of incubation, the bacteria were examined for the differences and similarities between different ethnics. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) of gram stain characterization, dominant bacteria and number of the bacterial species present in oxrophthalmia patients among tibetan, yi and han nationalities. the bacteria presented in all groups include staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa. the bacteria detected from the two of three ethnic groups were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae, and staphylococcus heads. the incidence rate of bacteria-associated dry eye in tibetan population was significantly lower than that of han and yi population. conclusion: there is no significant difference in the bacteria flora of palpebral conjunctiva observed among dry eye elder populations of tibetan, yi and han people. all of staphylococcus epidermidis, corynebacterium, micrococcus luteu, intracellular bacteria sphingomonas, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, kytococcus sedentarius, streptococcus angina, micrococcus lylae and staphylococcus heads are common bacteria flora of the three nationalities inhibiting in this area.
r-thanatin inhibits growth and biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis in vivo and in vitro.
staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most frequent causes of device-associated infections, because it is known to cause biofilms that grow on catheters or other surgical implants. the persistent increasing resistance of s. epidermidis and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) has driven the need for newer antibacterial agents with innovative therapeutic strategies. thanatin is reported to display potent antibiotic activities, especially against extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. the present study aimed to investigate whether a shorter derivative peptide (r-thanatin) could be used as a novel antibacterial agent. we found that r-thanatin was highly potent in vitro against coagulase-negative staphylococci, such as s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and s. hominis, and inhibited biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations. properties of little toxicity to human red blood cells (hrbcs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, a low incidence of resistance, and relatively high stability in plasma were confirmed. excellent in vivo protective effects were also observed using a methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse)-induced urinary tract infection rat model. electron microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy analyses suggested that r-thanatin disturbed cell division of mrse severely, which might be the reason for inhibition of mrse growth. these findings indicate that r-thanatin is active against the growth and biofilm formation of mrse in vitro and in vivo. r-thanatin might be considered as a specific drug candidate for treating cons infections.
an international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: zaaps program results for 2011.
through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and hong kong. linezolid mic90 values were 2 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the mic90 value was 1 mug/ml for coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons), beta-hemolytic streptococci, streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. all s. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/ml. three (0.3%) of 928 strains of cons had a linezolid mic of 4 mug/ml and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in l3. there were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (brazil [5], france [1], germany [2] greece [2], italy [2], ireland [1], and spain [1]) representing 5 species (e. faecium, s. capitis, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, s. lugdenensis). a mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid mic values; one was a s. haemolyticus isolate with a mic at 4 mug/ml. resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 zaaps program: cons, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among s aureus, s. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. as the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
misidentification of vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus as coagulase-negative staphylococcus.
reduced vancomycin susceptibility in staphylococcus aureus in many cases appears  to be associated with changes in biological characteristics, including reduced coagulase activity, cell wall thickening, slow growth, smaller colonies, decreased pigment formation and less or no haemolysis. whether these changes affect identification by routine methods has not been reported. in this study, 24 vancomycin-susceptibility-reduced coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) strains (including 22 staphylococcus haemolyticus strains and two staphylococcus epidermidis strains) were retested by pcr-based detection of staphylococcus aureus-specific genes (nuc, coa and 16s rrna). the results showed that six isolates identified by conventional biochemical tests as s. haemolyticus contained nuc, coa and 16s rrna genes. these six strains were serial-passaged daily on nutrient agar without vancomycin supplementation, and vancomycin-susceptible revertants were obtained after 15 continuous passages. revertant isolates were coagulase-positive and were identified as s. aureus by automated testing methods. this suggests that biochemical changes in s. aureus strains with reduced vancomycin susceptibility should be highlighted and that the detection of these strains requires more attention and improved techniques.
sensitivity of skin microflora to antibacterial medications administered to patients with different status of hiv.
the attenuation of the tolerability of hiv-infected patients to the infectious agents leads to the development of frequent relapses both primary pyoderma and secondary bacterial complications of dermatoses of unclear nature that aggravates current status of the main disease. regarding about mention data, the study of biotype spectrum of infectious agents in pustular skin lesions and their resistance patterns to antibacterial preparations in patients with pyoderma and with different hiv status is of great interest. the article presents comparative results of the study of bacterial composition in the pus of 124 patients with pyoderma and hiv infection and in 70 patients with pyoderma but without hiv. it is possible on the basis of results of the analysis to note high frequency of identification of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus haemolyticus in persons without hiv infection and both primary and secondary pyoderma with the further decrease in strains in similar patients with hiv. all patients with pustular skin lesions were found to have a wide spectrum of pathogens prevalence of which depends both on hiv-status of a patient and clinical form of pyoderma. hiv-positive patients with primary pyoderma have a frequency rate of isolation of infectious agents in mixed cultures considerably higher (10 times) than this parameter in hiv-negative patients. the same tendency is observed in the analysis of cultivation rate of pathogens in patients with secondary pyoderma. however, in hiv positive patients the cultivation rate of mixed cultures increases by 2,5 times.
activity of telavancin and comparator antimicrobial agents tested against staphylococcus spp. isolated from hospitalised patients in europe (2007-2008).
the activity of telavancin was evaluated against staphylococcus spp. collected from european hospitals as part of an international surveillance study (2007-2008). a total of 7534 staphylococcal clinical isolates [5726 staphylococcus aureus and 1808 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons)] were included. isolates were tested for susceptibility according to reference methods and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were interpreted based on clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2010 and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) 2009 criteria. telavancin breakpoints approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) were applied. telavancin activity was evaluated against meticillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) displaying several antibiogram resistance patterns, including multidrug-resistant isolates. telavancin was active against s. aureus [mic(50/90) values (mics for 50% and 90% of the isolates, respectively)=0.12/0.25mg/l; 100.0% susceptible] and cons (mic(50/90)=0.12/0.25mg/l), inhibiting all isolates at < or =0.5mg/l. similar results were observed when s. aureus were stratified by year or country of origin (mic(50/90)=0.12/0.25mg/l). when mrsa isolates were clustered according to 48 different resistance patterns, telavancin showed consistent mic(90) values (0.25mg/l) regardless of multidrug resistance. amongst cons, telavancin was slightly more active against staphylococcus capitis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus hominis, staphylococcus lugdunensis and staphylococcus xylosus (mic(50)=0.12 mg/l) compared with staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus and staphylococcus warneri (mic(50)=0.25mg/l). overall, telavancin exhibited mic(90) results two- to eight-fold lower than comparators (daptomycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and linezolid). based upon mic(90) values, telavancin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a contemporary (2007-2008) collection of staphylococcus spp. recovered from nearly 30 european medical centres.
nitazoxanide inhibits biofilm formation by staphylococcus epidermidis by blocking accumulation on surfaces.
coagulase-negative species of staphylococcus are often associated with opportunistic hospital-acquired infections that arise from the colonization of indwelling catheters. here we show that the antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide (ntz) and its active metabolite, tizoxanide (tiz), are inhibitory to the growth of staphylococcus epidermidis and other staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, under aerobic and microaerobic conditions (mics, 8 to 16 microg/ml). at sub-mic levels, ntz and tiz also inhibited biofilm production under static conditions by strains of s. epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus with a 50% inhibitory concentration of approximately 2.5 microg/ml (8 microm). the 5-nitro group was required for biological activity, and a hydrophilic derivative of ntz (amix) also inhibited biofilm formation. ntz did not disperse the existing biofilm but did block further accumulation. sub-mics of ntz had no effect on primary attachment to surfaces at either 4 or 37 degrees c. the inhibitory action of ntz and tiz, but not vancomycin, on biofilm production could be reversed by the addition of zinc salts (2.5 to 40 microm) but not other metals, suggesting that ntz might target the zinc-dependent accumulation-associated protein (aap) that mediates accumulation on surfaces. however, neither ntz nor tiz formed chelation complexes with zinc salts, based on spectrophotometric and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses, and addition of excess zinc to ntz-grown bacteria (apo-aap) did not restore the accumulation phenotype. our studies suggest that sub-mic levels of ntz may affect the assembly or function of cell structures associated with the biofilm phenotype.
vancomycin dosage optimization in patients with malignant haematological disease  by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
background: the use of vancomycin against staphylococcus aureus is currently debated because of the increasing resistance developed by this pathogen. nevertheless, antibacterial effectiveness is a limited resource that must be protected and restored. novel dosage strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses are needed to retain effectiveness that could improve drug exposure in patients infected with such pathogens. objective: the aim of this study was to assess whether standard or higher vancomycin dosages are required to increase the probability of attaining a target pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index for several staphylococcal strains and thus to estimate the minimum vancomycin daily dose related to a high probability of effective treatment in patients with malignant haematological disease. methods: monte carlo simulation was performed to calculate the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for different vancomycin daily dosages, using a population pharmacokinetic model previously defined in patients with malignant haematological disease and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distribution for vancomycin against several staphylococcal species (vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus and vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus [visa], s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus [cns] species) obtained from the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) in order to predict the dose that would achieve the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic index value associated with efficacy (the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours divided by the mic [auc(24)/mic >/=400]). results: cfr values showed dependence on the renal function of the patient and the causative pathogen. only in patients with a creatinine clearance (cl(cr)) <60 ml/min did the standard vancomycin dosage (2000 mg/day) induce cfrs >60% for all staphylococci, except the visa strains. cfrs for s. aureus of 90.6%, 47.3% and 31.2% for cl(cr) values of <60, 60-120 and >120 ml/min, respectively, were obtained, whereas for the visa strains, the corresponding values were only 14.0%, 0.3% and 0%. the impact of potential pathogens on cfrs is also significant. according to our pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis, in patients with normal renal function (cl(cr) between 60 and 120 ml/min) vancomycin 2000 mg/day leads to a risk of not achieving the recommended auc(24)/mic breakpoint of 52.7%, 70.4%, 74.9% and 80.3% for s. aureus, s. haemolyticus, cns and s. epidermidis, respectively. application of our results to clinical practice graphically allows us to obtain the recommended dose for any a priori-selected probability of attaining the auc(24)/mic ratio of >/=400 and to evaluate the cfrs for any dosing regimen used in this population group, depending on the patients' renal function. conclusions: application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis based on monte carlo simulation offers an excellent tool for selecting the therapeutic option with the highest probability of clinical success in patients with malignant haematological disease. thus, for vancomycin-susceptible s. aureus, if a cfr >/=80 is assumed as clinically acceptable, vancomycin doses of 1500, 3000 and 4000 mg/day for a cl(cr) of <60, 60-120 and >120 ml/min, respectively, will be required.
[physico-chemical properties of staphylococci of different species in resistance  to human thrombodefensins].
testing 54 strains of staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, s. warneri, s. hominis, s. capitis) revealed that s. aureus in contrast to coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) is more resistant to bactoriocidal action of human thrombodefensins (resistance index: 60.3 vs 25.6%), less hydrophilicolipophilic balance-hlb: -0.42 vs -0.64) and less charged (x-potential: -32.4 vs -35.6 mv). in groups of staphylococci (s. aureus and cns) correlation links of bacterial resistance to human thrombodefensins with their hlb and x-potential (r=-0.32...-0.36). by in vitro experiments, it was shown that 5 passages of staphylococci in meat-peptonic broth with human thrombodefensins (50 mkg protein/ml) lead to adaptation of bacteria followed by the formation of resistance to cationic peptides from thrombocytes, a decrease of hydrophobicity and x-potencial. the role of physico-chemical properties in providing thrombodefensin-resistance of staphylococci as a developmental factor of infectious-and-inflammatory process and persistence of bacteria was confirmed with salmonella infection.
comparison of the bbl chromagar staph aureus agar medium to conventional media for detection of staphylococcus aureus in respiratory samples.
screening for staphylococcus aureus has become routine in certain patient populations. this study is the first clinical evaluation of the bbl chromagar staph aureus agar (csa) medium (bd diagnostics, sparks, md.) for detection of s. aureus in nasal surveillance cultures and in respiratory samples from cystic fibrosis (cf) patients. s. aureus colonies appear mauve on csa. other organisms are inhibited or produce a distinctly different colony color. s. aureus was identified from all media by slide coagulase, exogenous dnase, and mannitol fermentation assays. susceptibility testing was performed using the agar dilution method. a total of 679 samples were evaluated. all samples were inoculated onto csa. nasal surveillance cultures were inoculated onto sheep blood agar (sba) (bd diagnostics), and samples from cf patients were inoculated onto mannitol salt agar (msa) (bd diagnostics). of the 679 samples cultured, 200 organisms produced a mauve color on csa (suspicious for s. aureus) and 180 were positive for s. aureus on sba or msa. of 200 csa-positive samples 191 were identified as s. aureus. nine mauve colonies were slide coagulase negative and were subsequently identified as staphylococcus lugdunensis (one), staphylococcus epidermidis (three), staphylococcus haemolyticus (one), and corynebacterium species (four). csa improved the ability to detect s. aureus by recovering 12 s. aureus isolates missed by conventional media. of the 192 s. aureus isolates recovered, 122 were methicillin susceptible and 70 were methicillin resistant. overall, the sensitivity and specificity of csa in this study were 99.5 and 98%, respectively. there was no difference in the performance of the slide coagulase test or in susceptibility testing performed on s. aureus recovered from csa compared to sba or msa. our data support the use of csa in place of standard culture media for detection of s. aureus in heavily contaminated respiratory samples.
[post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--i. gram-positive bacteria].
as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. changes in the bacterial susceptibility for czop were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint mic. sixteen species (2,363 strains) of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), staphylococcus haemolyticus, staphylococcus saprophyticus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (pssp), penicillin-intermediate resistant s. pneumoniae (pisp), penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp), streptococcus milleri group and peptostreptococcus spp. the antibacterial activity of czop either against mssa or msse was preferable (mic90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/ml) and comparable to those of other cephems. czop was also effective on mrse (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) but not on mrsa. czop and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against s. haemolyticus (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (cpr; mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) and higher than those of other cephems. no antibacterial activity of czop against e. faecium and e. avium was observed, like other drugs. the antibacterial activity of czop against s. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and cpr (mic90: < or = 0.063 microgram/ml), and, against s. agalactiae, was also preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml). czop indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against pssp, pisp, or prsp (mic90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against s. milleri group was also preferable, but the mic90 of czop in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. the resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint mic of czop was 95.9% in mrsa, 93.5% in prsp, 63.3% in pisp, 35.8% in s. haemolyticus, 27.9% in e. faecalis, and 13.3% mrse. those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (cfpm), but e. faecalis showed 91.2% for cfpm. the difference in the resistance ratio of e. faecalis demonstrated that czop successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. in correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of prsp was not inhibited at breakpoint mic either czop or cfpm while 69.2% at breakpoint mic either czop or ceftazidime. in conclusion, the antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. a decline in the sensitivities of s. saprophyticus, s. milleri group, pisp, and prsp to czop, however, was suggested.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. a total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus avium, and peptostreptococcus spp. czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
[yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--i. gram-positive bacteria].
the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from january to december, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa; n = 127), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 123), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), enterococcus faecium (n = 50), enterococcus avium (n = 50), and peptostreptococcus spp. (p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. micros, p. prevotii; n = 125). czop possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. the mic90 of czop against mrsa and s. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against s. pneumoniae and peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. however, the mic90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. increases in the mic90 against s. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), flomoxef (fmox), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and imipenem (ipm). increases in the mic90 against peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (caz), cpr, cfpm, fmox, sbt/cpz, and ipm. the decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual mic range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. in conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of czop against the gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. it, therefore, was suggested that czop had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
in vitro and in vivo activities of a novel cephalosporin, bms-247243, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible staphylococci.
the recent emergence of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin has intensified the search for alternative therapies for the treatment of infections caused by this organism. one approach has been to identify a beta-lactam with improved affinity for pbp 2a, the target enzyme responsible for methicillin resistance in staphylococci. bms-247243 is such a candidate, with mics that inhibit 90% of isolates tested (mic(90)s) of 4, 2, and 8 microg/ml for methicillin-resistant strains of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. haemolyticus, respectively, as determined on plates with mueller-hinton agar and 2% nacl. the bms-247243 mics for mrsa were minimally affected by the susceptibility testing conditions (inoculum size, prolonged incubation, addition of salt to the test medium) or by staphylococcal beta-lactamases. bms-247243 mic(90)s for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcal species ranged from < or = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml. the bms-247243 mic(90) for beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus strains was fourfold higher than that for beta-lactamase-nonproducing strains. bms-247243 is hydrolyzed by staphylococcal beta-lactamases at 4.5 to 26.2% of the rates measured for cephaloridine. the affinity of bms-247243 for pbp 2a was >100-fold better than that of methicillin or cefotaxime. bms-247243 is bactericidal for mrsa, killing the bacteria twice as fast as vancomycin. these in vitro activities of bms-247243 correlated with its in vivo efficacy against infections in animals, including the neutropenic murine thigh and rabbit endocarditis models involving mrsa strains. in conclusion, bms-247243 has in vitro and in vivo activities against methicillin-resistant staphylococci and thus may prove to be useful in the treatment of infections caused by these multidrug-resistant organisms.
in vitro activities of rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
rwj-54428 (mc-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. in a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), rwj-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an mic at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (mic(90)) of 2 microg/ml. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, rwj-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an mic(90) of 2 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was active against s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (rwj-54428 mic range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). rwj-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mic(90), 0.5 microg/ml). for ampicillin-susceptible enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), rwj-54428 had an mic(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. rwj-54428 was also active against enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. the potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; rwj-54428 mics ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. rwj-54428 was more active than penicillin g and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). rwj-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis (mic(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). this survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to rwj-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
[interspecies lysogenization in staphylococci: transfer of bacteriophage converting enterotoxin a from a clinical strain of staphylococcus aureus to staphylococcus intermedius].
the ability of lysogenization was examined of 50 s. intermedius strains and of 77 strains belonging to 14 different species of coagulase-negative staphylococci using 8 enterotoxin a converting bacteriophages isolated from s. aureus. all the examined bacteriophages showed lytic activity against at least 1 of 11 susceptible strains of s. intermedius to them. lytic activity towards coagulase-negative staphylococci was observed for 6 of 8 examined bacteriophages. two bacteriophages were active against 1 of 9 examined s. capitis strains, one against 1 of 11 examined s. haemolyticus strains, four against 1 of 6 examined s. lugdunensis strains, three against 1 of 6 examined s. warneri strains and one against 1 of 5 examined s. xylosus strains. lysogenization with bacteriophage f421-1 able to convert positively enterotoxin a and staphylokinase and negatively beta-haemolysin of one s. intermedius strain was successful. s. intermedius lysogenized with phi 421-1 was able to produce both enterotoxin a and staphylokinase and lost ability to produce beta-haemolysin. our results showed a broad lytic spectrum and interspecies host range of some s. aureus bacteriophages and the ability of interspecies transfer of bacteriophages between s. aureus and s. intermedius.
epidemiological study of staphylococcal colonization and cross-infection in two west african hospitals.
surveillance in two medium-size (250-300 beds) hospitals located in the most populated islands of cape verde was undertaken in july 1997 in order to obtain data concerning nasal carriage of staphylococci. nasal swabs (172) taken from inpatients and health care workers (hcw) from different internment services yielded 68 staphylococcus aureus and 105 coagulase-negative staphylococcal (cns) isolates, demonstrating extensive colonization of both inpatients and hcw by s. aureus (carriage rate 41%) and cns (carriage rate 65%). the most frequent cns species were s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. three species--s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. sciuri-were recovered from wound swabs. the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of s. aureus and cns differed sharply: all 68 s. aureus were resistant to penicillin but were fully susceptible to oxacillin as well as the other antimicrobial agents tested-gentamicin; erythromycin, except for three strains; ciprofloxacin; sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, except for two strains; vancomycin; and amoxicillin/clavulanate. in contrast, most (91/105) of cns were resistant to both penicillin and oxacillin, and a variable but substantial proportion of cns isolates also carried multiresistant traits to gentamicin, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and amoxicillin/clavulanate. the analysis by pfge of the methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and the methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis (mrse) strains provided evidence for extensive cross-infection and cross-colonization from hcw to patients.
nationwide german multicenter study on prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates and comparative in vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin.
antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria have become an increasing problem in  the last two decades. in order to evaluate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in staphylococcal bloodstream isolates in germany, 2,042 staphylococci collected in 21 tertiary-care hospitals were investigated during a 3-year period (march 1996 to march 1999). altogether, 1,448 s. aureus isolates and 594 coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) that comprised 13 different species were included. furthermore, the antistaphylococcal activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin were compared with those of eight other compounds by the broth microdilution method. the rates of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, and other cons were 13.5, 69, 90, and 34%, respectively. in oxacillin-resistant strains high rates of resistance (up to 100%) to erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin were also observed. however, no strain appeared to be resistant to vancomycin or quinupristin-dalfopristin. the streptogramin combination exhibited excellent in vitro activity against all staphylococcal species tested, regardless of the patterns of resistance to other drug classes. in terms of mics at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited, quinupristin-dalfopristin was 2 times more active against s. aureus isolates, 4 to 16 times more active against s. haemolyticus, and 8 to 32 times more active against s. epidermidis than vancomycin or teicoplanin.
combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactams are synergistic against staphylococci with reduced susceptibilities to vancomycin.
evidence of synergism between combinations of vancomycin and beta-lactam antibiotics against 59 isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus haemolyticus) for which vancomycin mics ranged from 1 to 16 microg/ml were tested by broth microdilution checkerboard, disk diffusion, agar dilution, and time-kill antimicrobial susceptibility tests. the combination of vancomycin and oxacillin demonstrated synergy by all test methods against 30 of 59 isolates; no antagonism was seen. synergy with vancomycin was also found by modified disk diffusion testing for ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not for aztreonam. evidence of synergy correlated directly with vancomycin mics. the efficacy of vancomycin given alone and in combination with nafcillin was tested in the rabbit model of experimental endocarditis caused by three clinical isolates of glycopeptide-intermediate-susceptible s. aureus (gisa) (isolates hip5827, hip5836, and mu50). two of the gisa isolates (isolates mu50 and hip5836) were extremely virulent in this model, with 27 of 42 (64%) animals dying during the 3-day trial. therapy with either vancomycin or nafcillin given as a single agent was ineffective for animals infected with hip5827 or mu50. however, the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin resulted in a mean reduction of 4.52 log10 cfu/g of aortic valvular vegetations per g compared to the reduction for controls for animals infected with hip5827 and a reduction of 4. 15 log10 cfu/g for animals infected with mu50. renal abscesses caused by hip5827 were sterilized significantly better with the combination of vancomycin and nafcillin than by either treatment alone. we conclude that the combination of vancomycin and beta-lactams with antistaphylococcal activity is an effective regimen for the treatment of infections with clinical strains of staphylococci which demonstrate reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides.
mechanisms of action of quinolones against staphylococci and relationship with their in vitro bactericidal activity.
ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin exhibited mechanism a (requires cell division as well as bacterial protein and rna synthesis to kill bacteria) and c (active against nondividing bacteria but requires protein and rna synthesis) against the reference strain staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, yet only mechanism a was exhibited by these fluoroquinolones when tested against three clinical isolates: s. aureus sa-215, staphylococcus epidermidis se-81 and staphylococcus haemolyticus sx-1. on the contrary, fleroxacin exerted mechanism a and c against the three clinical isolates but only mechanism a against the reference strain. ofloxacin displayed mechanism a against s. epidermidis se-81, mechanism a and c against s. haemolyticus and mechanism a and b (active against nondividing bacteria and does not require protein and rna synthesis) against the two s. aureus tested. sparfloxacin showed mechanism a and c against the four staphylococcus species studied, and temafloxacin was the only fluoroquinolone tested that exhibited mechanism a and b against the four bacterial strains assayed. no correlation was found between the in vitro bactericidal activity (expressed as minimum inhibitory concentration and optimal bactericidal concentration) and the mechanisms of action exhibited by these fluoroquinolones.
antimicrobial resistance in staphylococci and enterococci in 10 portuguese hospitals in 1996 and 1997. posgar. portuguese study group of antimicrobial resistance.
during a 2-year period, 10 portuguese hospitals located throughout the country studied antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinically relevant staphylococci and enterococci. of more than 12,000 staphylococcus aureus isolates tested, two main patterns were found, methicillin-sensitive organisms most of them resistant only to penicillin but a few to other antimicrobials and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) strains (prevalence 48.2%) resistant to most of the antimicrobials tested and uniformly susceptible to vancomycin. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 71% of s. epidermidis (approximately 5,000 isolates tested) and 84% s. haemolyticus (approximately 1,000 isolates tested) were also resistant to methicillin as well as most other antimicrobials except vancomycin. most of the 5,000 enterococcus faecalis isolates tested were susceptible to ampicillin and vancomycin, in contrast to 650 e. faecium isolates, 70% of which were resistant to ampicillin and 20% to vancomycin and all other antibiotics. a high prevalence of aminoglycoside resistance occurred in both enterococcus species. this survey showed that resistance profiles of staphylococci and enterococci hospital isolates have not changed in the last 5 years in portugal, with the exception of the rise in vancomycin resistance in e. faecium. the high prevalence of methicillin resistance in s. aureus and in the cns remains an issue of medical concern.
european glycopeptide susceptibility survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. european glycopeptide resistance survey study group.
in the european glycopeptide susceptibility survey 7078 gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of western europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. teicoplanin (mode mic 0.5 microgram/ml) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml) against staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). all isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (mic < or = 4 micrograms/ml) and all but four to teicoplanin (mic < or = 8 micrograms/ml); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml). with coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of mic of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/ml teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/ml (resistant). among isolates of s. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (mic 16 micrograms/ml) and 3.3% were resistant (mic > or = 32 micrograms/ml) to teicoplanin. however, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. generally, teicoplanin (mode mic < or = 0.12 microgram/ml) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode mic < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. glycopeptide-susceptible enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode mic 0.25 microgram/ml) than to vancomycin (mode mic 1 microgram/ml). combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (vana phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of enterococcus faecium than in enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. four isolates of e. faecium and four of e. faecalis expressed the vanb-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. spain was the only country not to submit resistant e. faecium strains while resistant e. faecalis isolates came only from spain and italy.
synergistic hemolytic activity of staphylococcus lugdunensis is mediated by three peptides encoded by a non-agr genetic locus.
some strains of the coagulase-negative staphylococcus lugdunensis produce a synergistic hemolytic activity (slush), phenotypically similar to the delta-hemolysin of s. aureus. reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography of supernatants from s. lugdunensis 307 yielded three late-eluting peaks of 3.5 kda with synergistic hemolytic activity. a degenerate oligonucleotide probe was designed from partial amino acid sequences of the 23-amino-acid (aa) tryptic fragments from one of the three peaks and hybridized to a single 2.8-kb hindiii chromosomal fragment. the relevant portion of this fragment was cloned by pcr, and sequencing showed the presence of three related open reading frames (orfs), slush-a, slush-b, and slush-c, preceded by an unrelated short potentially coding sequence (orf-x), cotranscribed on a polycistronic 838-nucleotide mrna. the amino acid sequences of the peptides from the three peaks align perfectly with the predicted sequences from the three slush orfs (peak i = slush-b; peak ii = slush-c; peak iii = slush-a). these three peptides are closely related (amino acid homology, >76%) and do not show significant homology to s. aureus delta-hemolysin but do resemble a salmonella typhimurium invasin and the "gonococcal growth inhibitor," a bacteriocin secreted by staphylococcus haemolyticus. the predicted orf-x gene product is a 24-aa peptide with no homology to the slush peptides.
[the taxonomic distribution, characteristic and susceptibility against antimicrobial agents of methicillin-resistant staphylococci isolated from blood].
the species, meca gene, beta-lactamase activity, the ability of slime formation and drug susceptibilities of 386 strains of staphylococci which were isolated from blood in our laboratory were studied. the coagulase typing of each strains identified as s. aureus was also determined. these 386 strains consisted of various species, e.g., s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. capitis, s. caprae, s. hominis, s. simulans, s. haemolyticus, and s. lugdunensis. meca (methicillin-resistant gene) was detected in 84 (67.7%) of 124 s. aureus and 195 (75.3%) of 259 cns, but there was no statistical difference. however meca positive rate was higher in s. epidermidis and s. caprae, lower in s. hominis compared with s. aureus, s. lugdunensis having meca has not been reported, but one of two our s. lugdunensis strains had meca. the positive rate (77.4%: 65/84) of beta-lactamase of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was lower than that (95.5%: 187/195) of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (mrcns). concerning the ability of slime formation, cns had higher positive rate, especially in case of mrcns (46.2%: 84/182) than s. aureus. on the other hand, mrcns showed a tendency to be less resistant to some antimicrobials than mrsa. especially against cephalothin (cet), the resistant rate of mrsa and mrcns were 86.9% and 5.6%, respectively. among the main species of mrcns, s. capitis and s. caprae were more resistant than s. epidermidis and s. simulans to cefaclor (ccl), cefmetazole (cmz), flomoxef (fmox) and fosfomycin (fom). hereafter, one should be careful about infectious disease caused by cns especially in immuno-compromised host, because many species of cns have higher positive rate of beta-lactamase and slime formation than s. aureus beside meca.
antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
the antimicrobial activity of cs-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. cs-940 activity against members of the family enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median mic90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against acinetobacter spp. (mic90s, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and stenotrophomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia (mic90s, 2 micrograms/ml). cs-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria spp. (mic90s, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). cs-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. cs-940 was also very active against streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which mic90s were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for enterococcus faecium, however, the mic90 was 4 micrograms/ml. cs-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. this compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.
biomaterial-associated staphylococcal peritoneal infections in a neutropaenic mouse model.
adhesion of staphylococcal cells to polyethylene with end point-attached heparin  was quantified by bioluminescence. staphylococcus epidermidis 3380 and the slime-producing s. epidermidis rp12 adhered to the highest extent, and s. lugdunensis 2342 to the least extent. preincubation of the polymer with dialysis fluid reduced adhesion of s. epidermidis 3380 and rp12 but enhanced that of s. aureus, and preadsorption of the surface with fibronectin decreased subsequent adhesion of s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus strains. when staphylococci were grown in the presence of a biomaterial their ability to activate peritoneal cells was decreased. the bactericidal activity was impaired, whereas ingestion of opsonized coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) strains was unaffected. with s. epidermidis rp12 the presence of biomaterial did not influence either phagocytosis or bactericidal effect of peritoneal cells. after intra-peritoneal challenge with staphylococcal strains, the organ uptake of s. aureus cowan 1 was increased in normal mice whereas immunosuppressed mice died. cns strains increased mainly in the peritoneal cavity of immunosuppressed mice. the uptake of bacteria in liver and kidneys was increased with s. epidermidis 3380, s. lugdunensis 2343 and s. schleiferi 667-88. generally, cns strains persisted in the peritoneal cavity of both normal and immunosuppressed mice. these data indicate that host defense mechanisms, mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils, fail to eliminate cns infections in the peritoneum, and that initial adhesion to an implanted biomaterial may be of lesser importance in the peritoneal cavity than in e.g. catheter-associated infections. there are strain-specific virulence factors of bacteria, and slime producing strains evade the host defense mechanisms more efficiently than non-slime producing strains.
comparative antimicrobial activities of the penem wy-49605 (sun5555) against recent clinical isolates from five u.s. medical centers.
the in vitro activity of wy-49605 (sun5555) (wy) was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid against 2,958 consecutive clinical isolates from five medical centers and 402 respiratory pathogens from 18 other facilities. most members of the family enterobacteriaceae were inhibited by wy (mic at which 50% of the isolates are inhibited [mic50], < or = 2.0 micrograms/ml). mic90s of > or = 8.0 micrograms/ml were observed for enterobacter cloacae, serratia spp., and proteus mirabilis. wy was the most active drug against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.12 microgram/ml) and other coagulase-negative staphylococci (mic90, 4.0 micrograms/ml). the four drugs were not active against nonenteric gram-negative bacilli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. at 2.0 micrograms/ml, wy inhibited 82% of enterococcus faecalis strains and was equal to or superior to the other drugs against streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis.
optimizing testing of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus species.
selection of the appropriate nacl concentration for test medium for oxacillin susceptibility testing of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci has been problematic when using different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods. broth microdilution, using cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth + 2% nacl, is the currently recommended reference method. there is currently no recommendation for the addition of nacl to agar for dilution susceptibility tests when staphylococcus species are tested with oxacillin. we examined the effects of adding 0, 2%, 4%, and 5% nacl to mueller-hinton agar and broth for agar dilution, etest, and broth microdilution tests. the results of these tests were compared with the reference broth microdilution results and with the results of a hybridization assay using a mec gene probe. we tested 223 strains of staphylococci, 128 of which were mec gene positive and had oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) > or = 4 micrograms/ml. seven strains of s. aureus were mec probe negative but were oxacillin resistant. seven coagulase-negative strains (three s. epidermidis, one s. haemolyticus, and three s. simulans) were mec probe positive and were oxacillin susceptible. the mics for oxacillin-resistant strains increased two- to fourfold with the addition of 2% nacl, but the mics for oxacillin-susceptible strains were unchanged. major and very major interpretative rates ranged from 18.2% to 20.2% for agar dilution and etest without nacl added to the medium, and these rates decreased to < 1% with the addition of 2% nacl to the medium. the addition of 4% or 5% nacl caused major error rates of > 17% for all test methods.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
in vitro activity of ro 23-9424, a dual-action antibacterial agent, against bacterial isolates from cancer patients compared with those of other agents.
the in vitro activity of ro 23-9424 against bacterial isolates from patients with cancer was compared with those of fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone, and ceftazidime. ro 23-9424 inhibited the majority of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae and all aeromonas isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was also active against acinetobacter spp. and haemophilus influenzae, including beta-lactamase-producing strains. the mic for 90% of isolates (mic90) of pseudomonas aeruginosa was 16.0 micrograms/ml. all group a and b streptococci were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml, and 90% of group g streptococci and streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 1.0 micrograms/ml. all methicillin-susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus and 60% of methicillin-resistant strains were susceptible to 2.0 micrograms of ro 23-9424 per ml, whereas the mic90 for staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus hominis isolates was 4.0 micrograms/ml. staphylococcus haemolyticus and enterococcus spp. were less susceptible; mic90s for them were 16.0 and 32.0 micrograms/ml. ro 23-9424 has a broad antibacterial spectrum and potential utility for therapy of infections in cancer patients.
in vitro activity of decaplanin (m86-1410), a new glycopeptide antibiotic.
the in vitro activity of decaplanin (formerly m86-1410), a novel glycopeptide antimicrobial agent, was tested against 169 gram-positive bloodstream isolates from patients at the university of iowa hospitals and clinics and 12 selected vancomycin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, bacilli, corynebacteria, and listeria were inhibited by decaplanin (mics for 90% of the strains tested [mic90s], 0.12 to 4 micrograms/ml). however, some rarely isolated and selected enterococcus sp. populations had a mic90 of 16 micrograms/ml, and s. haemolyticus strains had a mic90 of 8 micrograms/ml. these in vitro results suggest that decaplanin may be useful against most gram-positive strains, even though some enterococcus species and coagulase-negative staphylococci were potentially resistant (mics, greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml).
comparative in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin against united states teicoplanin clinical trial isolates of gram-positive cocci.
in this study, the in vitro activity of teicoplanin and vancomycin was directly compared against 503 gram-positive cocci isolated during the u.s. teicoplanin clinical trials. both antibiotics were equally active against oxacillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-sensitive and oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, and other coagulase-negative staphylococci, except staphylococcus haemolyticus. teicoplanin was fourfold more active than vancomycin against oxacillin-resistant s. aureus (mic90, 0.5 vs. 2.0 micrograms/ml), whereas vancomycin was more active than teicoplanin (mic90, 2.0 vs. 8.0 micrograms/ml) against oxacillin-resistant s. haemolyticus. teicoplanin was two- to eightfold more active than vancomycin against the streptococci and enterococci tested.
vitronectin and type-i collagen binding by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci.
binding of 125i-labelled type-i collagen and 125i-labelled vitronectin (human serum spreading factor or s-protein) was studied using staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci of different species. binding of collagen and vitronectin was time dependent for s. aureus isp 546, and s. haemolyticus e 2498/86. co-operative binding of vitronectin and collagen by staphylococcal cells was demonstrated. binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 was more rapid and was enhanced in vitronectin/collagen mixtures than for either protein separately. furthermore, pre-incubation of staphylococcal cells with unlabelled collagen enhanced vitronectin binding. when cells of s. haemolyticus e 2498/86 were treated with pronase e, proteinase k, subtilopeptidase a or trypsin, vitronectin-binding was decreased by 50% or more, whereas collagen-binding was protease resistant. for the strains of s. aureus tested, both vitronectin and collagen binding were found to be protease sensitive. type-i collagen peptides inhibited collagen-binding to s. haemolyticus e 2498/86, whereas vitronectin-binding was not affected perhaps indicating different receptors for these proteins. the binding of both collagen and vitronectin was shown to be reversible, since bound 125i-collagen and 125i-vitronectin were displaced after adding excess of the homologous protein.
[resistance profiles of the various species of the genus staphylococcus to 15 clinically-used antimicrobials].
a total of 78 strains of 11 species of staphylococcus genus (29 s. aureus, 48 staphylococcus coagulase-negative and 1 s. intermedius strain,) were studied in order to determine the resistance patterns to fifteen commonly used antimicrobial agents. out of 48 staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains studied, 8 (4/15 s. epidermidis, 1/10 s. hominis, 1/6 s. haemolyticus, 2/3 s. xylosus) showed resistance patterns similar to that of s. aureus strains against beta-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol and fosfomycin, and 10 exhibit beta-lactamase-activity. although the 7 s. saprophyticus strains assayed were beta-lactamase-negative by the chromogenic cephalosporin method after induction, the penicillin g minimal inhibitory concentration values were slightly higher than those obtained with other beta-lactamase-negative species. the susceptibilities to erythromycin and clindamycin suggested that macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin type b (mls) resistance was present in a large number of staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. in all the staphylococcus genus, the aminoglycosides resistance seems to be mediated by the same aminoglycosides modifying-enzymes. vancomycin was very active against the 11 species assayed. rifampicin was effective with all staphylococcus coagulase-negative strains. the s. aureus rifampicin-resistant were also resistant to oxacillin, and variable against aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, erythromycin and clindamycin. only 5 strains were resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (tms), 1 s. aureus oxacillin-susceptible, 1 s. aureus oxacillin-resistant, 2 s. xylosus and 1 s. warneri strains.
antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial isolates of staphylococcus haemolyticus.
staphylococcus haemolyticus is frequently cultured from hospitalized patients and is characterized by resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. we found that s. haemolyticus represented 70 of 524 (13%) coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates identified by the clinical microbiology laboratories of two hospitals over 2 months. s. haemolyticus isolates were recovered from wounds (44%), urine (26%), blood (10%), and other sources (20%). all s. haemolyticus isolates were tested for susceptibility to six antimicrobial agents; 77% were resistant to three or more agents, and 41% were resistant to five or six agents. in addition, among 47 multiply resistant isolates, high mics (greater than or equal to 6.25 micrograms/ml) of vancomycin (62% of isolates) and teicoplanin (91% of isolates) were found. dna probes which were derived from s. epidermidis or s. aureus and which contained sequences associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents were used to detect specific genes in the total cellular and plasmid dnas of 10 resistant s. haemolyticus isolates. resistance gene probes and the numbers of resistant isolates hybridizing were as follows: methicillin, 10 of 10; gentamicin, 9 of 10; erythromycin, 7 of 10; and trimethoprim, 0 of 10. genes for resistance to methicillin were found only in chromosomal locations, genes for resistance to gentamicin were found in both chromosomal and plasmid locations, and genes for resistance to erythromycin were found in plasmid locations only. with the exception of trimethoprim resistance determinants, similar genes were found among concurrently isolated multiply resistant s. epidermidis isolates from our hospitals. s. haemolyticus is a potentially important nosocomial species which readily acquires antimicrobial resistance genes and which shares, to some extent, in a common gene pool with s. epidermidis.
the in vitro activity of ramoplanin (a-16686/mdl 62,198), vancomycin and teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp.
ramoplanin (a-16686/mdl 62,198) is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial, comprised of three closely related polypeptides containing chlorinated phenyl moieties and d-mannose, isolated from the fermentation products of actinoplanes sp. atcc 33076. the antimicrobial activity of ramoplanin is limited to gram-positive bacteria and its reportedly unacceptable administration side-effects suggest that any potential clinical role will be limited to the topical therapy of superficial skin infections and the eradication of bacteria, representing a possible nosocomial cross-infection source, from carriage sites. in this study the mics of ramoplanin have been determined for methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus and compared with those of two glycopeptide antimicrobials, vancomycin and teicoplanin. mics were determined using an agar incorporation technique in mueller-hinton medium with an inoculum of 10(5) cfu. ramoplanin was 2-8 times more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant isolates of s. aureus and methicillin-susceptible isolates of s. epidermidis. isolates of methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis and both methicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of s. haemolyticus were generally less susceptible to teicoplanin than to vancomycin. ramoplanin was significantly more active than either vancomycin or teicoplanin against these isolates. these results suggest that the clinical evaluation of ramoplanin as a topical antibacterial agent for the control of superficial infections caused by staphylococcus spp. and for the eradication of methicillin-resistant s. aureus from carriage sites, is justified.
quality control limits for teicoplanin susceptibility tests and confirmation of disk diffusion interpretive criteria.
for monitoring the performance of teicoplanin susceptibility tests, the following quality control limits are recommended: staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213, mic of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, mic of 0.06 to 0.25 micrograms/ml; and s. aureus atcc 25923, zones 15 to 19 mm in diameter (30-micrograms disks). however, some lots of mueller-hinton agar provided unusually large zones of inhibition with both vancomycin and teicoplanin disks, and these lots should be excluded before routine use. teicoplanin and vancomycin differed only in their activity against oxacillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus haemolyticus, which had decreased susceptibility to teicoplanin but were fully susceptible to vancomycin. for tests with 30-micrograms teicoplanin disks, zones less than or equal to 10 and greater than or equal to 14 mm in diameter represent resistant and susceptible breakpoints, respectively.
[comparison of the antibacterial efficacy of doxycycline and tetracycline (author's transl)].
in order to explain the mechanism of resistance within the tetracycline group, the minimal inhibitory concentration of tetracycline hcl was compared with that of doxycycline in the micro dilution test for bacterial collectives of 48 strains each from the groups of gram-negative and gram-positive cocci, resp. there was no significant difference between the inhibitory effect of doxycycline and tetracycline hcl for the bacterial collectives of e. coli, klebsiella, proteus and staphylococcus aureus heamolyticus strains which were inhibited by a relatively low concentration of tetracycline hcl and doxycycline, respectively. on the other hand a significant difference in inhibitory effect was observed the calculation was made according to the kolmogoroff-smirnov test for the bacterial collectives of enterococci and staphylococcus aureus haemolyticus strains which were tetracycline resistant or only inhibited by higher concentrations. these results also have a practical importance, because a further testing against doxycycline can bring about a sensitivity to this substance in case of tetracycline resistant grampositive cocci. possible explanations for the higher efficacy of doxycycline on these bacterial collectives will be discussed.
