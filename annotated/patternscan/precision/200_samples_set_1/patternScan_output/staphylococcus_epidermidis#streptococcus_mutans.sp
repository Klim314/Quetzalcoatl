TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus extract.
AB  == rhinacanthins-rich rhinacanthus nasutus (rrn) extract was prepared and standardized to contain total rhinacantins not less than 70% w/w. in this study,  antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract as well as rhinacanthin-c against streptococcus mutans, propionibacterium acnes, helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis and candida albicans were evaluated by microdilution assay. it was found that the rrn extract exhibited potent bactericidal activity against s. mutans with mic and mbc of 4 microg/ml, and potent bacteriostatic activity against s. epidermidis, p. acnes and s. aureus with the mics of 8-16 microg/ml. however, the rrn extract was not active against  c. albicans at concentration up to 2000 microg/ml. the antimicrobial activities of the rrn extract was almost equal to those of rhinacanthin-c. stability evaluations of the rrn extract through a period of 4 months found that the rrn extracts were stable when kept in a well-closed container protected from light and stored either under 4+/-2 degrees c or 30+/-2 degrees c. the rrn extracts that were exposed to light were not stable after 1 week of storage. under accelerated conditions at 45 degrees c with 75% relative humidity, the rrn extracts were not stable after 8 weeks of storage. study on the effect of ph on the stability of the aqueous methanolic solution of the rrn extract found that the solutions were not stable at ph 5.5, ph 7.0, and ph 8.0. however, the rhinacanthin solution at ph 5.5 was more stable than those at ph 7.0 and ph 8.0.

TI  == frequency and expression of mutacin biosynthesis genes in isolates of streptococcus mutans with different mutacin-producing phenotypes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to analyse the frequency and expression of biosynthesis genes in 47 streptococcus mutans isolates with different mutacin-producing phenotypes. detection of the frequency and expression of genes encoding mutacin types i, ii, iii and iv were carried out by pcr and semi-quantitative rt-pcr, respectively, using primers specific for each type of biosynthesis gene. in addition, a further eight genes encoding putative bacteriocins, designated bsm 283, bsm 299, bsm 423, bsm 1889c, bsm 1892c, bsm 1896, bsm 1906c and bsm 1914, were also screened. there was a high phenotypic diversity; some streptococcus mutans isolates presented broad antimicrobial spectra against other streptococcus mutans clinical isolates, including bacteria resistant to common antibiotics, as  well as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis  and streptococcus pyogenes. the expression frequency of the bsm gene was higher than that of the previously characterized mutacins (i-iv). there was no positive  correlation between the number of indicator strains inhibited (antimicrobial spectra) and the number of biosynthesis genes expressed (spearman correlation test, r=-0.03, p>0.05). in conclusion, the high diversity of mutacin-producing phenotypes, associated with high frequency of expression of the biosynthesis genes screened, reveals a broad repertoire of genetic determinants encoding antimicrobial peptides that can act in different combinations.
