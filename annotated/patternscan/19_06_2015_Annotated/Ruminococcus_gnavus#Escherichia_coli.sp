TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == in vitro fermentation of fructooligosaccharides with human gut bacteria.
AB  == fructooligosaccharides (fos) are one of the most studied prebiotics, selectively  stimulating the growth of health-promoting bacteria in the host. however, there is increasing evidence that commensal gut bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis, clostridium butyricum, enterobacter cloacae, and even the pathogenic escherichia  coli ben2908, are also able to metabolize fos in vitro, and in some cases, fos displayed adverse effects. therefore, it is necessary to identify fos-metabolizing species that are present in the gut. unlike previous studies focusing on individual strains, this study used the traditional culture method combined with an alignment search on the gut bacteria database established from the human microbiome project (hmp). the alignment results showed that homologous  proteins for fos transporters and glycosidases were distributed in 237 of the 453 strains of gut bacteria. la506 msmk encoding the atp-binding protein and aec45 fosgh1 encoding glycoside hydrolase were most widely distributed, in 155 and 55 strains, respectively. seven of eight strains with both transporters and glycosidases were proven to be capable of metabolizing fos, while five strains without either transporters or glycosidases were not. fifteen species isolated from human feces and 11 species from the alignment search were identified to be fos-metabolizing, of which cronobacter sakazakii, marvinbryantia formatexigens, ruminococcus gnavus, and weissella paramesenteroides are reported here for the first time. thus, alignment search combined with the culture method is an effective method for obtaining a global view of the fos-metabolizing bacteria in  the gut and will be helpful in further investigating the relationship between fos and human gut bacteria.

TI  == induction of bacterial antigen-specific colitis by a simplified human microbiota  consortium in gnotobiotic interleukin-10-/- mice.
AB  == we evaluated whether a simplified human microbiota consortium (sihumi) induces colitis in germfree (gf) 129s6/svev (129) and c57bl/6 (b6) interleukin-10-deficient (il-10(-/-)) mice, determined mouse strain effects on colitis and the microbiota, examined the effects of inflammation on relative bacterial composition, and identified immunodominant bacterial species in "humanized" il-10(-/-) mice. gf wild-type (wt) and il-10(-/-) 129 and b6 mice were colonized with 7 human-derived inflammatory bowel disease (ibd)-related intestinal bacteria and maintained under gnotobiotic conditions. quantification of bacteria in feces, ileal and colonic contents, and tissues was performed using 16s rrna gene selective quantitative pcr. colonic segments were scored histologically, and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), il-12p40, and il-17 levels were measured in supernatants of unstimulated colonic tissue explants and of mesenteric lymph node (mln) cells stimulated by lysates of individual or aggregate bacterial strains. relative bacterial species abundances changed over time and differed between 129 and b6 mice, wt and il-10(-/-) mice, luminal and mucosal samples, and ileal and colonic or fecal samples. sihumi induced colitis in all il-10(-/-) mice, with more aggressive colitis and mln cell activation in 129 mice. escherichia coli lf82 and ruminococcus gnavus lysates induced dominant  effector ex vivo mln th1 and th17 responses, although the bacterial mucosal concentrations were low. in summary, this study shows that a simplified human bacterial consortium induces colitis in ex-gf 129 and b6 il-10(-/-) mice. relative concentrations of individual sihumi species are determined by host genotype, the presence of inflammation, and anatomical location. a subset of ibd-relevant human enteric bacterial species preferentially stimulates bacterial  antigen-specific th1 and th17 immune responses in this model, independent of luminal and mucosal bacterial concentrations.

TI  == contribution of the 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from ruminococcus gnavus n53 to ursodeoxycholic acid formation in the human colon.
AB  == bile acid composition in the colon is determined by bile acid flow in the intestines, the population of bile acid-converting bacteria, and the properties of the responsible bacterial enzymes. ursodeoxycholic acid (udca) is regarded as  a chemopreventive beneficial bile acid due to its low hydrophobicity. however, it is a minor constituent of human bile acids. here, we characterized an udca-producing bacterium, n53, isolated from human feces. 16s rdna sequence analysis identified this isolate as ruminococcus gnavus, a novel udca-producer. the forward reaction that produces udca from 7-oxo-lithocholic acid was observed  to have a growth-dependent conversion rate of 90-100% after culture in gam broth  containing 1 mm 7-oxo-lithocholic acid, while the reverse reaction was undetectable. the gene encoding 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (7beta-hsdh),  which facilitates the udca-producing reaction, was cloned and overexpressed in escherichia coli. characterization of the purified 7beta-hsdh revealed that the kcat/km value was about 55-fold higher for the forward reaction than for the reverse reaction, indicating that the enzyme favors the udca-producing reaction.  as r. gnavus is a common, core bacterium of the human gut microbiota, these results suggest that this bacterium plays a pivotal role in udca formation in the colon.

TI  == functional analysis of family gh36 alpha-galactosidases from ruminococcus gnavus  e1: insights into the metabolism of a plant oligosaccharide by a human gut symbiont.
AB  == ruminococcus gnavus belongs to the 57 most common species present in 90% of individuals. previously, we identified an alpha-galactosidase (aga1) belonging to glycoside hydrolase (gh) family 36 from r. gnavus e1 (m. aguilera, h. rakotoarivonina, a. brutus, t. giardina, g. simon, and m. fons, res. microbiol. 163:14-21, 2012). here, we identified a novel gh36-encoding gene from the same strain and termed it aga2. although aga1 showed a very simple genetic organization, aga2 is part of an operon of unique structure, including genes putatively encoding a regulator, a gh13, two phosphotransferase system (pts) sequences, and a gh32, probably involved in extracellular and intracellular sucrose assimilation. the 727-amino-acid (aa) deduced aga2 protein shares approximately 45% identity with aga1. both aga1 and aga2 expressed in escherichia coli showed strict specificity for alpha-linked galactose. both enzymes were active on natural substrates such as melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. aga1 and aga2 occurred as homotetramers in solution, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. modeling of aga1 and aga2 identified key amino acids which may be involved in substrate specificity and stabilization of the alpha-linked galactoside substrates within the active site. furthermore, aga1 and aga2 were both able to perform transglycosylation reactions with alpha-(1,6) regioselectivity, leading to the formation of product structures up to [hex](12)  and [hex](8), respectively. we suggest that aga1 and aga2 play essential roles in the metabolism of dietary oligosaccharides and could be used for the design of galacto-oligosaccharide (gos) prebiotics, known to selectively modulate the beneficial gut microbiota.

TI  == dysbiosis of the faecal microbiota in patients with crohn's disease and their unaffected relatives.
AB  == background and aims: a general dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota has been established in patients with crohn's disease (cd), but a systematic characterisation of this dysbiosis is lacking. therefore the composition of the predominant faecal microbiota of patients with cd was studied in comparison with  the predominant composition in unaffected controls. whether dysbiosis is present  in relatives of patients cd was also examined. methods: focusing on families with at least three members affected with cd, faecal samples of 68 patients with cd, 84 of their unaffected relatives and 55 matched controls were subjected to community fingerprinting of the predominant microbiota using denaturing gradient  gel electrophoresis (dgge). to analyse the dgge profiles, bionumerics software and non-parametric statistical analyses (spss v.17.0) were used. observed differences in the predominant microbiota were subsequently confirmed and quantified with real-time pcr. results: five bacterial species characterised dysbiosis in cd, namely a decrease in dialister invisus (p=0.04), an uncharacterised species of clostridium cluster xiva (p = 0.03), faecalibacterium  prausnitzii (p < 1.3 x 10(-)(5)) and bifidobacterium adolescentis (p = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)), and an increase in ruminococcus gnavus (p = 2.1 x 10(-)(7)). unaffected relatives of patients with cd had less collinsella aerofaciens (p = 0.004) and a member of the escherichia coli-shigella group (p = 0.01) and more ruminococcus torques (p = 0.02) in their predominant microbiota as compared with  healthy subjects. conclusion: unaffected relatives of patients with cd have a different composition of their microbiota compared with healthy controls. this dysbiosis is not characterised by lack of butyrate producing-bacteria as observed in cd but suggests a role for microorganisms with mucin degradation capacity.

TI  == genetic characterization of the beta-glucuronidase enzyme from a human intestinal bacterium, ruminococcus gnavus.
AB  == beta-glucuronidase activity (encoded by the gus gene) has been characterized for  the first time from ruminococcus gnavus e1, an anaerobic bacterium belonging to the dominant human gut microbiota. beta-glucuronidase activity plays a major role in the generation of toxic and carcinogenic metabolites in the large intestine, as well as in the absorption and enterohepatic circulation of many aglycone residues with protective effects, such as lignans, flavonoids, ceramide and glycyrrhetinic acid, that are liberated by the hydrolysis of the corresponding glucuronides. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4537 bp dna fragment containing the beta-glucuronidase locus from r. gnavus e1 was determined. five orfs were detected on this fragment: three complete orfs (orf2, gus and orf3) and two partial orfs (orf4 and orf5). the products of orf2 and orf3 show strong similarities with many beta-glucoside permeases of the phosphoenolpyruvate : beta-glucoside phosphotransferase systems (ptss), such as escherichia coli bglc,  bacillus subtilis bglp and bacillus halodurans pts enzyme ii. the product of orf5 presents strong similarities with the amino-terminal domain of clostridium acetobutylicum beta-glucosidase (bgla). the gus gene product presents similarities with several known beta-glucuronidase enzymes, including those of lactobacillus gasseri (69%), e. coli (61%), clostridium perfringens (59%) and staphylococcus aureus (58%). by complementing an e. coli strain in which the uida gene encoding the enzyme was deleted, it was confirmed that the r. gnavus gus gene encodes the beta-glucuronidase enzyme. moreover, it was found that the gus gene was transcribed as part of an operon that includes orf2, orf3 and orf5.
