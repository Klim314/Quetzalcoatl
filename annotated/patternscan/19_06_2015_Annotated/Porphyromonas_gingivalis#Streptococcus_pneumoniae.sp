TI  == platelets and infections - complex interactions with bacteria.
AB  == platelets can be considered sentinels of vascular system due to their high number in the circulation and to the range of functional immunoreceptors they express. platelets express a wide range of potential bacterial receptors, including complement receptors, fcgammarii, toll-like receptors but also integrins conventionally described in the hemostatic response, such as gpiib-iiia or gpib.  bacteria bind these receptors either directly, or indirectly via fibrinogen, fibronectin, the first complement c1q, the von willebrand factor, etc. the fate of platelet-bound bacteria is questioned. several studies reported the ability of activated platelets to internalize bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus or porphyromonas gingivalis, though there is no clue on what happens thereafter. are they sheltered from the immune system in the cytoplasm of platelets or are they lysed? indeed, while the presence of phagolysosome has not been demonstrated in platelets, they contain antimicrobial peptides that were shown to be efficient on s. aureus. besides, the fact that bacteria can bind to platelets via receptors involved in hemostasis suggests that they may induce aggregation; this has indeed been described for streptococcus sanguinis, s. epidermidis, or c. pneumoniae. on  the other hand, platelets are able to display an inflammatory response to an infectious triggering. we, and others, have shown that platelet release soluble immunomodulatory factors upon stimulation by bacterial components. moreover, interactions between bacteria and platelets are not limited to only these two partners. indeed, platelets are also essential for the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial clearance by trapping  bacteria and concentrating antibacterial factors but in enhancing thrombosis. in  conclusion, the platelet-bacteria interplay is a complex game; its fine analysis  is complicated by the fact that the inflammatory component adds to the aggregation response.

TI  == 16s rdna-based metagenomic analysis of dental plaque and lung bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == background and objective: acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (ae-copd) are leading causes of mortality in hospital intensive care units. we sought to determine whether dental plaque biofilms might harbor pathogenic bacteria that can eventually cause lung infections in patients with severe ae-copd. material and methods: paired samples of subgingival plaque biofilm and tracheal aspirate were collected from 53 patients with severe ae-copd. total bacterial dna was extracted from each sample individually for polymerase chain reaction amplification and/or generation of bacterial 16s rdna sequences and cdna libraries. we used a metagenomic approach, based on bacterial  16s rdna sequences, to compare the distribution of species present in dental plaque and lung. results: analysis of 1060 sequences (20 clones per patient) revealed a wide range of aerobic, anaerobic, pathogenic, opportunistic, novel and uncultivable bacterial species. species indistinguishable between the paired subgingival plaque and tracheal aspirate samples (97-100% similarity in 16s rdna  sequence) were dental plaque pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) and lung pathogens (acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus pneumoniae). real-time polymerase chain reaction of 16s rdna indicated lower levels of pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis colonizing the dental plaques compared with the paired tracheal aspirate samples. conclusion: these results support the  hypothesis that dental bacteria may contribute to the pathology of severe ae-copd.

TI  == prevotella intermedia induces severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia in mice with upregulated platelet-activating factor receptor expression.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of respiratory infection worldwide. although oral hygiene has been considered a risk factor for developing pneumonia, the relationship between oral bacteria and pneumococcal infection is unknown. in  this study, we examined the synergic effects of prevotella intermedia, a major periodontopathic bacterium, on pneumococcal pneumonia. the synergic effects of the supernatant of p. intermedia (pisup) on pneumococcal pneumonia were investigated in mice, and the stimulation of pneumococcal adhesion to human alveolar (a549) cells by pisup was assessed. the effects of pisup on platelet-activating factor receptor (pafr) transcript levels in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr, and the differences between the effects of pneumococcal infection induced by various periodontopathic bacterial species were verified in mice. mice inoculated with s. pneumoniae plus pisup exhibited a significantly lower survival rate, higher bacterial loads in the lungs, spleen, and blood, and higher inflammatory cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) than those infected without pisup. in a549 cells, pisup increased pneumococcal adhesion and pafr transcript levels. pisup also increased  lung pafr transcript levels in mice. similar effects were not observed in the supernatants of porphyromonas gingivalis or fusobacterium nucleatum. thus, p. intermedia has the potential to induce severe bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia with enhanced pneumococcal adhesion to lower airway cells.

TI  == molecular mapping to species level of the tonsillar crypt microbiota associated with health and recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  == the human palatine tonsils, which belong to the central antigen handling sites of the mucosal immune system, are frequently affected by acute and recurrent infections. this study compared the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts in children and adults affected by recurrent tonsillitis with that of healthy adults and children with tonsillar hyperplasia. an in-depth 16s rrna gene based pyrosequencing approach combined with a novel strategy that included phylogenetic analysis and detection of species-specific sequence signatures enabled identification of the major part of the microbiota to species level. a complex microbiota consisting of between 42 and 110 taxa was demonstrated in both children and adults. this included a core microbiome of 12 abundant genera found  in all samples regardless of age and health status. yet, haemophilus influenzae,  neisseria species, and streptococcus pneumoniae were almost exclusively detected  in children. in contrast, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae was present in all samples. obligate anaerobes like porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium were abundantly present in children, but the species diversity of porphyromonas and prevotella was larger in adults and included species that are considered putative pathogens in periodontal diseases, i.e. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and tannerella forsythia. unifrac analysis showed that recurrent tonsillitis is associated with a shift in the microbiota of the tonsillar crypts. fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus intermedius and prevotella melaninogenica/histicola were associated with recurrent tonsillitis in adults, whereas species traditionally associated with acute tonsillitis like pyogenic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus were scarce. the findings suggest that recurrent tonsillitis is a polymicrobial infection in which interactions within consortia of taxa play an etiologic role. the study contributes to the human microbiome data, to the understanding of the etiology of infections affecting the tonsils, and forms a basis for further insight into the consequences of the intense microbe-host interactions that take place in the tonsils.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == evaluation of the microseq 500 16s rdna-based gene sequencing for the diagnosis of culture-negative bacterial meningitis.
AB  == gene amplification using 16s rdna primers has been proposed as a strategy for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna test (applied biosystems) from  patients with suspected bacterial meningitis and csf negative-culture in comparison to traditional methods. twelve purulent culture-negative csf samples were collected between january 2005 and january 2007. for dna extraction, 500 microl of csf samples were treated using the qiaamp mini kit (qiagen). the extracted dna was examined amplifying 500 bp at the 5' end of 16s rrna gene using microseq500 16s rdna bacterial identification pcr kit and the sequencing reactions were performed with the microseq500 16s rdna bacterial identification sequencing kit (applied biosystems). the sequences were compared with those available in genbank. for the culture-negative csf samples the microseq 500 16s rdna yielded a positive result in 9 cases (75.0%): three samples were identified  as streptococcus. pneumoniae, three as neisseria meningitidis, and the remaining  3 as haemophilus influenzae, abiotrophia defectiva and porphyromonas gingivalis.  the microseq 500 16s ribosomal dna test may improve the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, especially when spinal fluid samples are obtained after  the administration of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == [periodontitis and cardiovascular disease].
AB  == the prevalence of periodontitis and cardiovascular disease (cvd) is high. a mixed infectious biofilm etiology of periodontitis is known but not fully established in cvd. cofactors; smoking habits, stress, ethnicity, genetics, socioeconomics and age contribute to both diseases. the objectives of this report are to summarize factors in regards to cvd and periodontitis that are clinically relevant. the hypothesis behind a relationship between the two conditions can be  founded in (i) shared infections etiology, (ii) shared inflammatory response, (iii) epidemiological and case-control studies, and (iv) periodontal studies demonstrating improvements of cvd markers. streptococcus species in the s. mitis  group, and s. anginosus group have been identified in periodontitis and are known as pathogens in endocarditis possibly transported from the oral cavity to the heart through bacteremia during dental therapies, and tooth brushing. other periodontal bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra are beta-lactamase producing and may contribute to antibiotic resistance (extended spectrum beta-lactamases). other bacteria in cvd  and periodontitis include staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. chlamydia pneumoniae and p. gingivalis lipopolyysaccharide capsels share homology and induce heat-shock protein activity and a cascade of proinflammatory cytokines. associations between periodontitis and cvd have been presented in many studies when controlling for confounders. other studies have demonstrated that periodontal therapies increase brachial artery flow rate and reduce serum inflammatory cytokine levels. thus, physicians caring for subjects at cvd risk should consult with dentists/periodontists. dentists must improve their medical knowledge and also learn to consult with physicians when treating patients at cvd risk.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == involvement of periodontopathic anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.
AB  == increasing evidence has linked the anaerobic bacteria forming periodontopathic biofilms with aspiration pneumonia in elderly persons. in experiments designed to eliminate the potent respiratory pathogens forming biofilms in the oral cavity, we have shown that the mechanical and chemical oral cleansing using povidone-iodine effectively reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and haemophilus influenzae in patients scheduled to undergo oral surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. we confirmed the pathogenicity of periodontopathic anaerobic bacteria for aspiration pneumonia in an experimental mouse model. based upon the finding of the coexistence of porphyromonas gingivalis with treponema denticola in chronic periodontitis lesions, we innoculated a mixed culture of p.  gingivalis and t. denticola into the mouse trachea; the resulting infection induced inflammatory cytokine production and caused pneumonia. in another series  of investigations, professional oral health care (pohc), mainly cleansing administered by dental hygienists once a week for 24 months to elderly persons requiring daily care, resulted in the reduction of the number of total anaerobes, candida albicans, and staphylococcus species and in the number of cases of fatal  aspiration pneumonia. we also found that the pohc treatment of elderly persons for 6 months in the winter season reduced the salivary levels of protease, trypsin-like activity, and neuraminidase and also decreased the frequency of influenza cases.

TI  == interactions of oral pathogens with toll-like receptors: possible role in atherosclerosis.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlr) function as important signal transducers that mediate innate immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens through pattern recognition of virulence molecules. although tlrs mediate protection against infection, it is also likely that they may have a pathophysiologic role in certain inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. in atherosclerotic lesions, endothelial cells  and macrophages have been shown to upregulate tlr expression and may respond to tlr agonists of microbial origin, resulting in detrimental inflammatory reactions. some of these potential tlr-activating virulence factors may be of oral origin. the detection in atherosclerotic plaques of dna specific for porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontal pathogens suggests that these pathogens disseminate into the systemic circulation and localize in atheromas. the potential of periodontal and some other oral pathogens to activate tlrs in vivo is suggested by findings from cell culture experiments on interactions of selected virulence protein adhesins with tlrs and their coreceptors. specifically, we have shown that proinflammatory cytokine induction by p. gingivalis fimbriae was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to tlr2, tlr4, cd14, and beta2 integrins, but not by immunoglobulin isotype controls. cytokine induction by bacteroides forsythus protein a depended heavily on cd14 and tlr2. we also found that the ability of streptococcus mutans protein agi/ii to stimulate cytokine release was partially dependent on cd14 and tlr4. moreover, p. gingivalis fimbriae induced tlr-dependent activation of nuclear factor-kappab and upregulation of costimulatory molecules in monocytic cells. these proinflammatory activities have been implicated in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, and similar inflammatory mechanisms could potentially operate in atherosclerosis. studies by  other groups have shown that p. gingivalis is capable of stimulating low-density  lipoprotein oxidation, foam cell formation, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaque through induction of matrix metalloproteinases. interestingly, at least some of these activities can be induced by tlr agonists (lipopolysaccharide and heat-shock protein-60) from chlamydia pneumoniae, a major risk factor in atherosclerosis. future research in animal models and in vitro cellular systems with defined mutations in tlrs may implicate tlr participation in oral pathogen-mediated atherosclerotic processes, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the epidemiological findings linking oral pathogens to atherosclerotic  disease.

TI  == reduction of potential respiratory pathogens by oral hygienic treatment in patients undergoing endotracheal anesthesia.
AB  == purpose: this study was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of mechanical and chemical prophylactic oral cleansing treatments for reducing potential respiratory pathogens existing in the oral cavity. methods: thirty-two patients scheduled to undergo oral and maxillofacial surgery that required endotracheal anesthesia were randomly allocated to one of the two groups, the oral cleansing group (n = 16) or the noncleansing group (n = 16). culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods were used to detect and enumerate pathogens. oral cleansing was carried out with an electric toothbrush capable of automatically supplying and aspirating povidone-iodine solution before surgery, followed by rinsing twice a day after surgery. cephazolin (3 g x day(-1)) was given to all patients for 5 days after surgery. results: the pcr detection rates of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and porphyromonas gingivalis in gargle samples before treatment were 87.5%, 68.8%, 53.1%, and 40.6%, respectively. oral cleansing reduced the detection rates and numbers of methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. in contrast, there was no significant reduction of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus species, s. pneumoniae, h. influenzae, or p. aeruginosa in subjects who underwent systemic cephazolin administration without oral cleansing. conclusion: the combination of mechanical and chemical oral cleansing resulted in a significant reduction of potential respiratory pathogens  in the oral cavity.

TI  == modulating airway defenses against microbes.
AB  == prevention and treatment of respiratory infections remain an important health care challenge as the us population ages, contains more susceptible or high-risk  people, and encounters new pathogens or antibiotic resistant bacteria. reasonably protective vaccines against very common microbes are available for childhood and  adult immunization, but, generally, these are underutilized. a broader definition of higher risk individuals is evolving, which will include more for immunization. different approaches to vaccine development through design of new component vaccines are necessary. this review has updated host defense mechanisms at three  levels in the human respiratory tract: naso-oropharynx (upper airways), conducting airways, and alveolar space. examples of representative pathogenic microbes have been inserted at the respective airway segment where they may colonize or create infection (influenza, measles virus, porphyromonas gingivalis  causing periodontitis, bordetella pertussis, chlamydia pneumoniae, streptococcus  pneumoniae, and bacillus anthracis ). hopefully, microbe-host interactions will suggest new approaches for preventing these kinds of infections.

TI  == oral bacteria and respiratory infection: effects on respiratory pathogen adhesion and epithelial cell proinflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == several microbiologic and epidemiologic studies have suggested an association between dental plaque, poor oral health, and respiratory diseases such as nosocomial pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). a number of hypotheses are suggested to help explain how oral bacteria may participate in  the pathogenesis of respiratory infection. resident bacteria in oral secretions are likely aspirated along with respiratory pathogens and may affect the adhesion of the later organisms to the respiratory epithelium. preliminary studies performed in our laboratory suggest that oral bacteria may modulate the adhesion  of respiratory pathogens to epithelial cell lines. in addition, oral bacterial products or cytokines in oral/pharyngeal aspirates may stimulate cytokine production from respiratory epithelial cells, resulting in recruitment of inflammatory cells. the resulting inflamed epithelium may be more susceptible to  respiratory infection. further preliminary data are presented that some species of oral bacteria may induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cell lines to an extent similar to that seen for respiratory pathogens.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial rnase p by aminoglycoside-arginine conjugates.
AB  == the potential of rnas and rna-protein (rnp) complexes as drug targets is currently being explored in various investigations. for example, a hexa-arginine  derivative of neomycin (neor) and a tri-arginine derivative of gentamicin (r3g) were recently shown to disrupt essential rnp interactions between the trans-activator protein (tat) and the tat-responsive rna (trans-activating region) in the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and also inhibit hiv replication in cell culture. based on certain structural similarities, we postulated that neor and r3g might also be effective in disrupting rnp interactions and thereby inhibiting bacterial rnase p, an essential rnp complex involved in trna maturation. our results indicate that indeed both neor and r3g inhibit rnase p activity from evolutionarily divergent pathogenic bacteria and do so more effectively than they inhibit partially purified human rnase p activity.

TI  == mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  == this study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in spain. six different antiseptic mouthrinses  were studied by means of determination of minimal inhibitory concentration (mic)  values against klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus mutans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. results suggested that the determination of mic values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. on the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. all tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and triclosan.

TI  == [implication and mode of action of infectious agents in the formation of atheromatous plaques. infection and atherosclerosis].
AB  == different kinds of infectious agents seem to be implied in the atherosclerotic process. indeed, some bacteria and viruses have been identified in atherosclerotic lesions: chlamydia pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, streptococcus sanguis, porphyromonas gingivalis, herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2, coxsakievirus b and hepatitis virus a. by their ability to induce antigenic and functional changes in the cells of the vascular wall (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages, and fibroblasts) and to stimulate immune response as well as oxidative stress, it is more and more tempting to speculate that infectious agents probably play key roles in the initiation and in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in certain patients.

TI  == multiple infections in carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
AB  == background: chlamydia pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and recently, periodontal disease, have been associated with human atherosclerosis. porphyromonas gingivalis and streptococcus sanguis are major pathogens associated with periodontitis, a common chronic inflammatory condition in adults. investigators have found that these infectious agents may influence vascular cell functions by inducing thrombus formation, vascular cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell death. methods and results: the main purpose of our study was to investigate the relation between the presence of multiple infectious agents in human carotid endarterectomy specimens and pathoanatomic features of the corresponding carotid plaques. histologically, plaque rupture of the fibrous cap  and communication of the luminal thrombus with the central necrotic lipid core was seen in or at proximity to the macrophage-rich shoulder (unstable plaque region). thrombus within the lipid core without plaque rupture was occasionally found near the internal elastic lamina, associated with increased vascularity and lymphocytic infiltrate. apoptosis, as detected by both the immunohistochemical staining of apoptosis-related proteins and in situ labeling of internucleosomally degraded dna, was common in atherosclerotic plaques. immunostainings for c pneumoniae, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, p gingivalis, and s sanguis  were positive in the carotid plaques. from 1 to 4 organisms were found in the same specimen. the micro-organisms were immunolocalized in plaque shoulders and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, associated with ulcer and thrombus formation, and adjacent to areas of strong labeling for apoptotic bodies. conclusions: our data  provide evidence that multiple infectious agents may be found in atherosclerotic  plaques, and sometimes in the same specimen. the current study is the first to report the detection of 2 major odontopathogens, p gingivalis and s sanguis, in atherosclerotic plaques. the immunolocalization of these micro-organisms within unstable plaque regions and their association with plaque ulceration, thrombosis, and apoptosis in vascular cells are intriguing. multiple infectious agents may alter vascular cell function and provide a "trigger" for acute ischemic stroke events. further evidence from human studies and animal models will be needed.

TI  == a murc gene in porphyromonas gingivalis 381.
AB  == the gene encoding a 51 kda polypeptide of porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was isolated by immunoblotting using an antiserum raised against p. gingivalis alkaline phosphatase. dna sequence analysis of a 2.5 kb dna fragment containing a gene encoding the 51 kda protein revealed one complete and two incomplete orfs. database searches using the fasta program revealed significant homology between the p. gingivalis 51 kda protein and the murc protein of escherichia coli, which  functions in peptidoglycan synthesis. the cloned 51 kda protein encoded a functional product that complemented an e. coli murc mutant. moreover, the orf just upstream of murc coded for a protein that was 31% homologous with the e. coli murg protein. the orf just downstream of murc coded for a protein that was 17% homologous with the streptococcus pneumoniae penicillin-binding protein 2b (pbp2b), which functions in peptidoglycan synthesis and is responsible for antibiotic resistance. these results suggest that p. gingivalis contains a homologue of the e. coli peptidoglycan synthesis gene murc and indicate the possibility of a cluster of genes responsible for cell division and cell growth,  as in the e. coli mra region.

AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.
