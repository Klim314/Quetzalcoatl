TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of dysbiosis in ulcerative colitis during remission.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Presence of intestinal microbes is a prerequisite for the development of ulcerative colitis (UC), although deviation of the normal intestinal microbiota composition, dysbiosis, is presumably implicated in the etiology of UC. METHODS: The fecal microbiota of 30 UC samples obtained from 15 patients who were sampled twice and from 15 healthy control subjects originating from 2 geographic locations was analyzed using highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray that has the capacity for detection and quantification of more than 1000 intestinal bacteria in a wide dynamic range. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota composition is not significantly influenced by geographic location, age, or gender, but it differs significantly between the patients with UC and the control subjects (P = 0.0004). UC-associated microbiota is stable during remission and similar among all patients with UC. Significant reduction of bacterial diversity of members of the Clostridium cluster IV and significant reduction in the abundance of bacteria involved in butyrate and propionate metabolism, including Ruminococcus bromii et rel. Eubacterium rectale et rel., Roseburia sp., and Akkermansia sp. are markers of dysbiosis in UC. Increased abundance of (opportunistic) pathogens including Fusobacterium sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., Helicobacter sp., and Campylobacter sp. as well as Clostridium difficile were found to be associated with UC. CONCLUSIONS: Dysbiosis in UC is stable in time and shared between patients from different geographic locations. The microbial alterations offer a mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of the disease.
TI  - [Preliminary investigation of intestinal microflora in patients with hepatic cirrhosis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the differential levels of fecal Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile between patients with hepatic cirrhosis and healthy controls. Fecal samples were collected from 29 patients with hepatic cirrhosis treated in the Department of Digestive Diseases at Zunyi Hospital between March and December of 2010. METHODS: Fecal samples were collected from 13 healthy college students for use as controls. All samples were assessed by pH measurement, bacterial culture for turbidity, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The t-test and rank correlation test were used to determine statistical significance of intergroup differences in each tested parameter. RESULTS: The feces of patients with hepatic cirrhosis had higher pH than that of healthy controls (6.79+/-0.64 vs. 6.18+/-0.74, P less than 0.05). The bacterial turbidity was not significantly different between the feces of hepatic cirrhosis patients and healthy controls (1.15+/-0.59 vs. 1.39+/-1.01, P more than 0.05). The numbers of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Eubacterium rectale-Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus, and Clostridium difficile in feces of patients with hepatic cirrhosis were significantly lower than those of the controls (all P less than 0.01). No significant correlation was found between the number or ratio of bacteria species and the severity of hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh scores; P more than 0.05). CONCLUSION: The total quantity of intestinal bacteria in patients with hepatic cirrhosis is not significantly different from that in healthy patients. However, the profile of intestinal bacteria is different, which may explain the increased pH of fecal samples from patients with hepatic cirrhosis, but the differential profile is not correlated to cirrhosis pathogenesis.
TI  - Dysbiosis of fecal microbiota in Crohn's disease patients as revealed by a custom phylogenetic microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A custom phylogenetic microarray composed of small subunit ribosomal  RNA probes, representing approximately 500 bacterial species from the human and animal gut, was developed and evaluated for analysis of gut microbial diversity using fecal samples from healthy subjects and Crohn's disease (CD) patients. METHODS: Oligonucleotide probes ( approximately 40 mer) used on the microarray were selected from published articles or designed with the "GoArray" microarray probe design program using selected bacterial 16S rRNA sequences. Fecal 16S rDNA from individual samples of six healthy subjects and six CD patients were used as template to generate fluorescently labeled cRNA that was hybridized to the microarray. Differences revealed by the microarray in relative abundance of microbial populations between healthy and diseased patients were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific primer sets. RESULTS: The microarray analyses showed that Eubacterium rectale, Bacteroides fragilis group, B. vulgatus, Ruminococcus albus, R. callidus, R. bromii, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were 5-10-fold more abundant in the healthy subjects than in the CD patients, while Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, Escherichia coli, Shigella flexneri, and Listeria sp. were more abundant in the CD group. CONCLUSIONS: The microarray detected differences in abundance of bacterial populations within the phylum Firmicutes that had been reported previously for the same samples based on phylogenetic analysis of metagenomic clone libraries. In addition, the microarray showed that Enterococcus sp. was in higher abundance in the CD patients. This microarray should be another useful tool to examine the diversity and abundance of human intestinal microbiota.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the digestive microbiota in a gnotobiotic mouse model during antibiotic treatment: Influence of Saccharomyces boulardii.
AB  - The probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is a non-pathogenic yeast that has been proven efficient in the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea and of Clostridium difficile associated colitis. We evaluated the influence of the administration of S. boulardii on the composition of the fecal microbiota in a human microbiota-associated mouse model. This evaluation was run before, during and after a 7-day oral treatment with amoxicillin clavulanic acid. Predominant groups of bacteria were quantified with fluorescence in situ hybridization combined with flow cytometry using group-specific 16S rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes designed for the Eubacteria, Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Clostridium histolyticum, Lactobacillus-Enterococcus and Enterobacteriaceae groups and Bifidobacterium species. S. boulardii did not quantitatively alter the total anaerobic microbiota nor the dominant bacterial groups. During the antibiotic treatment in the two groups of mice receiving the yeast or not, the level of Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides groups increased when the C. coccoides-E. rectale group decreased dramatically. After the antibiotic treatment was discontinued, the return to the initial level was reached more rapidly in the S. boulardii-treated mice than in the control mice (p<0.05) for the C. coccoides-E. rectale and Bacteroides-Porphyromonas-Prevotella groups. This quicker recovery of normal intestinal microbiota equilibrium after antibiotic therapy could be a mechanism for S. boulardii preventive effect on antibiotic-associated diarrhea in humans.
TI  - [Efficacy of tinidazole against anaerobes in comparison with metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and lamoxactam].
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory activity of tinidazole, metronidazole, ornidazole, cefoxitin and moxalactam was determined against 150 isolates of clinically important anaerobes including Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides bivius and Clostridium perfringens by means of agar dilution tests. The members of 18 gramnegative and 14 grampositive species were inhibited by tinidazole at less than or equal to 0,01-8 micrograms/ml thus being without exception susceptible to the drug. A similar in vitro activity was recorded for metronidazole and ornidazole. Though cefoxitin and moxalactam generally had a good in vitro activity against most anaerobic species, single strains of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. distasonis, Clostridium difficile and Eubacterium rectale were resistant to these drugs. With regard to its in vitro activity, tinidazole seems to be a promising substance for the therapy of anaerobic infections.
