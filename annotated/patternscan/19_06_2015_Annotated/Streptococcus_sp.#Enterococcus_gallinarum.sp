TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia.
AB  == background: multi-drug-resistant enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. the present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in jimma, ethiopia. methods: the study was conducted among hospitalized patients at jimma university specialized hospital, from january to july 2013. fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. stool samples were  inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (bile esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. the isolates were identified to genus and  species level by cultural characteristics, gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% nacl broth, growth at 45 degrees c, motility test and by using api 20 streptococcus system. sensitivity testing was done using kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using e-test strips. result: overall, enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. the isolates were enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and enterococcus durans (8.8%). among 114 tested enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of e. faecium and e. faecalis. vancomycin resistant enterococci were observed in 5% of  e. faecium isolates. conclusion: this study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities  is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.

TI  == immunomodulatory properties of streptococcus and veillonella isolates from the human small intestine microbiota.
AB  == the human small intestine is a key site for interactions between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal immune system. here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four streptococcus salivarius, one s. equinus, one s. parasanguinis) one veillonella parvula strain, one enterococcus gallinarum strain, and lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. the different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines il-8, tnf-alpha, and il-12p70, while the v. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce il-6. e. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and tlr2/6 signalling. as streptococcus and veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. a combination of (some) streptococci with veillonella appeared to negate il-12p70 production, while augmenting il-8, il-6, il-10, and tnf-alpha responses. this suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a pcr-based rapid screening method.
AB  == enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. this work reports the development of a pcr-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16s rrna sequence. published 16s rrna sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (entf and entr). the primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region  from enterococcus faecalis atcc 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11  different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (pediococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus and listeria) or species of escherichia coli and salmonella. the pcr positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by api 20 strep panels and sequencing. when dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 enterococcus strains (15 e. faecalis, 13 e. faecium, and one e. gallinarum) were identified. when susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). none was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. the molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant enterococcus species.

TI  == use of the phoenix automated system for identification of streptococcus and enterococcus spp.
AB  == the phoenix system (becton dickinson diagnostic systems, sparks, md) was evaluated for identification (id) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), enterococcus faecium (n = 36), enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). the api system (biomerieux, marcy l'etoile, france) was used as a comparator. molecular methods (sequencing of 16s rrna and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species id was achieved by the phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70  (90.0%) enterococci. excellent results were obtained for s. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). with regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the phoenix system was 83.9%. among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the streptococcus sanguinis group  and streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the streptococcus mitis group. four e. faecium and three e. faecalis isolates were misidentified as enterococcus casseliflavus/enterococcus gallinarum or enterococcus durans. thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. compared with commercially available systems, the phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. the smic/id-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.

TI  == granular layer in the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria and fine structures of enterococcus gallinarum and streptococcus gordonii septa revealed by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections.
AB  == high-resolution structural information on optimally preserved bacterial cells can be obtained with cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections. with the help of  this technique, the existence of a periplasmic space between the plasma membrane  and the thick peptidoglycan layer of the gram-positive bacteria bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus was recently shown. this raises questions about the mode of polymerization of peptidoglycan. in the present study, we report the structure of the cell envelope of three gram-positive bacteria (b. subtilis, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus gallinarum). in the three cases, a previously undescribed granular layer adjacent to the plasma membrane is found in the periplasmic space. in order to better understand how nascent peptidoglycan is incorporated into the mature peptidoglycan, we investigated cellular regions known to represent the sites of cell wall production. each of these sites possesses a specific structure. we propose a hypothetic model of peptidoglycan polymerization that accommodates these differences: peptidoglycan precursors could be exported from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space, where they could diffuse until they would interact with the interface between the granular layer and the thick peptidoglycan layer. they could then polymerize with mature peptidoglycan. we report cytoplasmic structures at the e. gallinarum septum that  could be interpreted as cytoskeletal elements driving cell division (ftsz ring).  although immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy studies have demonstrated the septal and cytoplasmic localization of ftsz, direct visualization of in situ ftsz filaments has not been obtained in any electron microscopy study of fixed and dehydrated bacteria.

TI  == cholesterol assimilation by lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria isolated from the human gut.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of human gut-derived lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria on cholesterol levels in vitro. continuous cultures inoculated with fecal material from healthy human volunteers  with media supplemented with cholesterol and bile acids were used to enrich for potential cholesterol assimilators among the indigenous bacterial populations. seven potential probiotics were found: lactobacillus fermentum strains f53 and kc5b, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, streptococcus bovis atcc 43143, enterococcus durans dsm 20633, enterococcus gallinarum, and enterococcus faecalis. a comparative evaluation regarding the in vitro cholesterol reduction abilities of these strains along with commercial probiotics was undertaken. the degree of acid and bile tolerance of strains was also evaluated. the human isolate l. fermentum kc5b was able to maintain viability for 2 h at ph 2 and to grow in a medium with 4,000 mg of bile acids per liter. this strain was also able to remove a maximum of 14.8 mg of cholesterol per g (dry weight) of cells from the culture medium and therefore was regarded as a candidate probiotic.

TI  == in vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, rwj-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. we compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, rwj-54428 (mc-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 enterococcus faecalis, 20 enterococcus faecium, 10 enterococcus gallinarum/enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 streptococcus  pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. the mic(90) of rwj-54,428 was  < or = 2 mg/l for all groups of bacteria tested except e. faecium. the activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/l).

TI  == composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  == aims: to identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tdna-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. methods and results: gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on columbia cna blood agar. sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while e. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates).  minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, streptococcus alactolyticus and strep. gallolyticus. contrary to the species description of e. columbae and e. cecorum,  some of the strains were found to be motile. certain other minor differences with the species description of e. columbae are also indicated. conclusions: enterococcus columbae is the major gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. the potentially pathogenic strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. enterococcus faecium and e.  faecalis are rare in pigeons. significance and impact of the study: the enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. these are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as  carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.

TI  == the duel study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the netherlands.
AB  == objective: to evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. methods: bacterial strains were isolated between september 1999 and january 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. the in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were obtained with the e test on mueller-hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. for vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 mcfarland  was used for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant  colonies. results: the values of mic90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as enterococcus  faecium, e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vana, vanc1 and vanc2/3 genes, respectively. nine per cent of streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermb and mefe type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. conclusion: linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci. cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.

TI  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of gram-positive aerobic clinical  isolates. mics were determined by an agar dilution method on mueller-hinton agar  (nccls/eucast) and on isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/l free calcium (bsac). both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. daptomycin mics for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and  methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/l. for 99 of the 100 enterococci (enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/l. for all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin mics were 0.016- 0.25 mg/l; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/l. for miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including lactobacillus spp., lactococcus spp., leuconostoc spp., pediococcus spp. and isolates of enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin mics were 0.03-2 mg/l; mics for the seven isolates of listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/l. there was little difference between the results on mueller-hinton agar and  on supplemented isotonic agar the discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented isotonic agar. daptomycin was active (mics < or = 2 mg/l) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of e. faecium and l. monocytogenes (mics = 4 mg/l). our results indicate that daptomycin mics are independent of methicillin and vancomycin mics.

TI  == evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor tu in enterococci.
AB  == the elongation factor tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a gtp binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. one to three tuf genes per genome are  present, depending on the bacterial species. most low-g+c-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. we have designed degenerate pcr primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. the amplified dna fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned  inserts containing putative amplicons. two different tuf genes (tufa and tufb) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including enterococcus avium, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus pseudoavium, and enterococcus raffinosus. for  the other six enterococcal species (enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus columbae,  enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sulfureus, enterococcus saccharolyticus, and  enterococcus solitarius), only the tufa gene was present. based on 16s rrna gene  sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. the presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by southern hybridization. phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufa gene branches with the bacillus, listeria, and staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufb gene clusters with the genera streptococcus and lactococcus. primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufb genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and lactococcus lactis. the data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally  transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.

TI  == identification of enterococcus species and phenotypically similar lactococcus and vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  == data from four recent studies (s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; s. h. goh et al., j. clin. microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; a. y. c. kwok et al., int. j. syst. bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region  of the chaperonin 60 (cpn60) gene, amplified by pcr with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (id). this cpn60 gene id method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. we report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 enterococcus species (enterococcus asini, enterococcus rattus, enterococcus dispar, enterococcus gallinarum, enterococcus hirae, enterococcus durans, enterococcus cecorum, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus malodoratus, enterococcus raffinosus, enterococcus avium, enterococcus pseudoavium, enterococcus new sp. strain facklam, and enterococcus saccharolyticus), and vagococcus fluvialis, lactococcus lactis, and lactococcus garvieae. from 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the facklam and collins phenotyping method (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the cpn60 id method. in each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the cpn60 id method. the species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were enterococcus new sp.  strain facklam (atcc 700913), 3; e. asini, 1; e. rattus, 4; e. dispar, 2; e. gallinarum, 20; e. hirae, 9; e. durans, 9; e. faecalis, 12; e. mundtii, 3; e. casseliflavus, 8; e. faecium, 25; e. malodoratus, 3; e. raffinosus, 8; e. avium,  4; e. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain r871;  vagococcus fluvialis, 4; lactococcus garvieae, 3; lactococcus lactis, 3; leuconostoc sp., 1; and pediococcus sp., 1. the cpn60 gene id method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of enterococcus and related organisms.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  == the recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. during a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a  variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (eva broth multiple tube test) used for public health purposes. the predominant species were enterococcus faecalis (39%)  and ent. faecium (29%), followed by ent. durans/hirae, ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. only one isolate was identified as belonging to the streptococcus genus. the authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. this may help  to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. all isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

TI  == [susceptibilities of enterococcus faecium, prsp and mrsa to rp59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  == investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the western countries, have been conducted in japan. a total of 1,239 isolates of e. faecium  were collected from 19 institutions during the period of april 1995 and june 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including rp59500 and vancomycin (vcm), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant  streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) were also studied. as a result, 2 isolates of e. faecium were found to be  moderately resistant to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by pcr method have not been completed. on the other hand there detected no mrsa nor prsp showing moderately resistant or resistant to vcm. it was concluded that rp59500 and vcm possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated e. faecium, prsp and mrsa. among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to vcm showing mic of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of e. gallinarum, 4 of  e. casseliflavus and 2 of e. flavescens. in those isolates, vanc1 and vanc2 were  detected by pcr, and vanb was also detected in a isolates of e. gallinarum simultaneously.

TI  == semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from ly264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  == certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic ly264826 with n-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. for enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin  and teicoplanin, the mics of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for ly264826. for e. faecium and e. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the mics were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. the compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against e. gallinarum and e. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. the mics for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. against methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis mics ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. the spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. the compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with mics of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. in in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, or s. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. overall, these new glycopeptides, such as ly307599 and ly333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

AB  == the use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. we isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus hirae, and enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other.  these bacteria were found in a variety of samples. enterococcus casseliflavus and enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. on the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein  profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as e. casseliflavus. lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile  groups which could not be identified with the aid of known aerococcus, enterococcus, lactococcus, or streptococcus strains. the maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.

TI  == [the effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  == some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. staphylococcus cohnii sc7, staphylococcus sp. ztj 151, s. saprophyticus ss 877, enterococcus faecium ef1 and e. faecalis efg2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves  and fallow deer, enterococcus gallinarum eg10 and e. avium ea12 were isolated from the caecum of japanese quail. the tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and  urease activity (tab. iii). these culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and vl agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (zag, zal, vlg, vll), agar for isolation  of faecal streptococci (sa) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (ka4, ka2). the strains streptococcus bovis ao 24/85 and staphylococcus aureus oxford 209 p were used as indicator bacteria. tables i and ii show the results of these  tests. the tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on sa medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. on zag medium, the zones of enterococci with the ao 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. all strains with the 209p indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. the larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the zal medium with the ao24/85 strain. the production of tested strains was balanced on vlg agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  == identification to species level showed that enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. two species, ent. faecium and streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. enterococcus hirae and ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. in layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, ent. cecorum dominated with strep. alactolyticus ranking next. other species were isolated irregularly. enterococcus avium and ent. gallinarum,  originally described from chickens, were rarely found. these species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.

TI  == synergistic killing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci of classes a, b, and c by combinations of vancomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin.
AB  == using both high and low inocula for time-kill curves, we examined the antibiotic  killing of clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (enterococcus  faecium, e. faecalis, and e. gallinarum) belonging to phenotypic resistance classes a, b, and c. none were resistant to high levels (greater than 500 mg/liter) of gentamicin. vancomycin-penicillin-gentamicin resulted in 2 or more logs of killing above that of the most effective two-antibiotic combination for all strains except two of three e. gallinarum (vanc) strains and a constitutive mutant of a vanb strain. this strategy may be useful clinically.

TI  == intrageneric relationships of enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rrna.
AB  == the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna) sequences of eleven enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. the species e. avium, e. malodoratus, e. pseudoavium and e. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did e. durans, e. faecium, e. hirae and e. mundtii and the pair of species e. casseliflavus and e. gallinarum. of the remaining species, e. cecorum, e. columbae, e. faecalis and e. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas e. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.

TI  == species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  == conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of facklam and collins (r. r. facklam and m. d. collins, j. clin. microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative enterococcus faecalis isolates as enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. the commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. e. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. enterococcus faecium (8.6%), enterococcus avium (0.7%), enterococcus durans (0.3%), enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. none of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of e. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.

TI  == enterococci highly resistant to penicillin and ampicillin: an emerging clinical problem?
AB  == sixteen clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant enterococci (are) were recovered from the microbiology laboratory of a 450-bed rehabilitation medical center from january 1981 to september 1987. these isolates were detected when a disk diffusion test using 10 micrograms of ampicillin on a blood agar plate revealed no zones of inhibition. tube macrodilution tests yielded an mic of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms of ampicillin per ml. none of the isolates were penicillinase producers by the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test. ten isolates were enterococcus faecium, four isolates were e. raffinosus, one isolate was e. gallinarum, and one isolate was not identified (lost). there were 6 male and 10 female patients. the sources of isolates were urine (n = 7), wound (n = 5), ascitic fluid (n = 2), blood (n = 2), peritoneal catheter tip (n = 1), bartholin's cyst abscess (n = 1), rectal swab (n = 2), and pancreatic abscess (n  = 1). the organism was isolated from multiple sites in 4 patients, was a pure culture isolate in 5 patients, and was part of a polymicrobial flora in 11 patients. six patients were diabetic, and four had liver cirrhosis. all but four  patients had received at least one antibiotic within 3 weeks of are isolation. the mics (micrograms per milliliter) for 50 and 90% of isolates tested, respectively, were as follows: ampicillin, 64 and 64; penicillin, 128 and greater than 128; vancomycin, 1 and 2; gentamicin, 4 and 16; ciprofloxacin, 1.6 and 3.2;  imipenem, 128 and greater than 128; and daptomycin (ly146032), 1.6 and 6.4. are may be an emerging pathogen in the hospitalized patient population.

TI  == the effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  == small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. the enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for ent. gallinarum. this apparent selection of ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. this was because this species was generally more resistant than ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the mls antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.

TI  == the effect of ampicillin and tylosin on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  == enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium and ent. gallinarum. the proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. this pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. a gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed'  control birds. this was associated with an increase in the proportion of ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.

TI  == use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  == the results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. durans, e. hirae, e. avium, e. gallinarum, e. casseliflavus, e. malodoratus and e. mundtii. each species had a specific pattern of at least five pbps, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kda. the pattern of pbps may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.

TI  == numerical taxonomy of streptococcus.
AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
