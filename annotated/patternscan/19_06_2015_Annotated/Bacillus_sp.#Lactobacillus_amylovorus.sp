TI  == potentialities of newly isolated bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus sp for curd  preparation and a comparative study of its physico-chemical parameters with other marketed curds.
AB  == two bacillus sp. were isolated from the local fermented milk and identified on the basis 16s rrna sequence profile as bacillus subtilis akl1 and by biochemical  process as lactobacillus acidophilus akl2. these isolates were used as fresh inoculums for curd preparation individually and in combinations. different physico-chemical and therapeutic properties of the newly prepared curd were examined and compared with marketed local (sweet and sour) and branded (mother dairy and thackar) curds. the total hydrolyzed peptides, free amino acids, lactic acid were significantly higher, whereas, total solid, ash content, syneresis and  free reducing sugar were lower in the curd prepared by a mixture of akl1 and akl2 (0.5:0.5, v/v). the antioxidant activity against abts+, dpph8, oh* and fe3+ were  also higher in the newly formulated curd. polyphenols (85.5 microg/g), flavonoids (12.5 microg/g) and free aromatic amino acids contents were also higher in akl1+akl2. all these components prevent excess protein oxidation that was revealed by sds-page. the curd also exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against some entero-pathogens like clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella dysentery, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus. it can be concluded that the combination of these lactobacillus sp. will be a fruitful inoculum for the preparation of curd having better health promoting effects.

TI  == compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d-alanine, l-alanine, and valine:  application of diastereomer separation to delta15n and microbial peptidoglycan studies.
AB  == we have developed an analytical method to determine the compound-specific nitrogen isotope compositions of individual amino acid enantiomers using gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. a novel derivatization of amino acid diastereomers by optically active (r)-(-)-2-butanol or (s)-(+)-2-butanol offers two advantages for nitrogen isotope analysis. first, chromatographic chiral separation can be achieved without the use of chiral stationary-phase columns. second, the elution order of these compounds on the chromatogram can be switched by a designated esterification reaction. we applied  the method to the compound-specific nitrogen isotope analysis of d- and l-alanine in a peptidoglycan derived from the cell walls of cultured bacteria (firmicutes and actinobacteria; enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus  staphylolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and streptomyces sp.), natural whole bacterial cells (bacillus subtilis var. natto), (pseudo)-peptidoglycan from archaea (methanobacterium sp.), and cell wall from eukaryota (saccharomyces cerevisiae). we observed statistically significant differences in nitrogen isotopic compositions; e.g., delta15n ( per thousand vs air) in staphylococcus staphylolyticus for d-alanine (19.2 +/- 0.5 per thousand, n = 4) and l-alanine (21.3 +/- 0.8 per thousand, n = 4) and in bacillus subtilis for d-alanine (6.2 +/- 0.2 per thousand, n = 3) and l-alanine (8.2 +/- 0.4 per thousand, n = 3). these results suggest that enzymatic reaction  pathways, including the alanine racemase reaction, produce a nitrogen isotopic difference in amino acid enantiomers, resulting in 15n-depleted d-alanine. this method is expected to facilitate compound-specific nitrogen isotope studies of amino acid stereoisomers.

TI  == inhibition of growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli by nonpathogenic escherichia coli.
AB  == during routine quality control testing of diagnostic methods for shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) using stool samples spiked with stec, it  was observed that the shiga toxin could not be detected in 32 out of 82 samples tested. strains of e. coli isolated from such stool samples were shown to be responsible for this inhibition. one particular isolate, named e. coli 1307, was  intensively studied because of its highly effective inhibitory effect; this strain significantly reduced growth and shiga toxin levels in coculture of several stec strains regardless of serovar or shiga toxin type. the probiotic e.  coli nissle 1917 inhibited growth and reduced shiga toxin levels in stec cultures to an extent similar to e. coli 1307, but commensal e. coli strains and several other known probiotic bacteria (enterococci, bacillus sp., lactobacillus acidophilus) showed no, or only small, inhibitory effects. escherichia coli 1307  lacks obvious fitness factors, such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, microcins and  a polysaccharide capsule, that are considered to promote the growth of pathogenic bacteria. we therefore propose strain e. coli 1307 as a candidate probiotic for use in the prevention and treatment of infections caused by stec.

TI  == molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by lactobacillus acidophilus aa11.
AB  == approximately 63 strains of lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. e. coli, salmonella sp. and shigella sp.). lactobacillus acidophilus aa11 produced higher  antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. the agent aa11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees c. activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. the compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% sds-page analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kda and approximately 29 kda. no plasmid was identified in lactobacillus acidophilus aa11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. these characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin aa11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.

TI  == culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the african traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different dna extraction methods.
AB  == the microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the rep. of congo) and degue (a millet dough from burkina faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using ttge to separate the amplified target v3 region of the 16s rrna gene from total microbial community, followed by dna sequencing and homology search. three different extraction methods were used. guanidium thiocyanate-based dna extraction provided better performance regarding  purity and dna yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of dna bands by ttge in poto poto. by contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the dna extraction method largely depends on the food composition. sequencing of dna bands from ttge gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of lactobacillus gasseri, enterococcus sp., escherichia coli, lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, bacillus sp., lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus casei. the following bacteria were identified in degue: l. gasseri, enterococcus sp., e. coli, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, and l. casei.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis induces inflammatory bowel disease in interleukin-10 knockout mice.
AB  == germ-free interleukin-10 knockout (il-10 ko) mice developed inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) after they were colonized with a pure culture of enterococcus faecalis. e. faecalis not only induced ibd (primarily in colon and rectum) but rectal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma was also found in the il-10 ko mice. conventional (complex-intestinal flora) il-10 ko mice developed ibd within 10 to  15 weeks of age and showed more pathology in the cecum (typhlitis) than we observed with e. faecalis-induced ibd in gnotobiotic il-10 ko mice. conversely, neither germ-free il-10 mice nor il-10 ko mice colonized as adults, with a pure culture of candida albicans, escherichia coli, lactobacillus casei, l. reuteri, l. acidophilus, a bifidobacterium sp., lactococcus lactis, or a bacillus sp. developed ibd during the 25- to 30-week study. e. faecalis is a common intestinal microbe of man and animals that can trigger ibd, dysplasia, and carcinoma in a genetically susceptible murine host.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of lactobacillus acidophilus lf221.
AB  == lactobacillus acidophilus lf221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: bacillus cereus, clostridium sp., listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus d. l. acidophilus lf221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin lf221 a and acidocin lf221 b, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase fplc. the  antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase k) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide a and 35 of peptide b were determined. among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. no significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin lf221 a and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology  was found between acidocin lf221 b and brevicin 27. l. acidophilus lf221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.

TI  == in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  == in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the  ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the  serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.

TI  == effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  == postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (g), galactose (gal), l-lactic acid (la) and amino-n (an) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) sporolactobacillus p44 (sp), or 10(6) cfu bacillus cereus ip5832 (ac), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of  lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis (ab)/g feed. sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (sd 2) kg) were used. the diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300  g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). the postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (bd) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (sp, ac and ab respectively). areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (apacd) of g, gal and la were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. apacd of an was significantly higher after the ingestion of the sp diet than that estimated for bd.

TI  == effect of saccharin on growth and acid production of glucose-grown pathogenic and oral bacteria.
AB  == growth and acid production of glucose-grown gram-positive and gram-negative rods  as well as cocci from the human oral cavity were studied in the presence of 0.02  to 20.00 mg/ml sodium saccharin. all gram-positive rods, i.e. actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bacillus subtilis and corynebacterium diphtheriae, and gram-positive cocci, i.e. streptococcus spp, staphylococcus aureus and micrococcus luteus, were significantly inhibited by saccharin, especially at the higher concentrations. while gram-negative cocci, i.e. veillonella sp and neisseria sicca were strongly inhibited by all tested saccharin concentrations, gram-negative rods, i.e. the enterics and acinetobacter sp, exhibited little if any inhibition. saccharin caused a significant reduction  in fermentative acid production congruent with observed growth.
