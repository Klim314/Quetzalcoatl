TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women.
AB  == background: the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina in male-to-female transsexuals is a recently created microbial niche which thus far has been characterized only to a very limited extent. yet the knowledge of this microflora can be considered as essential to the follow-up of transsexual women. the primary objective of this study was to map the neo-vaginal microflora in a group of 50 transsexual women for whom a neovagina was constructed by means of the inverted penile skin flap technique. secondary objectives were to describe possible correlations of this microflora with multiple patients' characteristics, such as  sexual orientation, the incidence of vaginal irritation and malodorous vaginal discharge. results: based on gram stain the majority of smears revealed a mixed microflora that had some similarity with bacterial vaginosis (bv) microflora and  that contained various amounts of cocci, polymorphous gram-negative and gram-positive rods, often with fusiform and comma-shaped rods, and sometimes even with spirochetes. candida cells were not seen in any of the smears. on average 8.6 species were cultured per woman. the species most often found were: staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus anginosus group spp., enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium sp., mobiluncus curtisii and bacteroides ureolyticus. lactobacilli were found in only one of 30 women. there was no correlation between dilatation habits, having coitus, rinsing habits and malodorous vaginal discharge on the one hand and the presence of a particular species on the other. there was  however a highly significant correlation between the presence of e. faecalis on the one hand and sexual orientation and coitus on the other (p = 0.003 and p = 0.027 respectively). respectively 82%, 58% and 30% of the samples showed an amplicon after amplification with m. curtisii, atopobium vaginae and gardnerella  vaginalis primer sets. conclusion: our study is the first to describe the microflora of the penile skin-lined neovagina of transsexual women. it reveals a  mixed microflora of aerobe and anaerobe species usually found either on the skin, in the intestinal microflora or in a bv microflora.

TI  == a retrospective analysis of isolates from patients with vaginitis in a private greek obstetric/gynecological hospital (2003-2006).
AB  == background: vaginitis is a common cause of complaints in women in various parts of the world. through our literature search, we identified noteworthy differences in the etiology of vaginitis based on the geographic location. this study was conducted to describe microbial etiology in a population of symptomatic women with vaginitis in greece. material/methods: data for pathogens isolated from cultures of vaginal fluid specimens or identified with microscopy testing of such specimens of women with symptomatic vaginitis who were examined at "lito" private obstetric/gynecological hospital, athens, greece, during the period 1/2003-12/2006 were analyzed retrospectively. results: during this period, 1632 women were examined. the mean age of the patients was 28 years, ranging from 18 to 57 years. three hundred and eighty five from 1632 cultures/tests contributed no pathogen, whereas 1247/1632 cultures/tests were positive. of the isolates, in  which twelve species were identified, 504 (40.4%) were gardnerella vaginalis, 530 (42.5%) candida spp, and 101 (8.1%) trichomonas vaginalis. less usual isolates were escherichia coli, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus spp., streptococcus viridans, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus spp., and staphylococcus saprophyticus. conclusions: the authors believe that this study adds to the relevant literature of information regarding the pathogens implicated in patients with symptomatic vaginitis by reporting data from a cohort of patients in greece. ninety-one percent of the isolated and identified pathogens from vaginal cultures of symptomatic greek women included candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and  trichomonas vaginalis, with the first two species representing the great majority.

TI  == bacteriological epidemiology and treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == one hundred symptomatic women with clinical bacterial vaginosis (bv) were enrolled in this study. the bacteriological epidemiology of bv and efficacy of oral or vaginal administration of antimicrobial agents for treatment of bv were investigated. the epidemiology of bv was investigated before antimicrobial therapy. fifty patients were treated with oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and 50 patients with 2% clindamycin (cldm) phosphate in a vaginal cream, 5 g once a day for 7 days. the major organisms occurring were streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides species, prevotella species, and mobiluncus species and opportunistic pathogens such as staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis. the therapeutic efficacy of cldm cream on bv appeared  to be preferable to oral mtn from clinical and bacteriological aspects. the clinical and bacteriological effectiveness of mtn and cldm in the treatment of bv suggests that anaerobes might play a major role in causing the clinical symptoms  in patients with bv.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk037, a new parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin, against recent clinical isolates in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a new parenteral cephalosporin, fk037 was assessed  against recent aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated from patients in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology during the period between january 1992 and june 1993. the mics of fk037 for 90% of the clinical isolates tested were 0.10 microgram/ml for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, 0.20 microgram/ml for streptococcus agalactiae, 0.39 microgram/ml for gardnerella vaginalis, 0.78 microgram/ml for staphylococcus epidermidis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and mobiluncus spp., 1.56 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus magnus, 3.13 micrograms/ml for methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, 25 micrograms/ml for methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), bacteroides fragilis and prevotella disiens, 100 micrograms/ml for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and prevotella bivia; and > 100 micrograms/ml for enterococcus faecalis. fk037 was superior in potency  to ceftazidime against all strains except e. faecalis, p. anaerobius and p. bivia. it was 4- to 16-fold more active than cefotaxime against aerobic gram-positive bacteria and p. disiens, and its activity was similar to that of cefotaxime against the other strains. fk037 had 4- to 16-fold stronger activity than flomoxef against mrsa, s. agalactiae and e. coli and a similar activity to flomoxef against the other strains except g. vaginalis and b. fragilis that were  4-fold more sensitive to flomoxef than to fk037.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine gluconate douche on normal vaginal flora.
AB  == the effects of a 0.5% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate (chg) douche on the normal  vaginal flora of twenty healthy nonpregnant volunteers were investigated. the douche was applied in a premeasured 180-ml quantity daily for 7 consecutive days. specimens for aerobic and anaerobic culture of the vaginal flora were obtained on 3 occasions from each volunteer, once before and twice after chg use. the culture results were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. a blood sample was also collected within 24 h of the last chg application to determine serum chg concentration. lactobacillus spp., gardnerella vaginalis and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most prevalent aerobic bacteria at all phases of the study and bacteroides spp. were the most prevalent anaerobes. the composition of the normal flora was essentially the same 30 days after the last dose as the pretreatment flora. small amounts of chg were detected in the serum of all but one subject. no untoward effects on the participants were observed. candida albicans counts were slightly higher, but prevalence was not significantly increased at the end of the study.

TI  == susceptibility of female pelvic pathogens to oral antibiotic agents in patients who develop postpartum endometritis.
AB  == fifteen hundred patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study on the  effect of antibiotic prophylaxis during cesarean section. two hundred thirty-one  patients developed postpartum endometritis, and the isolates obtained from the endometrium were tested for sensitivity to ampicillin, cefuroxime, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. minimum inhibitory concentrations of 50% and 90%  of ampicillin, cefuroxime, and clindamycin were similar to previously reported values; however, slight differences were noted in the activity of the two quinolones to common pelvic isolates. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 90% of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin to 119 isolates of enterococcus faecalis were  4.0 and 2.0, to 17 isolates of staphylococcus aureus 1.0 and 0.5, to 39 isolates  of escherichia coli 0.5 and 1.0, to 46 isolates of bacteroides bivius 4.0 and 8.0, to 57 isolates of gardnerella vaginalis 1.0 and 2.0, to 71 isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis 0.5 and 0.5, to 16 isolates of proteus mirabilis 0.25  and 0.12, and to 50 isolates of lactobacillus species 32.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. in summary, the quinolones have activity comparable with a variety  of other oral agents versus female pelvic pathogens, with the quinolones ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin having better activity against most of the gram-negative isolates. anaerobic activities were comparable with the beta-lactams, but inferior to clindamycin and metronidazole as expected.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole  against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (bv) or skin infections by agar dilution mic determinations. bv-associated bacteroides isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus-b. oralis group, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but bacteroides spp. not associated with bv, bacteroides ureolyticus and the bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. all bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of g. vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. varied. among the skin bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. this antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == evaluation of a fluorescent monoclonal antibody reagent for identification of cultured neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == we evaluated a new fluorescent monoclonal antibody reagent for confirmation of identity of neisseria gonorrhoeae. the reagent correctly identified all 161 fresh clinical isolates of n. gonorrhoeae, which included 11 penicillinase producing strains (ppng). the reagent also correctly identified 21 stored ppng strains. no  cross reactions were seen with 58 fresh clinical isolates of n. meningitidis, 12  stored strains of n. lactamica, or with strains of gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, candida spp., staphylococcus epidermidis or enterobacteriaceae. some cross reaction was noted with strains of s. aureus, probably related to cell-wall protein. a. however, this reagent was highly sensitive and specific for use against oxidase positive, gram-negative cocci isolated in london.

TI  == incidence of motile, curved anaerobic rods (mobiluncus species) in vaginal secretions.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures as well as a gram stain and wet mount preparation  were made of vaginal swabs taken from various groups of women including those with vaginal discharge. the bacteria commonly found in cultures were lactobacilli, coryneforms, staphylococcus epidermidis and facultative streptococci. anaerobes were isolated from 75% (475 of 632) of specimens. the incidence of trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus species in the five groups of women varied from 2.2-5.1%, 11.5-35.7%,  23.3-36.7% and 20.0-34.8% respectively. except for candida species, differences in the prevalence of these organisms between the groups of women were not significant. the isolation rates of candida species in women attending the antenatal clinic and staff health clinic were significantly higher than women in  the other groups. mobiluncus species were found to occur either with t. vaginalis, candida species or g. vaginalis alone or with any two or with all three or in the absence of these organisms. however, the incidence of mobiluncus  species was significantly higher in women colonized with g. vaginalis (112 of 185, or 60.5%) compared with women not infected (47 of 477, or 9.8%). also, mobiluncus species occurred in large numbers when found in the presence of g. vaginalis. when found without g. vaginalis, mobiluncus species occurred in much smaller numbers. as with g. vaginalis, mobiluncus species also occurred concomitantly with certain anaerobes, mainly bacteroides species and peptostreptococci.

TI  == polymicrobial early postpartum endometritis with facultative and anaerobic bacteria, genital mycoplasmas, and chlamydia trachomatis: treatment with piperacillin or cefoxitin.
AB  == a protected, triple-lumen transcervical culture method was used to recover organisms from the endometrium. at least one facultative or one anaerobic species of bacteria was recovered from 82% of the patients, and genital mycoplasmas were  recovered from 76% of the women with endometritis. bacteria together with genital mycoplasmas were present in 61% of the women, bacteria alone were present in 20%, genital mycoplasmas alone were present in 16%, and chlamydia trachomatis was isolated from 2% of the patients. the most common organisms included gardnerella  vaginalis, peptococcus spp., bacteroides spp., staphylococcus epidermidis, group  b streptococcus, and ureaplasma urealyticum. a randomized, double-blind regimen of either piperacillin or cefoxitin was equally successful in treating the postpartum endometritis.

TI  == clinical comparison of an agar slide blood culture bottle with tryptic soy broth  and a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth.
AB  == the roche septi-chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. both systems were inoculated  with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. more clinically important bacteria and fungi, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans and c. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (p less than 0.001). in contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and gardnerella vaginalis (p less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. staphylococci (p less than 0.01), enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli (p less than 0.05), and fungi (p less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (p less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. the overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. for optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.

TI  == quantitative bacteriology of the vaginal flora in genital disease.
AB  == samples from the posterior vaginal fornix of 102 women with various clinical conditions were analysed by a quantitative method. aerobes were isolated from all but one of the specimens at a mean concentration of 7.2 log10 cfu/g and anaerobes from 92 specimens at a mean concentration of 8.1 log10 cfu/g. in most clinical conditions and in a control group of asymptomatic women, anaerobes outnumbered aerobes by about ten to one (one log10 unit). the most common organisms were aerobic and anaerobic lactobacilli, coryneforms, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides spp. and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. lactobacilli did not appear to confer any protective effect by excluding the presence of other organisms such as gardnerella vaginalis or anaerobes. the isolation of anaerobic organisms from  the vagina cannot be regarded as being of pathogenic significance without other supporting evidence.
