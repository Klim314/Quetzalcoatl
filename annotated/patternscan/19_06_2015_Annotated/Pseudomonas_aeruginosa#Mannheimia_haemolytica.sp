TI  == the ompa family of proteins: roles in bacterial pathogenesis and immunity.
AB  == the ompa family of outer membrane proteins is a group of genetically related, heat-modifiable, surface-exposed, porin proteins that are in high-copy number in  the outer membrane of mainly gram-negative bacteria. ompa proteins are characterized by an n-terminal domain that forms an eight-stranded, anti-parallel beta barrel, which is embedded in the outer membrane. the c-terminal domain is globular and located in the periplasmic space. escherichia coli ompa is the best  characterized of the proteins. other well-characterized ompa-equivalent proteins  from pathogenic bacteria include pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf, haemophilus influenzae p5, klebsiella pneumoniae ompa, and chlamydia trachomatis major outer  membrane protein (momp). ompa from the veterinary pathogens mannheimia haemolytica, haemophilus parasuis, leptospira interrogans, and pasteurella multocida have been studied to a lesser extent. among many of the pathogenic bacteria, ompa proteins have important pathogenic roles including bacterial adhesion, invasion, or intracellular survival as well as evasion of host defenses or stimulators of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. these pathogenic roles are most commonly associated with central nervous system, respiratory and urogenital diseases. alternatively, ompa family proteins can serve as targets of  the immune system with immunogenicity related to surface-exposed loops of the molecule. in several cases, ompa proteins are under evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial pathogens against lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin g/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin g/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) as determined in the bft-germvet monitoring program 2004-2006.
AB  == a total of 368 bacterial pathogens, including 72 coagulase-positive and coagulase-variable staphylococci, 97 beta-haemolytic streptococci, 51 escherichia coli, 75 pasteurella multocida, 25 mannheimia haemolytica, 25 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 23 arcanobacterium pyogenes, were investigated for their susceptibility to the three combinations of antimicrobial agents lincomycin/spectinomycin (1/2), penicillin g/neomycin (1/1), and penicillin g/dihydrostreptomycin (1/1) in comparison to their susceptibility to the corresponding single substances. when comparing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) determined for any of the three combinations with those for the single substances, the lowest mic of one of the two substances usually determined the mic of the combination.this observation was made for all three combinations and all bacterial pathogens tested.thus, it is assumed that the combination of lincomycin with spectinomycin as well as that of penicillin with either neomycin or dihydrostreptomycin resulted in an extended spectrum of target bacterial pathogens rather than in an increase in antimicrobial efficacy.

TI  == contagious caprine pleuropneumonia and mannheimia haemolytica-associated acute respiratory disease of goats and sheep in afar region, ethiopia.
AB  == in april 2002, an investigation into an outbreak of acute respiratory disease in  goats and sheep in milae (afar), ethiopia was conducted. the investigation involved 4 flocks (722 sheep and 750 goats in total) and comprised the disease history, clinical and post-mortem examination, and microbiological analysis of nasal swabs, lung lesions, and pleural fluid samples. clinically diseased animals exhibited severe respiratory distress, and necropsy of two of the goats demonstrated fibrinous pneumonia, lung sequestra, and excessive accumulation of straw coloured fluid in the thoracic cavity. mannheimia haemolytica biotype t was isolated from nine (six goats and three sheep) out of 23 nasal swabs (39.1%). in  the two necropsied animals mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae (mccp) was isolated from the lungs, and mannheimia haemolytica biotype t was isolated from lung lesions and thoracic fluid. an unidentified mycoplasma species was isolated from the thoracic fluid of one of the goats. pseudomonas aeruginosa was  isolated from a lung sequestrum of one of the necropsied goats. in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results indicated that two (33.3%) of the six m. haemolytica isolates that were tested were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin g, three (50%) to tetracycline, four (66.7%) to oxacillin, five (83.3%) to erythromycin, and six (100%) to clindamycin. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to all of the different classes of antimicrobials that were tested. pleuropneumonia caused by mccp, and secondary complications caused by m. haemolytica and the other unidentified mycoplasma species, were confirmed as the  cause of the outbreak. morbidity was not associated with the species of animals affected (p > 0.05); however, mortality was significantly higher in goats than sheep (p < 0.05).

TI  == cellular distribution of anionic antimicrobial peptide in normal lung and during  acute pulmonary inflammation.
AB  == anionic peptides (aps) are small antimicrobial peptides present in human and ovine lung. in this study aps were also detected in bovine lung, and production of aps in lungs with acute inflammation induced by various stimuli was determined. the distribution and intensity of aps were determined by immunohistochemistry in lungs of 1) neonatal calves (1-3 days of age) inoculated  with mannheimia (pasteurella) haemolytica, a known inducer of the bovine beta-defensin lingual antimicrobial peptide (lap) or pyrogen-free saline (pfs), and 2) growing calves (3 months of age) similarly inoculated with m. haemolytica, a lipopolysaccharide (lps) from m. haemolytica, an lps-associated protein from m. haemolytica, or pfs. aps were also detected by western blots with the same antibody in lungs of the calves above, as well as in calves inoculated with pseudomonas aeruginosa, and an adult cow. anionic peptide (ap) immunoreactivity was detected in bands (approximate weights) in the western blots of lung at 28-30 (strongest signal), 31, 45, and 52-60 kd regardless of inoculum. the adult cow lacked bands at 45 kd, but it had additional bands at 64 (inconsistently) and 35-38 kd. all these band sizes are consistent with those of the western blots of  human and ovine lung. the cellular distribution of aps in lung of neonatal and growing cattle was similar to that in lung of human and sheep. in lungs with acute inflammation induced by live bacteria, lps, or protein, ap distribution and intensity were similar to those in control (pfs-inoculated) lungs and slightly decreased in bronchioles. this work demonstrates that ap is present in lung of cattle and is thereby conserved among two ruminant species and man. distribution  and intensity of ap production are not enhanced by infection or acute inflammation and are decreased in bronchioles, which suggests that ap is not induced like beta-defensins such as lap, but, instead, is produced constitutively.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == anionic antimicrobial peptide-lysozyme interactions in innate pulmonary immunity.
AB  == the respiratory tract contains numerous antimicrobial factors necessary for normal innate pulmonary defense. although many of these molecules reside in airway surface liquid (asl) simultaneously, little information exists concerning  antagonistic, additive, or synergistic interactions. since both cationic lysozyme and anionic antimicrobial peptides (ap) are found in high concentrations in asl,  the purpose of this study was to assess any interaction that might affect antimicrobial activity. for this, pasteurella haemolytica, micrococcus lysodeikticus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa were added to egg white lysozyme (3.9-250.0 microg/ml) or human neutrophil lysozyme (0.8-50.0 microg/ml) and h-gaddddd-oh (from 0.01 to 0.50 mm) mixtures in 50, 100, or 150 mm nacl; incubated for 2 h; and then plated. in this assay, the mics of ap for p. haemolytica, m. lysodeikticus, and p. aeruginosa varied slightly depending upon the concentration of nacl and mics generally increased slightly with increasing nacl concentrations. the mic of lysozyme for p. haemolytica and m. lysodeikticus  also increased slightly with increasing nacl concentrations. the mic of lysozyme  for p. aeruginosa was greater than 50 microg/ml and did not vary with increasing  nacl concentrations. when ap was combined with lysozyme in 50, 100, or 150 mm nacl concentrations, there was no significant interaction that affected antimicrobial activity. in conclusion, the mics of ap generally increased with increasing nacl concentrations but lysozyme and ap appeared not to interact significantly at physiologically relevant concentrations.

TI  == bacterial identity and characteristics in healthy and unhealthy respiratory tracts of sheep and calves.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare different bacteriological aspects of the respiratory systems of healthy (h) versus unhealthy (uh) animals with respiratory signs. the prevalence of different bacterial species was determined in the upper  and lower respiratory tract of h and uh najdi sheep, somali sheep and holstein calves. the characteristics of pasteurella spp. isolates, and the biotype of pasteurella haemolytica were identified in h and uh animals, eighteen out of 28 (64.3%) of the identified bacterial species in the upper respiratory tract were more prevalent in the nasal cavities of uh najdi and somali sheep and holstein calves with respiratory signs than in apparently healthy animals; four of the most prevalent bacteria in the upper respiratory system of uh sheep were moraxella spp., pseudomonas pseudomallei, erysipelothrix spp., pasteurella multocida, while three of the most prevalent bacteria in uh calves were pasteurella haemolytica, actinomyces spp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the prevalence of six different bacterial species was greater in the lungs of uh animals, namely actinomyces pyogenes, erysipelothrix spp., p. haemolytica, pasteurella ureae, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis, which could be risk factors in the complexity of the prevalent respiratory diseases of  the animals surveyed. of the biochemical, cytological and colonial characteristics studied in the identified p. haemolytica and p. multocida, two characters were significantly different (p < 0.05) in organisms isolated from uh  as compared to those from h animals. these were the higher loss of haemolytic power by the strains of p. haemolytica and the decreased fermentation of trehalose by all the strains of p. multocida recovered from healthy animals. the  only biotype of p. haemolytica isolated from h animals was biotype a, while both  biotypes a (88.0% of the isolates) and t (12.0% of the isolates) were recovered from uh animals.

TI  == evidence of bovine immunoglobulin g1 (igg1) protease activity in partially purified culture supernate of pasteurella haemolytica a1.
AB  == in the bovine respiratory tract, igg1 is a major secretory immunoglobulin (ig), and both igg1 and igg2 are believed to be important in defense against pneumonic  pasteurellosis (shipping fever) in calves. here we provide evidence for hydrolysis of igg1 in the presence of partially purified culture supernate (ppcs) from the respiratory pathogen pasteurella haemolytica a1. bovine igg1 was hydrolysed sequentially into three distinct bands (approximately 39, 12, and 7 kda respectively). furthermore, partial hydrolysis of bovine igg2 was observed, but neither bovine iga nor igm were affected by incubation with ppcs. these findings suggest that the production of an igg1-specific protease by p. haemolytica a1 may be a virulence mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis.

TI  == functional analysis of the bacillus subtilis purt gene encoding formate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase.
AB  == the purt gene from bacillus subtilis encoding the formate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase t was cloned by functional complementation of an escherichia coli purn purt double mutant. the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 384 amino acids. the purt amino acid sequence showed similarity to the enzyme phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase encoded by the  purk gene but not to the n10-formyltetrahydrofolate-dependent glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase n enzyme encoded by the purn gene. the glycinamide  ribonucleotide transformylase t level was repressed in cells grown in rich medium compared to minimal-medium-grown cells. however, when the culture entered the stationary-growth phase the enzyme level increased in rich medium and decreased in minimal medium. by comparing the deduced amino acid sequence of the b. subtilis purt gene product with translated nucleotide sequences in various databanks, evidence for the existence of putative purt genes in the gram-negative bacteria pasteurella haemolytica and pseudomonas aeruginosa was obtained.

TI  == further characterization of pasteurella haemolytica-like bacteria isolated from swine enteritis.
AB  == dna-dna hybridization studies were conducted on six pasteurella haemolytica-like  (phl) organisms recovered from cases of swine enteritis. chromosomal-enriched fractions of phl organisms served as the source of dna for southern blots or as whole-chromosomal dna probes. under stringent hybridization conditions, chromosomal dna probes of a prototype phl (strain 6213a) organism distinguished other phl organisms from pasteurella haemolytica types a1 and t3, pasteurella multiocida types a:1 and a:3, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae type 1, and salmonella cholerasuis. the guanine-cytosine content of the dna of three phl strains was 41.2 to 42.8 mol % as calculated from the thermal denaturation midpoint temperatures. the phl strains are gram-negative, nonmotile, beta-hemolytic, pleomorphic, oxidase-positive, urease- and indole-negative, fermentative rods with the key characteristics of the species pasteurella haemolytica. none of the phl strains reacted with the type-specific antisera of p. haemolytica types 1 through 12 as tested by an agglutination procedure. these swine strains differed in their biochemical differentiation from p. haemolytica types a1 and t3 in that all produced acid from m-inositol and failed to grow on macconkey agar. acid production from trehalose and l-arabinose was variable with phl strains. leukotoxicity of phl strains was evaluated by a colorimetric micro-titration assay. sterile culture supernatants of three of five phl strains were toxic to bovine neutrophils. results of these studies suggest that the phl organisms may belong to a new group of organisms under the genus pasteurella.

TI  == ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae by normal serum.
AB  == pulmonary surfactant has been shown to play an increasingly important role in bacterial clearance at the alveolar surface in the lung. this study describes a bactericidal mechanism in which ovine pulmonary surfactant induces killing of pasteurella haemolytica by normal serum. to demonstrate killing, six bacterial species were incubated first with pulmonary surfactant for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then with serum for an additional 60 min at 37 degrees c. p. haemolytica type a1 strains 82-25 and l101, a p. haemolytica type 2 strain, escherichia coli, and  klebsiella pneumoniae were susceptible and pasteurella multocida, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not susceptible to killing by ovine pulmonary surfactant and normal serum. no bacteria incubated with bovine pulmonary surfactant were killed by normal serum. although the species origin of  pulmonary surfactant was selective, the species origin of serum was not. p. haemolytica incubated with ovine pulmonary surfactant was killed by fetal calf serum, gnotobiotic calf serum, pooled normal sheep serum, pooled normal rabbit serum, and pooled guinea pig serum. ultrastructurally, killed p. haemolytica suspensions contained dead cells and cells distorted with vacuoles between the cytoplasmic membrane and the cytoplasm. the mechanism of killing did not correlate with concentrations of complement or lysozyme or titers of residual antibody in either the pulmonary surfactant or the serum, and killing was reduced by preincubation of surfactant with p. haemolytica lipopolysaccharide. preliminary characterization of both surfactant and serum implicate a low-molecular-weight proteinaceous component in the surfactant and serum albumin  in the serum. this mechanism may help clear certain gram-negative bacteria from the lungs of sheep as a part of the pulmonary innate defense system.

TI  == optimal conditions for the analysis of pasteurella haemolytica lipopolysaccharide by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the optimal conditions for the analysis of the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of two serotype a1 isolates and a serotype a2 isolate of pasteurella haemolytica by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and silver  staining were determined. the lps of the a1 isolates possessed o side chains, consisting of high molecular mass bands with the appearance of a ladder-like pattern, as well as a low molecular mass core-oligosaccharide region; the lps of  the a2 isolate consisted only of the core-oligosaccharide region. furthermore, the lps of the two a1 isolates differed in the core-oligosaccharide region. optimal resolution of low molecular mass lps components was obtained in a 15% acrylamide resolving gel containing 4 m urea whereas optimal resolution of high molecular mass components was obtained when urea was omitted. conventional silver staining resulted in excellent visualisation of lps bands, whereas a modified staining method did not detect additional bands, as has been demonstrated with the lps of pseudomonas aeruginosa. proteinase k digestion of outer membranes gave more clearly defined lps profiles than did similar digestions of whole cells, and more closely resembled the profiles of purified lps. with the exception of slight variation in the average molecular mass of a group of o side chains between logarithmic and stationary phases there were no differences in lps profiles at various stages of the growth cycle; freezing and thawing of lps samples had no effect on the profiles.
