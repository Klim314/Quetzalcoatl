TI  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 lactobacillus and three bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (ph 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; cfs) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; cfw) from de man-rogosa-sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. acid cfs and cfw showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against c. albicans. neutralized cfs/cfw assays showed six strains active against s. aureus (l. acidophilus l-1, l. brevis 1, l. fermentum 1, b. animalis subsp. lactis l-3), e. coli (l. bulgaricus 6) or b. cereus (l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic). inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized cfs (l. bulgaricus 6, l. helveticus 3, l. plantarum 24-2l, l. fermentum 1)/cfw (l. plantarum 24-5d, l. plantarum 24-4capital ve, cyrillic) was detected. some strains maintained activity after ph neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. the antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were  determined by the epsilometer test method. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (l. rhamnosus lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (l. acidophilus l-1 and l. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; l.  casei l-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). vancomycin mics > 256 mug/ml indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. the antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance  transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.

TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus spp. isolated from brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  == twelve lactobacillus isolates from brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. the strains were identified by 16s rdna  sequencing as lactobacillus plantarum (7), lb. brevis (2), lb. casei (2) and lb.  parabuchneri (1). all strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. only five strains of lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. all lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge dpph radical. beta-galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 miller units.  inhibition of food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. the lactobacillus strains from brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains lb. brevis sm-b and lb. plantarum  sm-i. both presented high acid tolerance. in addition, lb. brevis sm-b also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and lb. plantarum sm-i was the highest  beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.

TI  == partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  == the probiotic characteristics of lactobacillus brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33, isolated from traditional turkish tulum cheese were assessed. these two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg ml(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg ml(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at ph 2. they were also adhered to caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to escherichia coli lmg3083 (etec) and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. the strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature,  and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. the bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. tricine-sds-page of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kda and 2.7 kda for lb. brevis bg18 and lb. plantarum bg33 bacteriocins, respectively.

TI  == bacterial species associated with traditional starter cultures used for fermented bamboo shoot production in manipur state of india.
AB  == soidon is a non-salted acidic fermented food prepared from the succulent bamboo shoot tip of schizostachyum capitatum munro by using a traditional liquid starter called "soidon mahi" in manipur state of india. in this study, 163 bacterial isolates associated with this starter samples were identified and their population distribution was investigated by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 16s rdna sequencing and randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis. this acidic starter (ph 4.5+/-0.15) was dominated by a characteristic association of bacillus and lactic acid bacteria (lab) together. the population distribution of dominant species were bacillus subtilis 29.3%, bacillus cereus 35.7%, bacillus pumilus 2.6%, lactobacillus brevis 9.6%, lactobacillus plantarum 5.1%, carnobacterium sp. 11.9%, enterococcus faecium 1.2% and pseudomonas fluorescens 4.6%. alarming population load (10(6)-10(7)cfu/ml) of b. cereus in 87% of starter samples studied should raise concern regarding biosafety of soidon consumption. pcr amplification of 16s-23s rdna intergenic transcribed spacer (its) region and its-rflp profiles revealed a high diversity with eight subgroups in b. subtilis, five subgroups in b. cereus and three subgroups in l. brevis isolates. the most abundant b. subtilis subgroup ib.1 distributed in most of the samples showed very less clonal variability during rapd analysis. the molecular methods used in this study identified the dominant strains of bacillus and lab distributed in most of the starter samples. these dominant strains of b. subtilis, l. brevis and l. plantarum would allow for developing a defined starter culture for the production of quality soidon.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria and yeasts associated with spontaneous fermentations during  the production of sour cassava starch in brazil.
AB  == sour cassava starch is a traditional fermented food used in the preparation of fried foods and baked goods such as traditional cheese breads in brazil. thirty samples of sour cassava starch were collected from two factories in the state of  minas gerais. the samples were examined for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, mesophilic microorganisms, bacillus cereus and faecal coliforms. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolates were identified by biochemical tests, and the identities were confirmed by molecular methods. lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus fermentum were the prevalent lactic acid bacteria in product from both factories, at numbers between 6.0 and 9.0 log cfu g(-)(1). lactobacillus perolans and lactobacillus brevis were minor fractions of the population. galactomyces geothricum and issatchenkia sp. were the prevalent yeasts at numbers of 5.0 log cfu g(-)(1). a species similar to candida ethanolica was frequently isolated from one factory. mesophilic bacteria and amylolytic microorganisms were recovered in high numbers at all stages of the fermentation. b. cereus was found  at low numbers in product at both factories. the spontaneous fermentations associated with the production of sour cassava starch involve a few species of lactic acid bacteria at high numbers and a variety of yeasts at relatively low numbers.

TI  == probiotic and milk technological properties of lactobacillus brevis.
AB  == two lactobacillus brevis strains atcc 8287 and atcc 14869(t), were evaluated for  their applicability as putative probiotics in dairy products. the strains expressed good in vitro adherence to human caco-2 and intestine 407 cells and tolerated well low ph, bile acids and pancreatic fluid under in vitro conditions. in antimicrobial activity assays, strain atcc 8287 showed inhibitory properties toward selected potential harmful microorganisms, particularly against bacillus cereus. both l. brevis strains were resistant to vancomycin, which is typical for the genus lactobacillus. the l. brevis strains were not able to acidify milk to yoghurt but were suitable as supplement strains in yoghurts. this was shown by producing a set of yoghurt products and analysing their rheological and sensory properties during a cold storage period of 28 days. survival of the strains through human intestine was examined in 1-week feeding trials. despite its human  origin, l. brevis atcc 14869(t) could not survive through the gastrointestinal (gi) tract, whereas l. brevis atcc 8287 was detected in the faecal samples taken  during and immediately after ingestion of the strain. in conclusion, l. brevis atcc 8287 is a promising candidate as a probiotic supplement in dairy products.

TI  == antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  == antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (mws) were examined against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, salmonella typhimurium, and vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus megaterium, b. cereus, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus plantarum, l. brevis, and l. bulgaricus). chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and mws of chitosan. as a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by ph (ph 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower ph value.

TI  == effects of three microbial probiotics on postprandial porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose, galactose and amino-nitrogen in the young pig.
AB  == postprandial kinetics of porto-arterial concentration differences of glucose (g), galactose (gal), l-lactic acid (la) and amino-n (an) were studied in the piglet after the ingestion of 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu) sporolactobacillus p44 (sp), or 10(6) cfu bacillus cereus ip5832 (ac), or 10(6) cfu of a combination of  lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum and l. brevis (ab)/g feed. sixteen fistulated piglets (portal vein and brachiocephalic trunk; mean body weight 22 (sd 2) kg) were used. the diet was based on skimmed milk (320 g/kg), barley (300  g/kg), wheat bran (110 g/kg), maize (100 g/kg) and lactose (70 g/kg). the postprandial blood kinetics, four measurements per animal at 1-week intervals, were studied for 6 h after the ingestion of test meals of 400 g basal diet (bd) or this diet supplemented with the bacteria (sp, ac and ab respectively). areas of porto-arterial concentration differences (apacd) of g, gal and la were not influenced by the bacteria supplements. apacd of an was significantly higher after the ingestion of the sp diet than that estimated for bd.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == [spoilage microorganisms encountered in ultra-high temperature processed milk].
AB  == 40 strains of aerobic or facultative anaerobic microorganisms were isolated from  a total of 37 spoiled ultra high temperature processed milk. 13 of them were identified as the genus bacillus. they were 6 b. cereus, 5 b. licheniformis, 1 b. brevis and 1 b. pumilus. the other 27 strains were nonsporeforming microorganisms, which included 5 yeasts, 2 pseudomonas sp., 3 streptococcus sp.,  12 lactobacillus sp., 1 shigella sp., 1 aeromonas sp. and 3 micrococcus sp. results indicate that the spoilage of milk sample was caused mainly by the contamination during the filling operation. the bacillus strains isolated were mesophilic or thermophilic, and some of them, were also psychrotrophic.
