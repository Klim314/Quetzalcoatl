[terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of diversity of mucosa-associated microbiota in patients with crohn's disease].
objective: to explore the differences of colonic mucosal-associate bacterial diversity between the patients with crohn's disease (cd) and healthy controls. methods: eight cd patients and 23 healthy controls were recruited from september 2010 to december 2011 at west china hospital. one biopsy were taken from cecum of every patient with cd and healthy control by endoscopic examination. the diversity of colonic mucosa-associated microbiota was detected by terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) . hierarchical cluster analysis were performed to compare the similarity of microbial communities between cd patients and healthy controls. differences of bacterial diversity between two groups were also evaluated. the difference of predominant terminal-restrict fragments (t-rf) were analyzed and the bacterium predicted by predominant t-rfs were identified according to mica database. results: hierarchical cluster analysis showed that the mucosal microbial community of cd patients differed from healthy controls. and there were more similarities in the samples of same group than that of different groups. compared with healthy control group, the richness of mucosal microbiota in cd patients was lower (haeiii:7 +/- 4 vs 10 +/- 8, p = 0.048; mspi+haeiii:20 +/- 10 vs 24 +/- 12, p = 0.036). shannon-wiener index of cd patients was lower than healthy control (1.7 +/- 0.7 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5, p = 0.220) with no significant difference. species evenness and simpson index of cd patients were significantly greater than healthy controls (0.84 +/- 0.14 vs 0.77 +/- 0.13, p = 0.045; 0.25 +/- 0.16 vs 0.22 +/- 0.15, p = 0.038) . the t-rf of 37, 40 and 66 bp digested with mspi enzyme predominated in cd patients. relative quantitative analysis showed 35 bp t-rf digested with mspi was significantly higher in cd patients than that in healthy controls (36.8% (23.0%, 55.4%) vs 14.3% (9.5%, 19.5%), p = 0.001), and 74, 141, 486, 490 bp t-rfs were all significantly lower than healthy controls (3.2% (1.3%, 5.1%) vs 10.2% (5.4%, 17.3%), p = 0.001; 4.5% (1.7%, 7.1%) vs 10.8% (5.9%, 21.1%), p = 0.007; 4.2% (1.6%, 5.3%) vs 7.6% (5.9%, 9.3%), p = 0.022; 3.6% (2.4%, 6.1%) vs 18.3% (9.9%, 43.2%), p = 0.008). the mucosal bacterial community composition in cd patients was predominated by firmicutes, proteobacterium and actinobacterium. compare with healthy control, bacteroides were significantly reduced in cd patients while firmicutes (e.g. enterobacter sp.) and actinomycetaceae significantly increased. conclusions: dysbiosis of mucosal microbiota occurs in cd with decreases of richness and biodiversity. increased enterobacter sp., actinobacterium and decreased bacteroides may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cd.
in vitro activity of ly127935.
the activity of ly127935, a beta-lactam antibiotic of novel structure, was studied in vitro against facultative gram-negative bacilli, staphylococcus aureus, and bacteroides fragilis. the strains were recent clinical isolates, many of which were relatively resistant to other antibiotics. ly127935 exhibited striking activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., proteus sp., serratia marcescens, and b. fragilis with median minimum inhibitory concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 micrograms/ml. it was somewhat less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and s. aureus. cefotaxime (hr 756) showed very similar activity except that it was substantially weaker against b. fragilis. ly127935 was more active than cefamandole, cefoxitin, or piperacillin; it was also as potent as tobramycin or amikacin against all species except for p. aeruginosa.
[in vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
in vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (ab-pc), carbenicillin (cb-pc), sulbenicillin (sb-pc) cephalothin (cet), cefazolin (cez) and gentamicin (gm). fifty three % of escherichia coli strains 53.3% of citrobacter sp., 80% of proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of morganella and 80% of bacteroides sp. were susceptible (mic being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to ab-pc. the eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. cb-pc and sb-pc were almost as effective as ab-pc against escherichia coli and citrobacter sp. they were less active against klebsiella sp., but more active against enterobacter sp., serratia sp., indole-positive proteus group and pseudomonas sp. than ab-pc, sb-pc was more effective than cb-pc against pseudomonas sp. the strains of pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of cb-pc and sb-pc were pyocyanine-negative strains. all strains (100%) of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp. and citrobacter sp. were susceptible to cet and cez, while none of enterobacter sp. , serratia sp., proteus vulgaris. morganella, rettgerella, providencia and pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. the mics of cet and cez against bacteroides sp. were moderately low. some strains of providencia and alkaligenes sp. were resistant of gm but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high mics against bacteroides sp. when seen from the mic distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).
