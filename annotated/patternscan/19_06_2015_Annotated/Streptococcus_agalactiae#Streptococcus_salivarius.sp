TI  == streptococcus salivarius k12 limits group b streptococcus vaginal colonization.
AB  == streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus, gbs) colonizes the rectovaginal  tract in 20-30% of women and during pregnancy can be transmitted to the newborn,  causing severe invasive disease. current routine screening and antibiotic prophylaxis have fallen short of complete prevention of gbs transmission and gbs  remains a leading cause of neonatal infection. we have investigated the ability of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant member of the native human oral microbiota, to control gbs colonization. comparison of the antibacterial activity of multiple s. salivarius strains using a deferred antagonism test showed that s. salivarius k12 (k12) exhibited the broadest spectrum of activity against gbs. k12 effectively inhibited all gbs strains tested, including disease-implicated isolates from newborns, and colonizing isolates from the vaginal tract of pregnant women. inhibition was dependent on the presence of megaplasmid pssal-k12, which encodes the bacteriocins salivaricin a and salivaricin b; however, in co-culture experiments, gbs growth was impeded by k12 independent of  the megaplasmid. we also demonstrated that k12 adheres to and invades human vaginal epithelial cells at levels comparable to gbs. inhibitory activity of k12  was examined in vivo using a mouse model of gbs vaginal colonization. mice colonized with gbs were treated vaginally with k12. k12 administration significantly reduced gbs vaginal colonization compared to non-treated controls,  and this effect was partially dependent on the k12 megaplasmid. our results suggest that k12 may have potential as a preventative therapy to control gbs vaginal colonization and thereby prevent its transmission to the neonate during pregnancy.

TI  == transduction of the streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage phim46.1, carrying resistance genes mef(a) and tet(o), to other streptococcus species.
AB  == phim46.1 - streptococcus pyogenes bacteriophage carrying mef(a) and tet(o), respectively, encoding resistance to macrolides (m phenotype) and tetracycline -  is widespread in s. pyogenes but has not been reported outside this species. phim46.1 is transferable in vitro among s. pyogenes isolates, but no information  is available about its transferability to other streptococcus species. we thus investigated phim46.1 for its ability to be transduced in vitro to recipients of  different streptococcus species. transductants were obtained from recipients of streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus suis. retransfer was always achieved, and from s. suis to s. pyogenes occurred at a much greater frequency than in the opposite direction. in transductants phim46.1  retained its functional properties, such as inducibility with mitomycin c, presence both as a prophage and as a free circular form, and transferability. the transductants shared the same phim46.1 chromosomal integration site as the donor, at the 3' end of a conserved rna uracil methyltransferase (rum) gene, which is an integration hotspot for a variety of genetic elements. no transfer occurred to recipients of streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius, even though rum-like genes were also detected in the sequenced genomes of these species. a largely overlapping 18-bp critical sequence, where the site-specific recombination process presumably takes place, was identified in the rum genes of all recipients, including those of the species yielding no transductants. growth assays to evaluate the fitness cost of phim46.1 acquisition disclosed a negligible impact on s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, and s. gordonii transductants and a noticeable fitness advantage in s. suis. the s. suis transductant also displayed marked overexpression of the autolysin-encoding gene  atl.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo effects of beneficial vaginal lactobacilli on pathogens responsible for urogenital tract infections.
AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of beneficial human vaginal lactobacilli (lb) on urogenital pathogens through in vitro and in vivo experiments. co-aggregative and antimicrobial properties between five vaginal lb  strains and urogenital pathogens or potential pathogens (streptococcus agalactiae, staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans strains) were assayed. also, associative cultures of lb strains and s. agalactiae were performed and bacterial growth, ph, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) were determined at different times. based on the results obtained, the in vivo studies were assayed  in mice with lactobacillus gasseri crl 1509 or lactobacillus salivarius crl 1328  inoculated intravaginally (i.v.) and then challenged i.v. with s. agalactiae. results were analysed by anova (repeated measures and general linear models). most of the lb strains increased the percentage of aggregation of s. agalactiae strains. only one strain (lactobacillus reuteri crl 1324) positively affected the aggregation of s. aureus and none increased the aggregation of c. albicans. the inhibition of the growth of s. agalactiae strains by production of organic acids  by lactobacilli was evidenced. the lb-s. agalactiae co-cultures showed a significant inhibition of the pathogen after 4 h and 8 h of incubation. parallel  increases in lactic acid and h2o2 levels were observed. however, in the experimental murine model, no significant differences were obtained in the number of streptococci recovered from the vaginal tract of control mice and those inoculated with lb. in conclusion, vaginal lb exhibited in vitro co-aggregative and antimicrobial effects on s. agalactiae strains, suggesting that they could be promising candidates for protection against s. agalactiae challenge. however, as  these effects were not evidenced in the murine model used, further animal studies under different experimental conditions should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effect of lb against challenge with s. agalactiae.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == endocarditis in adults with bacterial meningitis.
AB  == background: endocarditis may precede or complicate bacterial meningitis, but the  incidence and impact of endocarditis in bacterial meningitis are unknown. methods and results: we assessed the incidence and clinical characteristics of patients with meningitis and endocarditis from a nationwide cohort study of adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis in the netherlands from 2006 to 2012. endocarditis was identified in 24 of 1025 episodes (2%) of bacterial meningitis.  cultures yielded streptococcus pneumoniae in 13 patients, staphylococcus aureus in 8 patients, and streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus salivarius in 1 patient each. clues leading to the diagnosis of endocarditis were cardiac murmurs, persistent or recurrent fever, a history of heart valve disease, and s aureus as the causative pathogen of bacterial meningitis. treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy in all patients and surgical valve replacement in 10 patients (42%). two patients were treated with oral anticoagulants, and both developed life-threatening intracerebral hemorrhage. systemic (70%) and neurological (54%) complications occurred frequently, leading to a high proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome (63%). seven of 24 patients (29%) with meningitis and endocarditis died. conclusions: endocarditis is an uncommon coexisting condition in bacterial meningitis but is associated with a high rate of unfavorable outcome.

TI  == comparative genomics and the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of bovine adapted streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  == in addition to causing severe invasive infections in humans, streptococcus agalactiae, or group b streptococcus (gbs), is also a major cause of bovine mastitis. here we provide the first genome sequence for s. agalactiae isolated from a cow diagnosed with clinical mastitis (strain fsl s3-026). comparison to eight s. agalactiae genomes obtained from human disease isolates revealed 183 genes specific to the bovine strain. subsequent polymerase chain reaction (pcr) screening for the presence/absence of a subset of these loci in additional bovine and human strains revealed strong differentiation between the two groups (fisher  exact test: p<0.0001). the majority of the bovine strain-specific genes ( approximately 85%) clustered tightly into eight genomic islands, suggesting these genes were acquired through lateral gene transfer (lgt). this bovine gbs also contained an unusually high proportion of insertion sequences (4.3% of the total  genome), suggesting frequent genomic rearrangement. comparison to other mastitis-causing species of bacteria provided strong evidence for two cases of interspecies lgt within the shared bovine environment: bovine s. agalactiae with  streptococcus uberis (nisin u operon) and streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae (lactose operon). we also found evidence for lgt, involving the salivaricin operon, between the bovine s. agalactiae strain and either streptococcus pyogenes or streptococcus salivarius. our findings provide insight  into mechanisms facilitating environmental adaptation and acquisition of potential virulence factors, while highlighting both the key role lgt has played  in the recent evolution of the bovine s. agalactiae strain, and the importance of lgt among pathogens within a shared environment.

TI  == ozone in dentistry: microbiological effects of gas action depending on the method and the time of application using the ozonytron device. experimental study.
AB  == introduction: bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal activity of ozone is generally known and has been exploited for years in industry and medicine. ozone  therapy became an inherent element of the treatment of infection in such fields as surgery, dermatology, cosmetics, and dentistry. ozone is a gas, so it penetrates very well even into such tissues and spaces that are not easily accessible. thanks to the property of deep penetration and long ozone presence in tissues after treatment, a long-lasting bactericidal effect is achieved. the action of oxygen radicals is, however, not neutral for the human organism, therefore the use of an appropriate procedure and therapy algorithms is essential. material and methods: we decided to confirm the effect of antibacterial activity of ozone applied by means of the ozonytron device (made by biozonix) on model strains of streptococcus salivarius, pneumonia, pyogenes, and  agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis, using two application patterns developed by us. results: we found a statistically significant difference in the size of zones of inhibited bacterial growth on all  media depending on the time of action of ozone. in the present paper, the bactericidal activity of ozone in relation to bacterial strains that are most frequently isolated from the oral cavity was confirmed. what is more, two models  of application of the gas on the infected medium were compared. conclusion: research on the use of ozone in combatting bacteria typical for dental diseases has shown that the gas has an oxidizing effect on these bacteria and is bactericidal.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples in korea.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial resistance of streptococci isolated from mastitic bovine milk samples. a total of 178 isolates  belonging to 6 different streptococcus species were examined: s. uberis (n = 99), s. bovis (n = 30), s. oralis (n = 24), s. salivarius (n = 13), s. intermedius (n  = 7), and s. agalactiae (n = 5). only 8.9% (16/178) of the isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested in this study, and s. agalactiae and s. intermedius isolates were all resistant to at least 1 antimicrobial agent  tested. overall, the most frequently observed resistance was to tetracycline (61.2%), followed by lincomycin (43.2%), gentamycin (35.3%), oxacillin (34.3%), and erythromycin (28.6%). cephalothin and penicillin were the only antimicrobial  agents to which most of the streptococci (>or=92%) were susceptible. wide differences in the prevalence of resistance are apparent among the individual species: s. salivarius displayed exceptionally high resistance to cephalothin (23.0%) and oxacillin (76.9%) and s. agalactiae (20%) and s. intermedius (14.2%)  to penicillin. streptococcus salivarius and s. agalactiae were all susceptible to erythromycin, but others showed various rates of resistance ranging from 12.5% to 42.8%. resistance to 3 or more of 7 antimicrobial agents was observed in all species (37.6%, 67/178).

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == characterization of the lancefield group c streptococcus 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacer and its potential for identification and sub-specific typing.
AB  == the 16s-23s rna gene intergenic spacers of isolates of streptococcus equi (n = 5), s. zooepidemicus (n = 5), s. equisimilis (n = 3) and s. dysgalactiae (n = 2)  were sequenced and compared. there were distinct regions within the spacer, arranged in the order 1-9 for all s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate and 1,2 and 4-9 for the remaining isolates. region 4 was identical to the trna(ala) gene found in the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of other streptococci. regions 1, 5, 6 and 7 had distinct variations, each conserved in different isolates. however, amongst the intergenic spacers there were different combinations of variant regions, suggesting a role for dna recombination in their evolution. the intergenic spacer of all isolates of s. equi and one s. zooepidemicus isolate were almost identical. primers derived from the variant sequences of regions 1 and 5 to 6 were used to group all s. zooepidemicus (n = 17) and s. equi (n = 5) into 1 of 8 types by polymerase chain reaction; three s. zooepidemicus isolates typed the same as s. equi. s. equi and s. zooepidemicus were clearly distinguishable from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae which had shorter regions 5 and 6 and no region 7. most homology for the group c sequences was found in previously published sequences for the 16s-23s intergenic spacers of s. anginosis, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. salivarius and s. agalactiae. a 75-90 nucleotide length shared with s. anginosus and s. intermedius in opposite orientations in the two main variants of region 6 supported the role for dna recombination in the evolution of the spacer. the 16s-23s intergenic spacers indicate that s. zooepidemicus was the archetypal species for s. equi and that both are genetically more distant from s. equisimilis and s. dysgalactiae. the intergenic spacer can be used to identify specifically the group c streptococci and as an epidemiological marker for s. zooepidemicus.

TI  == [the isolation of streptococcus morbillorum from vaginal exudates].
AB  == we have tested 195 vaginal secretions sent by gynecology service of this hospital between the years 1988-1990. we achieved positive culture for streptococci in 58  (30%) of these cultures, 26 (44.8%) corresponding to streptococcus morbillorum 9  (15.5%), to gardnerella vaginalis 5 (8.6%), to enterococcus faecalis-durans and to streptococcus agalactiae, 3 (5.1%) to streptococcus mitis and milleri 2 (3.4%), to streptococcus bovis and cremoris, and 1 (1.7%) to streptococcus salivarius, equinus and sanguis ii respectively. we previously found that 52.8% of these patients were positive for vaginal candidiasis. the bacteriological identification done by the api 20 strep system (biomerieux gmbh, nutingen, germany) provides a typical pattern ("good identification") for the streptococcus morbillorum.

TI  == evaluation of bacterial interference and beta-lactamase production in management  of experimental infection with group a beta-hemolytic streptococci.
AB  == the in vivo effects of penicillin and cefprozil therapy on the interaction between organisms commonly recovered from inflamed tonsils were studied by using  a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. these organisms were group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (gabhs), streptococcus salivarius (which is capable of interfering with gabhs), and staphylococcus aureus. in mice infected with gabhs and s. salivarius alone or in combination, penicillin eliminated both organisms and cefprozil eliminated gabhs and s. aureus but not s. salivarius. penicillin did not, however, reduce the number of gabhs or s. salivarius in the presence of s. aureus. the present study demonstrated the ability of beta-lactamase-producing s. aureus to protect gabhs from penicillin. however, no such protection was present  following the administration of cefprozil. furthermore, the preservation of s. salivarius that interferes with gabhs growth may provide protection from reinfection with gabhs. this study supports and provides an explanation for the increased efficacies of cephalosporins administered orally over that of penicillin when treating patients with acute gabhs pharyngitis or tonsillitis.

TI  == restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s ribosomal dna of streptococcus and enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  == twelve bacterial species including streptococcus uberis, s. parauberis, s. agalactiae, s. dysgalactiae, s. bovis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. saccharolyticus, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, e. avium, and aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16s ribosomal dna fingerprint patterns. oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16s rrna genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16s ribosomal gene fragments from genomic dnas. the molecular sizes of the amplified 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16s rdna was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. all 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16s rdna fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases hhai, rsai, and mspi. a scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from  cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16s rdna fingerprinting. all 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using hhai, rsai, and mspi restriction endonucleases. the results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16s rdna fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == exogenous thymidine and reversal of the inhibitory effect of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim on streptococci.
AB  == the practice of using sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (sxt) for the selective isolation of streptococcus pyogenes and as a taxonomic character in the presumptive identification of streptococci was applied to 17 strains of different groups of streptococci to determine their characteristic behaviour in the presence of exogenous thymidine. streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and group d enterococci utilized thymidine, the first two species obtaining a maximum reversal of the inhibitory effect of sxt at thymidine concentrations of 1.2 micrograms/ml and 0.6 micrograms/ml or higher, respectively. for group d enterococci, the degree of reversal of the inhibitory effect was proportional to  the thymidine concentration. in contrast, the four viridans species studied (streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis ii) and streptococcus pneumoniae were unable to utilize thymidine from an exogenous source and thus growth remained inhibited even at the highest concentrations of thymidine tested. for selective isolation and identification of streptococci only stable media with batch-to-batch consistency  are recommended together with a known quantity of thymidine.
