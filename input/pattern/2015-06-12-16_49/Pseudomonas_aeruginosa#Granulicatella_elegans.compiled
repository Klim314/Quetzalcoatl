TI  - Molecular analysis of bacterial flora associated with chronically inflamed maxillary sinuses.
AB  - Chronic maxillary sinusitis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the role of microbial infection remains undefined. Bacteria have been isolated from chronically inflamed sinuses; however, their role in the chronicity of inflammation is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine whether bacteria are present in clinical samples from chronic maxillary sinusitis and to assess the diversity of the flora present. Washes and/or tissue samples from endoscopic sinus surgery on 11 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis were subjected to PCR amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA using three universal primer pairs, followed by cloning and sequencing. The samples were also assessed for the presence of bacteria and fungi by conventional culture methods. Viable bacteria and/or bacterial 16S rDNA were detected from maxillary sinus samples of five of the 11 patients examined (45 %). Three sinus samples were positive by both PCR and culture methods, one was positive only by PCR, and one only by culture. Thirteen bacterial species were identified: Abiotrophia defectiva, Enterococcus avium, Eubacterium sp., Granulicatella elegans, Neisseria sp., Prevotella sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and Streptococcus sp. Fungi were not detected. In one patient Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis, and in another patient Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected from both the sinus and the oral cavity using species-specific PCR primers. These results suggest that both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria can be detected in nearly half of chronic maxillary sinusitis cases.
