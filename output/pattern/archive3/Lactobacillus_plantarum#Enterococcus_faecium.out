in vitro study of beneficial properties and safety of lactic acid bacteria isolated from portuguese fermented meat products.
many lactic acid bacteria produce bacteriocins with a rather broad spectrum of inhibition, which could offer potential applications in food preservation. bacteriocin production by starter cultures may bring advantage to these strains in competitive interactions with pathogenic bacteria from the food matrix. the objective of this study was to determine the safety of beneficial strains (lactobacillus plantarum st202ch and st216ch, enterococcus faecium st211ch, and lactobacillus sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch) previously isolated from fermented meat products and characterised as bacteriocin producers. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values of 28.97, 27.86 and 28.56% were recorded for l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, respectively, 16.95 and 14.58% for l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, respectively, and 12.77% for e. faecium st211ch. various degrees of co-aggregation between 28.85 and 44.76% for listeria monocytogenes 211 and 409, and between 23.60 to 34.96% for e. faecium atcc 19443 were observed. according to the results of the diffusion method, the studied strains demonstrated susceptibility to penicillin g, ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, imipenem, linezolid, and tetracycline. in addition, the susceptibility of the six strains to various non-antibiotic commercial drugs was examined. production of beta-galactosidase by l. sakei st22ch, st153ch and st154ch, l. plantarum st202ch and st216ch, and e. faecium st211ch was confirmed by employing sterile filter paper discs impregnated with o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranose. a statistically significant (p<0.001) inhibition of mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by bacteriocins produced by l. plantarum st202ch (38.3%) and st216ch (48.6%), l. sakei st153ch (16.2%) and st154ch (16.1%), and e. faecium st211ch (21.7%) was observed. as determined by the polymerase chain reaction, the tested strains showed a low virulence gene profile.
isolation and identification of bacteriocinogenic strain of lactobacillus plantarum with potential beneficial properties from donkey milk.
aims: the goal of this study was to isolate and characterize a lactic acid bacteria (lab) from donkey milk with potential beneficial properties. methods and results: lactic acid bacteria were isolated from donkey milk and identified based on physiological, biochemical and molecular methods. the isolate that presented highest bacteriocin potential (lactobacillus plantarum lp08ad) was evaluated for the production of bacteriocin, including stability in the presence of various enzymes, surfactants, salts, ph and temperatures. bactericidal effect of bacteriocin lp08ad on listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecium and lactobacillus curvatus was shown for actively growing and stationary cells. similar growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain lp08ad was cultured in mrs broth at 30 degrees c or 37 degrees c. bacteriocin lp08ad adhered at low levels on the producer cells (200 au ml(-1) ). the presence of plantaricin w gene on the genomic dna was recorded based on pcr. good growth for strain lp08ad was recorded in mrs broth with ph from 5.0 to 9.0 and lp08ad grew well in the absence of oxbile or concentration below 0.8%. lact. plantarum lp08ad was applied to the small intestinal epithelial polarized monolayers of h4, psic1 and clab and demonstrated low attachment ability on all cell lines studied, with values with a similar behaviour for cells from human and pig origin. conclusions: bacteriocin-producing lact. plantarum lp08ad might be useful in the design of novel functional foods with potential probiotic or biopreservation properties. significance and impact of the study: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and characterization of bacteriocinogenic lact. plantarum from donkey milk. the strain lp08ad shows to have potential beneficial properties, as demonstrated by the use of noncancerogenic cell lines.
isolation and characterization of lactic acid bacteria from jiang-sun (fermented  bamboo shoots), a traditional fermented food in taiwan.
background: in this study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated, characterized and identified from jiang-sun (fermented bamboo shoots; a traditional fermented food in taiwan). samples were collected at seven time intervals from a fixed fermenting bucket during the fermentation process of jiang-sun and its initial ingredients, dochi (fermented soybeans) and bamboo shoots. results: a total of 57 lab cultures were isolated; 42 cultures were isolated from jiang-sun samples and 15 cultures were isolated from dochi and bamboo shoots. these isolates were characterized phenotypically and then divided into three groups (a-c) by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of 16s ribosomal dna. alteration of microbial populations during the fermentation process was observed. while various lab were found in the dochi and bamboo shoots, it was mostly replaced by lactobacillus plantarum after 1 day of fermentation. furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the isolates were determined, and one enterococcus faecium strain showed inhibitory activity against all the indicator strains. conclusion: results suggest that l. plantarum is the main lab present during the fermentation of jiang-sun. to our knowledge, this is the first report describing the distribution and varieties of lab that exist in the jiang-sun fermentation process.
characterization of bacteriocins produced by two strains of lactobacillus plantarum isolated from beloura and chourico, traditional pork products from portugal.
bacteriocins bacst202ch and bacst216ch, produced by lactobacillus plantarum strains isolated from beloura and chourico, respectively, inhibited the growth of a number of gram-positive and gram-negative meat spoilage bacteria. according to trycine-sds-page, bacst202ch and bacst216ch are approximately 3.5 and 10.0 kda in size, respectively. maximal activity of bacst202ch (25,600 au/ml) was recorded after 27 h of and bacst216ch (102,400 au/ml) after 22 h of growth. the mode of activity, as determined against enterococcus faecium hklhs, is bactericidal. both peptides adsorb to the surface of the producer cells, but at very low concentrations. both peptides remained active after 120 min at 100 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0. treatment for 120 min at 121 degrees c did not affect bacst216ch activity. activity of bacst202ch and bacst216ch was not affected by 1% triton x-100, tween 80, tween 20, sds, nacl, urea and edta. bacteriocin st216ch was deactivated in the presence of 1% triton x-114. the nucleotide sequence of a 1044 bp dna fragment amplified from l. plantarum st202ch is identical to the structural gene encoding pediocin pa-1, suggesting that the two bacteriocins are identical. based on the broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, strains st202ch and st216ch may be used as starter cultures in the fermentation of meat products.
coculture with specific bacteria enhances survival of lactobacillus plantarum nc8, an autoinducer-regulated bacteriocin producer, in olive fermentations.
bacteriocin production in lactobacillus plantarum nc8 is activated by coculture with specific bacteriocin production-inducing bacterial strains. the system is further regulated by a three-component regulatory system involving a specific autoinducer peptide (plnc8if). we have used l. plantarum nc8 as a starter culture in spanish-style green olive fermentations and examined the influence of coculturing in its survival. we found that l. plantarum nc8 greatly enhanced its growth and survival in the olive fermentations when co-inoculated with two specific bacteriocin-production inducing strains, i.e. enterococcus faecium 6t1a-20 and pediococcus pentosaceus fbb63, when compared to singly-inoculated fermentations. in addition, a constitutive bacteriocin-producer nc8-derivative strain was used as a control in the olive fermentations and showed also better viability than the parental nc8 strain. our results suggest the involvement of bacteriocin production in the viability enhancement found in both cases. we postulate that the presence of specific bacteria is recognized by l. plantarum nc8 as an environmental stimulus to switch a specific adaptive response on, most probably involving bacteriocin production. the design of novel bacteriocin-producing starter cultures for food fermentations should consider their constitutive versus regulated character.
isolation and characterisation of selected lactic acid bacteria for improved processing of nem chua, a traditional fermented meat from vietnam.
nem chua is a traditional lactic acid fermented meat of vietnam that is consumed  raw. during fermentation, the number of acid-producing bacteria increased significantly and by the final day (4th), it had reached approximately 8.4 log cfu/g, contributing to 94% of the total microbiota of the product. out of 85 isolates obtained from the product, only 44 were confirmed gram-positive and catalase-negative. these putative lab isolates were purified and screened for antimicrobial and proteolytic activity. none of the isolates showed bacteriocin activity using the 'spot-on lawn' method, but showed antimicrobial activity against lactobacillus sakei and enterococcus faecium using deferred assay. four isolates showed good proteolytic activities at ph 7.0. these isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum using an api 50 chl i.d. kit. sequencing of the partial 16s rrna gene amplified by primers 1101f (5'-aacgagcgcaaccc-3') and 1407r (5'-gacgggcggtgtgtac-3') showed 98% homology to lactobacillus plantarum wcfs1.
characterization of the beneficial properties of lactobacilli isolated from bullfrog (rana catesbeiana) hatchery.
the present work addresses the isolation and partial identification of the microbial population of a r. catesbeiana hatchery in spring and summer as well as some beneficial properties of lactobacillus strains isolated in different seasons and hatchery areas. the bacterial population was grouped into the following taxa: lactobacillus spp., pediococcus spp., enterococcus faecalis and ent. faecium, and enterobacteriaceae (enterobacter spp., escherichia coli) while pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated from frogs displaying red-leg syndrome. the lactobacillus plantarum and l. curvatus strains isolated showed to inhibit the growth of red-leg syndrome associated pathogens and food-borne bacteria by organic acids. while l. plantarum crl 1606 also inhibited red-leg syndrome related pathogens by hydrogen peroxide, meat spoilage bacteria were only inhibited by acidity. however, by using a mrs medium added with tetramethyl-benzidine and peroxidase, a high percentage of h(2)o(2)-producing lactobacilli were detected. the surface properties of lactobacillus strains showed that a few strains were able to agglutinate abo human erythrocytes, while the highest number of strains had a low to medium degree of hydrophobicity. this paper constitute the first study related to the beneficial properties of lactobacillus isolated from a bullfrog hatchery, as well as the selection criteria applied to a group of strains, which could help to control or prevent bacterial infectious diseases in raniculture.
characterization and antimicrobial spectrum of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional bulgarian dairy products.
aims: to isolate bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) with high wide  spectrum antibacterial activity and to characterize their inhibitory peptides. method and results: seven lab strains [lactobacillus casei ssp. rhamnosus (pc5), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (bb18), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (bcm5, bk15), enterococcus faecium (mh3), lactobacillus plantarum (br12), lactobacillus casei ssp. casei (bcz2)], isolated from authentic bulgarian dairy products were capable of producing bacteriocins, inhibiting the widest range of pathogenic bacteria. the bacteriocins were resistant to heating at 121 degrees c for 15 min, stable at ph 2-10, sensitive to protease, insensitive to alpha-amylase and lipase. two of bacteriocins produced by lact. bulgaricus bb18 (bulgaricin bb18) and e. faecium mh3 (enterocin mh3) were purified and the molecular masses were determined. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of bulgaricin bb18 did not show strong homology to other known bacteriocins. conclusions: lactobacillus bulgaricus bb18 and e. faecium mh3 produce two novel bacteriocins highly similar to the pediocin-like nonlantibiotics. significance and impact of the study: the two bacteriocins are potential antimicrobial agents and, in conjunction with their producers, may have use in applications to contribute a positive effect on the balance of intestinal microflora. furthermore, bulgaricin bb18 strongly inhibits helicobacter pylori.
[study of some properties of strain lactobacillus plantarum g3/3(13) antagonistic factor].
the screening of strains which expressed antagonistic activity, that is not connected with lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide synthesis was conducted among 72 cultures of lactic acid bacteria. the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) which inhibited growth of 11 test-cultures including lactobacillus plantarum, enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium was selected. the antibacterial factor was of protein nature, did not retain the activity after boiling and was active at ph 2.0-8.0, whereas at ph 9.0 its activity fell significantly. the obtained results allow to assume that the formed agent can be bacteriocin-like substance and the strain l. plantarum g3/3(13) may be useful for food industry or probiotic construction.
in vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to china with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. in this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. the cell growth of streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of s. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. the bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on s. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); ph, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis, with mics ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of ph in the broth. thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
fermentation of raw poultry byproducts for animal nutrition.
in this study, the fermentation of raw, inedible poultry byproducts mixed with sugarbeet pulp and dextrose and inoculated with lactobacillus plantarum and(or) enteroccocus faecium resulted in a drop of ph in the byproducts to approximately 4.0 to 4.5 within 48 h. to keep the fermented product stable for a period of 21 d, the addition of > or = 3% (wt/wt) of a fermentable carbohydrate was necessary. with a high inoculation level of approximately 10(8) to 10(9) l. plantarum per gram, or with acidification of the initial mixture with .4% lactic acid, the number of enterobacteriaceae decreased faster than with inoculation at 10(5) l. plantarum per gram, or without initial acidification. after 21 d of fermentation, a high level of enzymatic breakdown of proteins and amino acids was observed: the nonprotein n level increased from 5% to between 15 and 40% of total n and the volatile n level increased from 1% to between 3 and 11% of total n. an increase in histamine, cadaverine, and putrescine was also observed. despite the technological measures taken, such as the application of a high inoculum of starter culture and initial acidification with .4% lactic acid, this amino acid breakdown could not be reduced to an acceptable level. these results suggest that, because of biochemical deterioration, fermentation alone is not a useful method of preservation of raw poultry byproducts.
